## Biography
John Forté (January 30, 1975 – January 12, 2026) was an American rapper, record producer, and musician born in Brownsville, Brooklyn, New York City. A musical prodigy, he studied classical violin, enjoying Vivaldi's work, and won a scholarship to Phillips Exeter Academy, graduating in 1993. After high school, he briefly attended NYU as a music business major, rooming with Talib Kweli, before dropping out to work as an A&R executive at Rawkus Records[1][4].

Forté's career launched in the early 1990s when Lauryn Hill introduced him to the Fugees. He co-wrote and produced tracks on their 1996 Grammy-winning album *The Score*, earning a Grammy nomination at age 21, and toured worldwide with the group. His style blended hip-hop, reggae, soul, and socially conscious lyrics. He contributed to Wyclef Jean's *The Carnival* (1997), collaborated with Pras on 'Avenues' from the *Money Talks* soundtrack, and released his debut *Poly Sci* (1998), produced by Wyclef Jean, featuring DMX, Fat Joe, and others. Later albums included *I, John* (2002), *Stylefree the EP* (2009), *Water Light Sound* (2011), *Riddem Drive* (2020), and *Vessels, Angels & Ancestors* (2021)[1][2][3].

In 2000, Forté was arrested at Newark Airport for drug trafficking, sentenced to 14 years, but released after commutation by President George W. Bush in 2008, aided by advocates like Carly Simon. Post-prison, he toured, founded Le Castle production company in 2011, and married photographer Lara Fuller in 2017, with whom he had two children. He was found dead at his home in Chilmark, Massachusetts, on January 12, 2026, at age 50, with no foul play suspected[1][3]. His legacy endures through innovative productions bridging street and mainstream hip-hop.
