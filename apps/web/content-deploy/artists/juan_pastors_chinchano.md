## Biography
Juan Daniel Pastor, a dynamic jazz percussionist, composer, and educator, was born and raised in Lima, Peru, where his early life was immersed in the rich traditions of Peruvian folk music, particularly Afro-Peruvian rhythms. Growing up in a home filled with traditional sounds, he developed his skills on instruments like the cajon and congas under the mentorship of Afro-Peruvian master Eusebio Sirio “Pititi.” This foundation shaped his unique musical voice, blending evocative Peruvian percussion with contemporary jazz harmonies.[1][3]

Pursuing his passion for jazz, Pastor relocated to Chicago around 2008, earning a Bachelor of Music in Jazz Studies from Northern Illinois University and a Master of Music from DePaul University. There, he received guidance from mentors Greg Beyer and Dana Hall. In 2013, he founded the ensemble Chinchano, which fuses Afro-Peruvian rhythms with North American jazz, releasing albums including the self-titled debut, 'Un Cambio,' 'El Regreso' (2019), 'Cachito' (dedicated to his late father Carlos), and 'Memorias' (the fifth album). Chinchano has performed at prestigious venues like the North Sea Jazz Festival, Lima Jazz Festival, and Chicago Latin Jazz Festival.[1][2][6]

Beyond performing, Pastor serves as Coordinator of the Jazz Program at North Central College, where he is a half-time lecturer, and is authoring 'Batería Peruana,' a book on polyrhythmic grooves from Peruvian folk music. His work reflects his life between Lima and Chicago, earning international acclaim for its innovative fusion.[1]

## Fun Facts
- Juan Pastor plays the cajon—a simple wooden box common in Peruvian homes—by sitting on it and striking it with his hands to produce bass and high tones for Afro-Peruvian dances.[3]
- His album 'Cachito' is dedicated to his late father Carlos Pastor, whom he mourned after returning from his funeral in Lima around 2021.[3][6]
- Despite a successful career with international performances and grants like the DCASE Grant from Chicago, Pastor has struggled with U.S. immigration, joking that even a Grammy might be required for his green card.[3]
- Chinchano's 'El Regreso' features a cover of Wilfredo Franco Laguna's 'Mayoral,' addressing Spanish colonial racism with Festejo rhythms.[2]
