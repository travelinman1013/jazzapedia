## Biography
Victor Harris, known as Big Chief Victor 'Spirit of Fi Yi Yi' Harris, is a New Orleans cultural icon from the 7th Ward who began masking as a Mardi Gras Black Indian in 1965 at age 15 as a flag boy with the Yellow Pocahontas tribe under Big Chief Allison 'Tootie' Montana. As a young man, he coached youth sports at Hunter’s Field, earning the nickname 'Duck' for entertaining children, and became involved in civil rights activism, marching on City Hall in the early 1970s with the Tambourine & Fan Club to secure a park under Interstate 10. In 1983, after a dispute over record credits led to his ousting from Yellow Pocahontas, Harris experienced a spiritual vision in 1984, founding the Spirit of Fi Yi Yi tribe and the Mandingo Warriors gang, pioneering an African-inspired style with full-face beaded masks, cowrie shells, and no glue or staples, distinct from traditional suits.[1][2][3][4]

Harris led the tribe for decades, performing shamanic chants, sermons, and African-New Orleans drumming rhythms at events like St. Joseph’s Night and Jazz Fest, with his suits evolving in neo-African and Cubist styles across colors like red. A visual artist, performer, musician, historian, and curator, he emphasized revolutionary spirit and community unity, supporting the Backstreet Cultural Museum. By 2020, health issues including knee problems and arthritis forced his retirement after 55 years masking, passing leadership to his son 'Little' Victor, who served as Second Chief; Harris continued cultural work, including a 2026 residency designing masks and shields.[3][4][6]

The Spirit of Fi Yi Yi and Mandingo Warriors represent a transformative force in Black Indian culture, documented in the 2018 book 'Fire in the Hole: The Spirit Work of Fi Yi Yi & the Mandingo Warriors,' an oral history with over 200 photos capturing their ecstatic performances. Harris's legacy endures through his innovative suits, activism, and role in preserving New Orleans' masking traditions amid challenges like deaths and illness in his sewing committee.[1][7][8]
