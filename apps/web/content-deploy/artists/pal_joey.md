## Biography
Joseph Longo, professionally known as Pal Joey, was born and raised in Queens, New York City, as an Italian-American whose early life was shaped by disco, early hip-hop, and the vibrant street culture of 1980s NYC. Taking his alias from the classic Broadway musical featuring Frank Sinatra—a nod influenced by his father's admiration for the singer—Longo began experimenting with music through 'pause tapes' (primitive mixtapes), progressing to drum machines, vocal sampling, reel-to-reel editing, and razors for splicing breakbeats and disco samples. Working at the influential Vinylmania record shop near the Paradise Garage, he immersed himself in house and hip-hop scenes, developing a raw, swinging style blending moody deep house with jazz-inflected grooves.[1][2][3]

By the late 1980s and early 1990s, Pal Joey emerged as a New York house pioneer, releasing seminal tracks like 'Hot Music' (1989), 'Dance' (as Earth People, 1989), and 'Party Time' under aliases such as DreamHouse and Los Dos on labels including his own Loop-D-Loop, Cabaret, and Foot Stompin'. His music stood out for its off-kilter rhythms, loose grooves indebted to hip-hop and soulful house, earning him a reputation among connoisseurs despite less mainstream recognition compared to peers like Larry Heard or Kerri Chandler. He held a residency at the chic Nell’s club, mixing hip-hop, reggae, and dance classics, while engineering on Eric B. & Rakim’s 'Follow the Leader' and producing Boogie Down Productions’ 'Love’s Gonna Getcha'.[1][2][3]

Pal Joey's remixing credits include high-profile tracks for Deee-Lite ('How Do You Say… Love'), Sade ('Cherish the Day'), and others like Shabba Ranks, Lisa Stansfield, Sisqo, MC Lyte, and KRS-One, cementing his influence on deep, sample-heavy house. In 2013, BBE released *Pal Joey Presents Hot Music*, a 23-track compilation spanning 24 years, highlighting his enduring legacy as house music resurfaced, with tracks sampled by EPMD, Common, Missy Elliott, and Ghostface Killah.[1][2][3]
