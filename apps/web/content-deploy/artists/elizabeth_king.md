## Biography
Elizabeth King, a sacred soul and gospel singer, was born and raised in Charleston, Mississippi, where she grew up immersed in music—her mother sang in church, her father played harmonica, and she won talent shows as a child. At age nine, she fell seriously ill, but singing through the night led to her miraculous recovery, solidifying music as her lifelong expression of faith. In 1960, she moved to Memphis, Tennessee, sang in church, played piano in a local quartet, and briefly relocated to Chicago before returning. A devastating 1969 car accident caused by a drunk driver left her with severe injuries, including predictions she would never walk again, but she recovered fully, attributing it to divine intervention, and rededicated her life to gospel music.

King's professional career launched in 1969 with her debut single 'Testify' on the Designer label, followed by signing with D-Vine Spirituals in 1970 as the frontwoman for the all-male Gospel Souls, recording five singles and an album, including the hit 'I Heard the Voice' by 1973. She bore 15 children and paused secular recording in the mid-1970s to focus on family, church singing, and weekly gospel radio, turning down label offers. Her powerful contralto style blends sacred soul, gospel, and hints of funk, described as a 'foghorn of life' built from personal trials. In 2019, Rev. Juan D. Shipp reconnected her with producer Bruce Watson of Bible & Tire Recording Company, leading to her solo debut 'Living in the Last Days' (2021) at age 77, followed by 'I Got A Love' (2023) and 'Soul Provider' (2024).

King's late-career resurgence highlights her enduring legacy as a Memphis gospel pioneer, performing weekly on radio since the 1960s and leading church services, her music a testament to resilience and spiritual depth.
