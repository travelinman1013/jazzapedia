## Biography
Niuver is a Cuban-French singer and instrumentalist born in Bolondrón, a small town in Matanzas Province, Cuba. She began her musical education at age 11, studying in Matanzas before earning admission to Cuba's prestigious National School of Arts (ENA) in Havana at age 15. Originally pursuing classical guitar, she pivoted to the Renaissance lute (laud) after discovering her fingernails were too fragile for virtuoso guitar performance. However, singing ultimately became her primary focus, and she graduated from ENA with a solid choral background before joining the recognized female vocal group Ariés.

After Ariés disbanded, Niuver relocated to Spain to perform with a music and dance group, where she met a French engineer and fell in love. She subsequently moved to France, initially settling in Metz, where she became part of the city's jazz scene and collaborated with drummer Umberto Pagnini on his album *Donne latine*. In Paris, she reconnected with fellow Cuban musician Raúl Paz, who invited her to perform at his 2005 Paris Olympia concert and contributed songs and arrangements to her debut album. After years of production challenges, her first album was released in 2010. Her second album, *Trasnochando* (2012), was nominated at the Cubadisco International Music Fair in 2011. Her song "C'est toi que j'aime" received six months of airplay on France Inter and gained international exposure through placements in American television programs *Franklin and Bash* and *Whiskey Cavalier*. More recently, Niuver joined Guatemalan singer Ricardo Arjona's world tour as a singer and instrumentalist, which provided her an artist visa to relocate to the United States, ultimately settling in Miami where she achieved her long-held dream of living in America.

## Fun Facts
- Niuver's dreams of becoming a classical concert guitarist were derailed by fragile fingernails, leading her ENA teacher to suggest the Renaissance lute as an alternative—an instrument that connected her to the improvised oratorical jousts (*controversias*) of her rural Cuban childhood.
- She initially attempted to move to the United States to reunite with her sister, who had escaped Cuba when Niuver was four years old, but the political situation between the two countries prevented it; she ultimately achieved this dream decades later through her collaboration with Ricardo Arjona.
- Niuver's move to France was motivated by love—she fell in love with a French engineer while performing in Spain and relocated to France, where she learned the language and eventually became a French citizen.
- Her song "C'est toi que j'aime" received six months of continuous airplay on France Inter (a major French national radio station) and was featured in American television programs, marking a significant breakthrough in her international career.
