## Biography
Richard Rourke, originally from Massachusetts, moved to New Orleans in 2014, where he immersed himself in the city's vibrant music scene. He graduated from Loyola School of Music in 2018 and formed his band in 2017, establishing himself as a soulful singer-songwriter, pianist, and dynamic frontman blending **retro soul**, vintage soul, gritty funk, neo soul, R&B, and heartfelt storytelling that captures the spirit of New Orleans.[1][3][5] With 20 years of experience in piano, vocals, songwriting, and recording, Rourke has honed his skills through professional performances, gigs, and sessions in genres including indie, folk, and country.[3]

Rourke's career gained momentum with the breakout single 'Kick It With You,' an infectious groove that earned radio play, streaming success, and fan favor, marking a turning point in the modern soul-RnB scene. Follow-up releases like the introspective ballad 'Some Days'—blending 70s R&B and soul with a modern touch—'The Gettin Is Gone,' and 'Right On Cue' showcase his evolving sound, raw expressive vocals, and roots-driven style focused on themes of love, escape, and late-night clarity.[1][4] As keyboard player and backup vocalist for Hans Williams since 2021, he has contributed to over 18 million Spotify streams, four national tours, and major festivals like Bonnaroo, Hinterland, and Jazz Fest.[3]

Based in New Orleans, Louisiana, Rourke continues to light up stages locally and beyond, working full-time with his band while serving as a rhythm section player for other acts, from Grammy winners to local talent. His music resonates through honest narratives and emotional depth, solidified by his professional recording and live performance expertise.[1][3]
