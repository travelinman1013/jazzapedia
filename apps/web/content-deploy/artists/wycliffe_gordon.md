## Biography
Wycliffe A. Gordon, born on May 29, 1967, in Waynesboro, Georgia, grew up in a musical family influenced by his father, Lucius Gordon, a classical pianist, church organist, and teacher. He discovered the trombone at age 12 after his older brother began playing it and developed a passion for jazz at 13 through a collection of records inherited from his great-aunt, particularly drawn to Louis Armstrong and the Hot Five and Hot Seven recordings. Gordon attended Sego Junior High School and Butler High School in Augusta, Georgia, performed with the McDonald's All-American High School Band in 1984, and studied music education at Florida A&M University, playing in various ensembles including the marching band.[1][2][3][5]

Gordon's professional career launched after meeting Wynton Marsalis in 1987 during his sophomore year at Florida A&M, leading to his joining the Wynton Marsalis Septet from 1989 to 1995 and the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra as an original member from 1995 to 2000. He has released numerous recordings, including 13 solo albums with his quartet, composed extensively, and arranged the theme for NPR's 'All Things Considered,' heard daily worldwide. Known for his powerful sound, distinctive techniques, and funky style across genres like jazz, bebop, and christian jazz, Gordon has collaborated with artists such as Dizzy Gillespie, Paul Simon, and Branford Marsalis, and conducted premieres like his score for the 1925 silent film 'Body and Soul.'[1][2][3][4][5]

A committed educator, Gordon serves as Director of Jazz Studies at Augusta University (present), was Artist-in-Residence there from 2014-2018, Jazz Artist Resident at Arizona State University since 2019, and faculty at Manhattan School of Music's Jazz Arts Program. He has won Jazz Journalists Association Trombonist of the Year 13 times, DownBeat Best Trombone six times, and the ASCAP Foundation Vanguard Award in 2007, cementing his legacy as a world-renowned trombonist, composer, conductor, and music advocate.[1][2][3][8]
