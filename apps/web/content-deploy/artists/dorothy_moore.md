## Biography
Dorothy Moore, born October 13, 1946, in Jackson, Mississippi, began her musical journey as a child singing in the New Strangers Home Baptist Church Choir at age five, eventually becoming a soloist, and winning talent shows like those at the Alamo Theater from age 12. Raised by her great-grandmother who chaperoned her local performances, she was influenced by gospel artists such as Shirley Caesar and the Caravans, and later R&B icons like Aretha Franklin, Gladys Knight, and the Supremes; her father J.B. Mance sang with the gospel group Soul Consolators. After graduating from Lanier High School, she attended Jackson State University, where she formed the all-female vocal group the Poppies with Petsye McCune and Rosemary Taylor, signing to Epic Records' Date subsidiary in 1966, producing hits like 'Lullaby of Love' (No. 56 Billboard Hot 100).[1][3][5][6]

Transitioning to a solo career in 1976 with Malaco Records, Moore achieved massive success with soulful ballads including 'Misty Blue' (No. 1 R&B, No. 3 Pop), 'Funny How Time Slips Away' (No. 7 R&B), and 'I Believe You' (No. 5 R&B, No. 27 Pop, Grammy-nominated), earning her four Grammy nominations, Billboard awards, and NAACP Image Awards; her debut album Misty Blue charted for 23 weeks on Billboard's pop charts. She recorded five albums for Malaco before exploring gospel with Givin' It Straight to You (1986, No. 13 Billboard Gospel), Volt/Fantasy releases in 1988, and later her own Farish Street Records label from 2002, amassing over 16 albums with a style blending classic soul, R&B, blues harmonica (studied under L.C. Ulmer), and deep gospel roots.[2][3][5][6][7]

Moore's legacy endures as a Mississippi music ambassador, serving six years on the Blues Foundation board, chairing the Hart Fund, and receiving honors like the Governor’s Award for Excellence in the Arts, Mississippi Musicians Hall of Fame induction, and multiple Blues Music Awards; she toured internationally, appeared on Soul Train and American Bandstand, and remained active over 50 years, describing herself as an 'R&B singer with a blues heart.'[1][2][3]
