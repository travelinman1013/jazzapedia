## Biography
Terrence Orlando 'Terry' Callier (May 24, 1945 – October 27, 2012) was an American soul, folk, and jazz guitarist and singer-songwriter born on the North Side of Chicago and raised in the Cabrini-Green housing area. Growing up in a neighborhood that served as a creative hub, Callier was a childhood friend of Curtis Mayfield, Major Lance, and Jerry Butler, and began his musical journey singing in doo-wop groups during his teens. He learned piano early and later taught himself guitar while attending college, where he was influenced by the folk music explosion sweeping America. His musical education was eclectic, drawing from classical music, African and Middle Eastern ethnic music, and the jazz innovations of John Coltrane.

Callier's professional career began in 1962 with a Chess Records audition that produced his debut single 'Look at Me Now,' a northern soul classic. His breakthrough came with his 1965 debut album 'The New Folk Sound of Terry Callier' for Prestige Records, which showcased his innovative fusion of folk music with jazz influences and complex arrangements. Throughout the 1970s, he established himself as a prolific songwriter and recording artist, penning material for major acts including The Dells' 1972 hit 'The Love We Had Stays on My Mind' (co-written with Larry Wade) and contributing to Minnie Riperton's work. His three critically acclaimed albums for Cadet Records—'Occasional Rain' (1972), 'What Color Is Love' (1972), and 'I Just Can't Help Myself' (1973)—demonstrated his mastery of soul, jazz, funk, psychedelia, and classical influences, though they achieved limited commercial success.

After Chess Records was sold in 1976, Callier signed with Elektra Records' Jazz Fusion Division under Don Mizell, releasing 'Fire On Ice' (1977) and 'Turn You to Love' (1978). His only significant U.S. chart success came in 1979 when 'Sign Of The Times,' the opening track from 'Turn You to Love,' reached No. 78 on the R&B chart and became the theme tune for radio DJ Frankie Crocker. Despite limited commercial recognition during his lifetime, Callier toured with notable artists including George Benson and Gil Scott-Heron, and his sophisticated blend of genres and poetic social awareness established him as a singular artistic voice who influenced later generations of soul and jazz musicians.

## Fun Facts
- Callier and David Crosby lived together in an unfurnished Greenwich Village apartment in the early 1960s with several other musicians and women, with Crosby having the only bed while Callier slept on the floor—they met at the Bitter End, a new club on Bleecker Street that had previously been called the Cock 'N Bull.
- Callier would carry his guitar case whenever he went out, even when not planning to perform, specifically so people would know he was a musician and not assume he was someone commuting from Harlem, reflecting the racial dynamics of 1960s New York.
- Producer Samuel Charters mysteriously took the master tapes from Callier's 1962 Prestige Records sessions and ran off to Mexico, delaying the release of his debut album until 1965 and creating a gap in Callier's early recording history.
- Despite being a childhood friend of Curtis Mayfield, Major Lance, and Jerry Butler—all of whom achieved greater commercial success—Callier remained relatively unknown during his lifetime, though he was highly respected by musicians and critics for his sophisticated fusion of folk, jazz, soul, and psychedelic influences.
