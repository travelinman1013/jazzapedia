## Biography
Una Mae Carlisle (December 26, 1915 – November 7, 1956) was an American jazz singer, pianist, and songwriter born in Xenia, Ohio. She began performing as a child on radio station WHIO in Dayton, Ohio, and by her early teens ran away from home to pursue music in Cleveland, where she was influenced by Fats Waller. Discovered by Waller in Cincinnati around 1932 while still in her teens, she appeared on his radio program at age 13 and developed a piano style blending boogie-woogie, stride, swing, jazz, blues, and bebop, often incorporating humor. In 1934, she briefly worked as a showgirl at the Cotton Club in Harlem but quit due to the environment, later joining Lew Leslie's Blackbirds of 1936, which toured Europe and made her a star in London, Paris, Cairo, and beyond.[1][2][5][7]
