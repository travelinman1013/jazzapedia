## Biography
Gene Krupa (January 15, 1909 – October 16, 1973) was an American jazz drummer, bandleader, and composer who revolutionized drumming in jazz and became one of the most influential percussionists of the swing era.[4] Born in Chicago as the youngest of nine children, Krupa studied with renowned teachers Sanford A. Moeller and Roy Knapp, and began playing drums professionally in the mid-1920s.[4] He made his first recordings in 1927 with the McKenzie-Condon Chicagoans, becoming the first drummer to use a full kit on a recording—a significant technological achievement at a time when bass drums could damage recording equipment.[5] His early influences included drummers Tubby Hall, Zutty Singleton, and Baby Dodds, and he performed in pit orchestras for George Gershwin Broadway musicals alongside future collaborators Benny Goodman and Glenn Miller.

Krupa achieved international fame after joining Benny Goodman's orchestra in December 1934, where he was prominently featured in both the full orchestra and the groundbreaking Goodman Trio and Quartet—possibly the first working small group to feature black and white musicians together.[3] His classic performance on "Sing Sing Sing" at Carnegie Hall on January 16, 1938, is heralded as the first extended drum solo in jazz.[3] Tensions arose as audiences demanded Krupa be featured in every number, leading him to depart in March 1938 and form his own orchestra, which debuted at the Steel Pier in Atlantic City in April 1938 to immediate success.[1][3] The Gene Krupa Orchestra went through several incarnations, featuring vocalists Anita O'Day and Roy Eldridge (added in 1941), and later incorporating string sections and bebop arrangements.[2][3] In 1943, Krupa was arrested on a marijuana charge, resulting in a brief jail sentence and the temporary breakup of his orchestra; he subsequently rejoined Goodman and Tommy Dorsey before reforming his band.[4]

By the 1950s, as swing orchestras declined due to television, changing musical tastes, and competition from bebop and rhythm and blues, Krupa reluctantly disbanded his orchestra in 1951.[2] He transitioned to leading smaller ensembles—trios and quartets—often featuring tenor saxophonist Charlie Ventura and pianist Teddy Napoleon, recording popular versions of standards like "Dark Eyes" and "Body and Soul."[2] In his later years, Krupa co-founded a drummers school with Cozy Cole, gave anti-drug lectures beginning in 1969, and continued performing despite health challenges including back problems and a 1960 heart attack.[3] His last commercial recording was in November 1972 with Eddie Condon and Wild Bill Davison.[3] Gene Krupa's legacy as a pioneering drummer, bandleader, and educator profoundly influenced jazz percussion and established the drums as a solo instrument in jazz.

## Fun Facts
- In 1927, Gene Krupa became the first drummer to use a full drum kit on a recording—a technological breakthrough because the pounding of a bass drum could easily dislocate the stylus on recording equipment.[5]
- During rehearsals for George Gershwin's Broadway play "Strike Up the Band" in 1929, Krupa had never learned to read music and "faked" his parts during rehearsals until Glenn Miller assisted him by humming the drum parts until he got them down.[3]
- Krupa's classic drum solo on "Sing Sing Sing" at Carnegie Hall on January 16, 1938, is heralded as the first extended drum solo in jazz, establishing the drums as a solo instrument in the genre.[3]
- In 1944, Krupa's orchestra featured 27 musicians including a ten-piece string section and a second drummer (Joe Dale) who filled in when Krupa conducted the band, which was billed as "The Band That Swings With Strings."[2]
