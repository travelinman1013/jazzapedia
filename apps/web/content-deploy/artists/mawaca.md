## Biography
Mawaca is a Brazilian musical group from São Paulo, founded in the early 1990s by Kitty Pereira and Magda Pucci as a collective for studying and experimenting with global music traditions. It became professionally established in 1995 with debut shows at Teatro Hall and Teatro Paulista, performing 'Dos Cantos Pigmeus às Canções Escocesas.' Under the musical direction of Magda Pucci, who has led the group since 1992, Mawaca researches and reinterprets songs from diverse cultures worldwide in original arrangements, singing in over 20 languages with a lineup of seven singers and six instrumentalists. Their style blends these traditions with Brazilian music elements, emphasizing vocal harmonies and cross-cultural connections.[2][1][4]

The group's career highlights include international tours starting in 2002 in Spain (Etnosur Festival, WOMEX), performances at Rock in Rio in 2001 alongside world music artists, and multiple visits to Bolivia from 2007-2010. They have released eight albums, including 'astrolabiotucupira.com.brasil' (2000) featuring the first indigenous song 'Koi Txangaré' from the Paiter Suruí, and 'Rupestres Sonoros' (2010s). In 2010, Mawaca toured the Brazilian Amazon for musical exchanges with indigenous communities like Paiter Suruí, Ikolen-Gavião, Karitiana, Huni-Kuin, Kambeba, and Bayaroá, documented in a film. Projects like 'Inquilinos do Mundo' (2012 CD/DVD) focus on music of nomads, refugees, and exiles. Awards include two PPM prizes (2016, 2019) and best performance at World Leisure Expo in China (2012).[2][1][6]

Mawaca's legacy lies in ethnomusicological research and performance, bridging indigenous, global folk, and contemporary stages while promoting cultural exchange. Magda Pucci's 23+ years as director have shaped their focus on respectful reinterpretation, as explored in her academic thesis on indigenous music collaborations.[1][5]
