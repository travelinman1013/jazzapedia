## Biography
Teena Marie, born Mary Christine Brockert on March 5, 1956, in Santa Monica, California, grew up in a musically inclined environment and attended Venice High School, where she participated in the Summer Dance Production and a school production of The Music Man. She briefly worked at Pup 'n' Taco in the mid-1970s before signing with Motown Records in 1976 after auditioning for Berry Gordy. Spotted by Rick James, who became her mentor, she debuted in 1979 with the Rick James-produced album Wild and Peaceful, featuring the hit 'I'm a Sucker for Your Love.' Her early career blended quiet storm and post-disco styles, marked by her soulful voice and multi-instrumental talents as a singer-songwriter-producer.[1][2][6]

Marie achieved breakthroughs with albums like Irons in the Fire (1980), where she handled all writing and production, yielding 'I Need Your Lovin',' and It Must Be Magic (1981), her first gold record with the hit 'Square Biz.' After leaving Motown in 1982 amid a dispute that led to the landmark Brockert Initiative (protecting artists from label holdouts), she joined Epic Records, releasing hits like 'Lovergirl' (#4 Pop) from Starchild (1984) and 'Ooo La La La' (#1 R&B) from Naked to the World (1988). She took a hiatus in the 1990s to raise her daughter Alia Rose, returning with La Doña (2004) on Cash Money, earning a Grammy nomination, followed by Sapphire (2006) and Congo Square (2009).[1][2][3]

Known as the Ivory Queen of Soul or Lady T, Marie's legacy includes pushing soul into eclectic directions with funk, rock, and rap elements, selling over 2.5 million albums in the SoundScan era. She passed away on December 26, 2010, at age 54, leaving a profound impact praised by Berry Gordy for her soulful depth.[2][3][4]
