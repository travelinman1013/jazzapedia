## Biography
Jonathan Michael Batiste, born November 11, 1986, in Metairie, Louisiana, grew up immersed in New Orleans' rich musical heritage, influenced by jazz, funk, and rhythm and blues. He attended St. Augustine High School and the New Orleans Center for Creative Arts, graduating in 2004, before studying jazz at the Juilliard School, where he earned a Bachelor of Music in 2008 and a Master of Music in 2011 under teacher William Daghlian. At age 17, he released his debut instrumental album *Times in New Orleans* in 2005, followed by performances across Europe and the U.S., including his Carnegie Hall debut in 2007 with young Dutch musicians.[1][3]

Batiste's career gained prominence when he formed the band Stay Human in 2005 with Juilliard peers bassist Phil Kuehn, drummer Joe Saylor, saxophonist Eddie Barbash, and tuba player Ibanda Ruhumbika; their debut EP *My N.Y.* was recorded busking in New York subways in 2011. From 2015 to 2022, he served as bandleader and musical director for *The Late Show with Stephen Colbert*, blending genres nightly. His 2021 album *We Are* earned a record 11 Grammy nominations, winning five including Album of the Year; in 2025, he released *Big Money*, featuring collaborations across blues, R&B, and rock. Batiste composed for Carnegie Hall's *American Symphony* (2023), documented in a Netflix film.[1][2][3]

Known for his genre-defying style rooted in New Orleans traditions yet incorporating modern elements, Batiste advocates for music education as a Music Unites ambassador, co-artistic director of the National Jazz Museum in Harlem, and Juilliard board member since 2022. A civil rights supporter, he has organized protests and backed initiatives like the Equal Justice Initiative.[1][3]
