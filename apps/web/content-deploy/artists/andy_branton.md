## Biography
Andy Branton is a Louisville, Kentucky-based Americana solo artist, singer, songwriter, sideman, and multi-instrumentalist originally from the Tuscaloosa, Alabama area. He developed his skills playing guitar in country and rock & roll bands around the West Alabama bar scene, collecting stories and songs during travels along Alabama’s highways and dirt roads. This foundation led to the release of his debut EP *47 Minutes Away*, recorded in a single 8-hour session with a team of Birmingham, Alabama’s top musicians.[1]

The EP *47 Minutes Away* showcases Branton's musical style, blending country-rock, blues, and Americana elements. Tracks like the up-tempo title song reference coming home to Little Rock, Arkansas, featuring pedal steel by Ford Boswell of Early James & the Latest and piano/harmonica by Daniel Raine of Little Raine Band. Other songs, such as *Younger Man* with its greasy electric guitar and cautionary tale lyrics, *Time to Go* predicting his move north on I-65, and the groovy *Lands in Birmingham* about long-distance love, highlight his storytelling and versatile sound. Now based in Louisville, Branton continues touring the country, writing, singing, and performing.[1]

While still emerging with modest popularity, Branton's career reflects a sideman-to-solo evolution rooted in Southern music scenes, with no extensive legacy documented yet beyond his debut and ongoing road work.[1]
