## Biography
John Michael Bradford is a trumpeter, singer, bandleader, composer, arranger, and educator from New Orleans, Louisiana, whose musical passion was ignited during the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. At eight years old, he evacuated the city with his family and stayed with family friend and trombonist Sam Williams of Big Sam’s Funky Nation, where he fell in love with music and decided to pursue it as a career. He became a dedicated trumpet student, mentored by New Orleans legends like Donald Harrison and Nicholas Payton, before studying Performance at Berklee College of Music under Sean Jones and Tia Fuller. There, he recorded his debut album 'Something Old, Something New,' featuring New Orleans artists such as Chris Severin, Donald Harrison, Joe Dyson, Rickie Monie, Benny Jones, Sam Williams, and Detroit Brooks, which earned a nomination for Best Contemporary Jazz Album by OffBeat Magazine in 2017.[1]

Bradford's career blends jazz, funk, blues, hip-hop, soul, and New Orleans traditional music, drawing deeply from Black American Music traditions. He has performed professionally with luminaries including Jon Batiste, Herbie Hancock, Leo Nocentelli, Leslie Odom Jr., Harry Connick Jr., and Dumpstaphunk, and recorded with Donald Harrison, Sam Williams, Rickie Monie of Preservation Hall, and Leo Nocentelli of The Meters. His performances have headlined global venues like The World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and The Grammy Awards in Los Angeles. Now based in Los Angeles after returning to New Orleans, he is pursuing a Masters in Performance of Black American Music at Tulane University while teaching at The New Orleans Center for Creative Arts and The New Orleans Jazz and Heritage School, mentoring the next generation.[1][4]

His work pays homage to his hometown's spirit, channeling influences into original compositions and arrangements that traverse genres while remaining rooted in New Orleans identity. Bradford's legacy lies in preserving and evolving these traditions through performance, education, and community contribution.[1]
