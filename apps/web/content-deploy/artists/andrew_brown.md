## Biography
Andrew Brown, born on February 25, 1937, in Jackson, Mississippi, discovered his guitar talent at a young age and began jamming with local musicians, including Joe Dyson's big band and even Charlie Parker before leaving for Chicago. In Chicago, he immersed himself in the West Side blues scene, playing with contemporaries like Magic Sam and Freddie King, while also backing soul singer Denise LaSalle and working in Baby Face Willette’s organ combo. His career was interrupted by Army service, after which he settled in Harvey, Illinois, working in a steel mill while sporadically performing and recording singles like 'You Better Stop' in 1962 and 'You Ought To Be Ashamed' for Four Brothers label.[1][2][3]

Brown's versatile style blended blues, soul, jazz, gospel, and ballads, influenced by artists like the Kings, Bobby Bland, Little Milton, and Tyrone Davis, which he absorbed into his robust voice and fluid guitar lines reminiscent of B.B. King and Lowell Fulson. He played multiple instruments including organ and alto sax, gigging in Chicago suburbs, roadhouses, and jazz clubs. Health setbacks in the 1970s—a heart attack and back injury from mill work—pushed him back to music full-time, leading to his North Side debut and recordings for Alligator’s Living Chicago Blues series in 1979, followed by albums Big Brown’s Chicago Blues (1981) and On The Case (1983).[1][2]

Despite late recognition, including a European following, Brown died of cancer on December 11, 1985, at age 48, just as his talent was gaining acclaim. Known as 'Big Brown' for his physique and sound, he remained a journeyman bluesman, celebrated posthumously for his classy, understated electric blues.[1][2][3]
