## Biography
Gerard “Bo Dollis Jr.” Dollis grew up in New Orleans immersed in Mardi Gras Indian culture, watching his father, Big Chief Bo Dollis Sr., lead the Wild Magnolias tribe. Surrounded by music, handcrafted suits, and deep-rooted traditions from his Uptown neighborhood near the Magnolia Housing Projects, Bo Jr. was shaped by this heritage from a young age. He began masking and performing with the tribe early on, taking on the title of Big Chief in 2006 and assuming full leadership in 2012 at his father's request, before Bo Sr.'s passing in 2015.[2][3][4][6]

As Big Chief, Bo Dollis Jr. has perpetuated and evolved the Wild Magnolias' sound, blending traditional Mardi Gras Indian call-and-response chants with funk, soul, and R&B influences pioneered by his father. He led the tribe on albums including *A New Kind of Funk* (2013), *My Name is Bo* (2021)—named one of the top ten best Louisiana music albums by OffBeat Magazine—and *Chip Off the Old Block* (2025). Bo Jr. continues to perform nationally and locally, including at events like Bayou Boogaloo, while running a barber shop at Louisiana Avenue and Baronne Street.[3][4][5]

Beyond music, Bo Dollis Jr. serves as a cultural educator, advocating for New Orleans traditions amid gentrification and climate change. He engages in discussions, such as those hosted by the Harvard Radcliffe Institute, emphasizing cultural resilience. His leadership ensures the Mardi Gras Indian legacy endures for future generations.[4]
