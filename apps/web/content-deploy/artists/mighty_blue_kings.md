## Biography
The Mighty Blue Kings are a Chicago-based band formed in 1995 during the 1990s swing revival, led by vocalist Ross Bon. Emerging amid the lounge music craze alongside acts like Squirrel Nut Zippers and Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, the group consisted of talented Chicago musicians who began playing in local clubs before securing a house band residency at the legendary Green Mill Cocktail Lounge. They toured the Midwest and West Coast, formed their own label R-Jay Records, and released their debut album 'Meet Me In Uptown' in 1997, followed by 'Come One, Come All' on Sony's Work Records the same year.[1][2][4]

The band's career gained momentum with their 1998 live album 'Live In Chicago,' capturing their energetic performances, and appearances on movie soundtracks like 'Kissing A Fool' and 'Three To Tango' featuring Ross Bon. Known for blending swing, jump blues, boogie-woogie, jazz, and R&B—described as 'sometimes dirty, sometimes martini-smooth'—they broke the Billboard Top Ten Blues Chart, released five independent records, and performed at major venues like the Aragon Ballroom.[1][2][3][4][5]

Celebrating 25 years by around 2020, Ross Bon and the Mighty Blue Kings returned to the Green Mill for residencies, maintaining their legacy in Chicago's music scene with high-energy shows that evoke the swing era's swagger and bravado. Members have rotated over time, with current lineup including Ernie Adams on drums, Matt Thompson on bass, Scott Tipping on guitar, and Jerry DeVivo on saxophone.[3][4][5]
