## Biography
Durand Jones, born July 22, 1988, in Hillaryville, Louisiana, was immersed in gospel music from an early age before attending Southeastern Louisiana University on a saxophone scholarship, studying classical music and jazz. He later moved to Bloomington, Indiana, to join the IU Soul Revue, a collegiate ensemble preserving Black popular music styles like soul, funk, and R&B, where he met key collaborators Aaron Frazer and Blake Rhein. This serendipitous encounter in 2012 led to the formation of Durand Jones & The Indications, initially as a recording project using a Tascam four-track recorder, blending retro soul sounds reminiscent of the 1960s and 1970s with modern sensibilities.[1][2][4]

The band's self-titled debut album emerged from those early sessions, first released in 2016 by Colemine Records and reissued in 2018 by Dead Oceans, catapulting them into the soul revivalist movement amid critical acclaim from outlets like NPR, Rolling Stone, and Pitchfork. Subsequent albums *American Love Call* (2019), *Private Space* (2021), and *Flowers* (2025) showcased evolving styles, from vocal group harmonies and big string arrangements to disco-infused modern soul, recorded in locations like Brooklyn and upstate New York. Despite initial sparse live performances and members pursuing separate careers, reunions fueled by fan and critic support led to extensive touring across the US, Europe, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand, solidifying their reputation for energetic shows and dual lead vocals.[1][3][5]

Under the guidance of IU Soul Revue director Tyron Cooper, who emphasized soul's core elements—love songs, social consciousness, and party tracks—the band has maintained a gritty funk and Southern soul foundation. Their legacy endures as a bridge between vintage revivalism and contemporary R&B, beloved by lowrider communities, vintage music fans, and late-night TV audiences, with a sound that continues to innovate while honoring its roots.[3][4]
