## Biography
Louis Armstrong (August 4, 1901 – July 6, 1971), nicknamed "Satchmo," "Satch," and "Pops," was born in New Orleans, Louisiana and became the most significant jazzman in the history of the music.[1] After being arrested on New Year's Eve 1912, Armstrong was sent to the Colored Waif's Home for Boys, where he learned to play the cornet under Peter Davis's tutelage and eventually became leader of the Waif's Home Brass Band.[2] Released in 1914, he was mentored by the city's top cornetist, Joe "King" Oliver, and quickly became one of the most in-demand cornetists in New Orleans, working steadily on Mississippi riverboats and with various ensembles.[2]

In 1922, King Oliver invited Armstrong to join his Creole Jazz Band in Chicago, marking Armstrong's transition to full-time professional musicianship.[7] Armstrong and Oliver became renowned for their intricate two-cornet breaks, and they began recording together in 1923.[2] During this period, Armstrong married Lillian Hardin, the band's pianist, who encouraged him to pursue a solo career.[2] After a year in New York with Fletcher Henderson's Orchestra in 1924, Armstrong returned to Chicago in 1925 and began recording under his own name for the first time, creating his most important early works with the Hot Five and Hot Seven recordings (1925–1928), through which he emerged as the first great jazz soloist.[7]

From the late 1920s onward, Armstrong worked as both sideman and bandleader in formats ranging from small combos to big bands.[6] In 1947, as big band popularity waned, Armstrong's manager Joe Glaser transformed his ensemble into a six-piece traditional jazz group called Louis Armstrong and His All Stars, which remained his primary performing vehicle for the rest of his career.[2][4] Armstrong's international tours made him so popular that he was dubbed "Ambassador Satch," and he became a dominant influence on the swing era, with most trumpeters attempting to emulate his dramatic structure, melody, and technical virtuosity.[2][7]
