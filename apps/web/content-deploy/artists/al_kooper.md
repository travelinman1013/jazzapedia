## Biography
Al Kooper (born Alan Peter Kuperschmidt on February 5, 1944) is an American songwriter, record producer, and musician who became one of rock music's most prolific and influential studio musicians throughout the 1960s and 1970s. He began his professional music career at age 14 as a guitarist with The Royal Teens, whose 1958 novelty song "Short Shorts" reached the Top 5 on the Hot 100 chart. By age 21, Kooper had moved to Greenwich Village in Manhattan and co-written "This Diamond Ring" with Bob Brass and Irwin Levine, which became a chart-topping hit for Gary Lewis and the Playboys in 1965. His breakthrough moment came that same year when producer Tom Wilson invited him to observe a Bob Dylan recording session; Kooper spontaneously played the signature organ riff on Dylan's "Like a Rolling Stone," a performance that would become iconic in rock history.

Kooper's career flourished through his involvement with two seminal bands that defined the sound of 1960s rock. He joined The Blues Project in 1965 as their keyboardist, helping the group spearhead the urban blues sound with critically acclaimed records and live performances at venues like the Fillmore in San Francisco. However, creative differences—specifically his desire to incorporate horn arrangements into the band's sound—led him to leave in spring 1967, shortly before their legendary Monterey International Pop Festival performance. He then founded Blood, Sweat & Tears in 1967, releasing the inventive album "Child Is Father to the Man," which showcased his soulful keyboards and earthy vocals. Beyond his work as a performer, Kooper established himself as a visionary record producer, discovering Lynyrd Skynyrd in Atlanta in 1972 and producing their first three albums, which yielded massive hits including "Sweet Home Alabama," "Saturday Night Special," and "Free Bird." His production work extended to artists including The Tubes and demonstrated his ability to identify and nurture emerging talent across multiple genres.

## Fun Facts
- At age 14, Kooper joined The Royal Teens and became a professional musician, though he did not actually play on their famous 1958 hit 'Short Shorts'—the recording featured other musicians.
- During the Bob Dylan 'Like a Rolling Stone' session in 1965, Kooper was essentially a bystander who invited himself to participate; upon hearing Mike Bloomfield's guitar warm-up, he realized he couldn't compete as a guitarist and instead switched to organ, creating one of rock's most iconic instrumental parts.
- Kooper experienced what he described as 'a nervous breakdown' that led him to leave The Blues Project in spring 1967, just before their legendary Monterey International Pop Festival performance—though he did perform a solo set at the festival.
- His discovery of Lynyrd Skynyrd in Atlanta in 1972 at a favorite hangout led him to form his own record label, Sounds of the South, specifically to release their records, demonstrating his commitment to nurturing emerging talent.
