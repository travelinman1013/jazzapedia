## Biography
Johnny Griffin and Eddie 'Lockjaw' Davis were two prominent American jazz tenor saxophonists who formed a celebrated tenor battle partnership in the early 1960s, co-leading a quintet renowned for its hard-driving hard bop and bebop style. Eddie Davis, born Edward F. Davis on March 2, 1922, in New York City, began his career in the late 1930s at Clark Monroe's Uptown House, rooted in swing and blues with influences from Texas tenors. He played with big bands led by Cootie Williams, Lucky Millinder, Andy Kirk, and Louis Armstrong, formed his own group Eddie Davis and His Beboppers in 1946 featuring Fats Navarro and others, and pioneered the tenor sax/Hammond organ combo from 1955-1960 with Shirley Scott. Johnny Griffin, from Chicago, nicknamed 'the Little Giant' for his short stature and powerful sound, emerged in the mid-1940s as a hard bop pioneer, recording with Thelonious Monk and Art Blakey before partnering with Davis.[1][2][3][4][5]

From 1960 to 1962, Griffin and Davis led a quintet often featuring pianist Junior Mance, releasing albums like Tough Tenors, Battle Stations, and Blues Up and Down on labels such as Jazzland and Prestige, showcasing their contrasting styles—Davis's full-bodied, reedy tone blending swing, R&B, and soul jazz with Griffin's rapid, forceful bop lines. They continued collaborating in the mid-1960s with the Kenny Clarke/Francy Boland Big Band in Europe and made sporadic recordings into the 1970s. Davis also had multiple stints with Count Basie from 1952 through the 1970s, solidifying his link from big band era to soul jazz. Davis passed away on November 3, 1986, in Culver City, California, from Hodgkin's lymphoma.[1][2][3][4][5][6]

Their partnership produced some of the finest two-tenor recordings, emphasizing rock-solid bop at their peaks, with Griffin's speed complementing Davis's singing, direct quality. This duo influenced subsequent saxophonists through their exciting, tasteful interplay, bridging bebop, hard bop, and soul jazz while maintaining blues roots.
