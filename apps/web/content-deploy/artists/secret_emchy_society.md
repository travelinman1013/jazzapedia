## Biography
Cindy Emch, known professionally as Emchy, was born and raised in Michigan with rural influences and an early introduction to music through her mother, who played standards on the accordion. She developed a love for Leonard Cohen and Tom Waits in her youth, but it was a college radio show that introduced her to alternative country artists like Dwight Yoakam, Johnny Cash, and Lucinda Williams, reshaping her musical tastes away from traditional country she once avoided. Moving to the Bay Area in 1995, Emch co-founded punk-country bands Vagabondage and Rhubarb Whiskey, honing her skills as a side player while working day jobs and DJing, including hosting Emchy's Outlaw Americana on Gimme Country radio.[1][2][5]

In 2015, a pivotal moment occurred at a Sonoma show when Emch unexpectedly took the stage as bandleader for the first time, transposing her accordion songs to guitar on the fly, which led to the formation of The Secret Emchy Society, her Oakland-based ensemble blending queer country, gritty Americana, rootsy punk, and honky-tonk. This marked her transition from ensemble member to frontwoman and full-time touring musician. She founded and edited Country Queer magazine, produced events like the 2021 National Queer Arts Festival Showcase, and contributes a 'Queer Cuts' column to Strange Fire Magazine, championing queer voices in country music. Nominated multiple times for Best Local LGBT Band by the Bay Area Reporter, her debut album *The Stars Fall Shooting Into Twangsville* (2017) and others like *Gold Country/Country Gold* showcase her raw, heartfelt songwriting compared to legends like Ray Davies and Cowboy Jack Clement.[1][2][3][4][9]

Emch's style emphasizes inclusivity at the 'intersection of shit-kickery and tenderness,' rejecting gatekeeping in country music while drawing from diverse influences including post-punk bands like X and Black Flag. Her career reflects a philosophy of seizing opportunities, evolving from a music enthusiast with a day job to a key figure in the burgeoning queer country scene, touring extensively and collaborating across genres.[1][5][6]

## Fun Facts
- Emch's first stage-leading gig in 2015 was a scramble: she threw together a setlist and transposed accordion songs to guitar on the spot after a last-minute bandleader switch, birthing The Secret Emchy Society.[1]
- 'Sorrows Drowned' was accidentally recorded in one take on accordion by Emch grabbing Grayson Walker's instrument during a break at the end of marathon sessions.[3]
- A 'grizzled and gorgeous' old woman in a haunted New Orleans bar told Emch to 'shake your ass,' inspiring her to quit overtime burnout and pursue music full-time, kicking off her debut album.[3]
- Emch once hosted a radio show that gave her the first country music she felt was 'for her'—not from people who 'would want to kick my ass.'[1]
