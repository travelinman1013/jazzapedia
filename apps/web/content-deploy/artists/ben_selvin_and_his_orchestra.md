## Biography
Benjamin Bernard Selvin (March 5, 1898 – July 15, 1980), born in New York City to Russian-Jewish immigrant parents, began playing violin before age seven and studied to become a concert violinist. He started his professional career at 15 as a fiddle player in New York City nightclubs, appearing on Broadway in 1913 and performing at venues like Rector’s, Reisenweber’s, and Healy’s. At 19, he organized his own orchestra, leading the Novelty Orchestra and achieving massive success with 'Dardanella' in 1919, which sold over 5 million copies and became the biggest-selling popular song in the first quarter-century of recorded music.[1][2][3]

- He recorded the same song up to six times in a day with different arrangers to fulfill contracts across multiple labels.[4]
- Selvin played a key role in developing Muzak in the 1930s as Vice President of programming and helped 3M transition from vinyl to audio cassettes post-retirement.[2][3]
