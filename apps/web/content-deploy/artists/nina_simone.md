## Biography
Nina Simone was born Eunice Kathleen Waymon on February 21, 1933, in Tryon, North Carolina, into a musically rich household where her mother, Mary Kate Irvin, was a Methodist preacher and her father, John Divine Waymon, worked as an entertainer, barber, and dry-cleaner.[2] A prodigious talent, Simone began playing piano at age three and was performing as the regular pianist at her family's church by age six.[2][4] Her early classical training was made possible through the generosity of family friends and benefactors who recognized her exceptional promise; she specialized in the works of Johann Sebastian Bach and other classical composers.[2] After graduating as valedictorian from Allen High School for Girls in Asheville, North Carolina in 1950, she earned a scholarship to the Juilliard School in New York City, where she studied classical piano while working as an accompanist and piano teacher to support herself.[2] Her aspirations to become a concert pianist were profoundly shaped by her rejection from the prestigious Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, which she believed was based solely on her race—an injustice that would deeply influence her later activism and worldview.[1][2]

When financial constraints forced her to leave formal music education, Simone began performing in nightclubs and bars to support herself. In 1954, she adopted the stage name "Nina" (Spanish for "little one," a nickname from a former boyfriend) and "Simone" (after French actress Simone Signoret) to conceal her bar work from her conservative Methodist minister mother.[2][4] Her vocal career began unexpectedly when a club owner at the Midtown Bar and Grill in Atlantic City, New Jersey, threatened to fire her unless she sang in addition to playing piano.[5] After receiving rave reviews for her performances in Atlantic City and Philadelphia supper clubs, she was signed by Bethlehem Records at age twenty-four and released her debut album, *Little Girl Blue*, in 1958.[2][6] Her distinctive rendition of "I Loves You, Porgy" from *Porgy and Bess* became a Top 20 hit in 1959, launching her career as a recording artist.[1][2]

Throughout her career, Nina Simone became known as "The High Priestess of Soul," blending classical training with jazz, blues, folk, and soul music to create a uniquely powerful artistic voice.[2] Beyond her musical achievements, she became a prominent civil rights activist, using her platform to address racial injustice and inequality. Her life was marked by both tremendous artistic accomplishment and personal struggle, including periods of exile in Liberia, Switzerland, and France, where she continued recording and performing until her death in 2003.[4]

## Fun Facts
- At age twelve, Simone experienced a formative moment of racial injustice when she performed a piano recital at a library where her parents were forced to stand in the back because they were Black, making her acutely sensitive to racism from an early age.[5]
- Simone adopted her stage name to hide her nightclub work from her mother, a strict Methodist minister who disapproved of secular music and bar employment; she chose 'Nina' from a former boyfriend's nickname and 'Simone' after French actress Simone Signoret.[2][4]
- Her vocal career began almost by accident in 1954 when the owner of the Midtown Bar and Grill in Atlantic City threatened to fire her unless she sang in addition to playing piano, launching what would become her signature dual talent.[5]
- Despite her tremendous success as a jazz and soul artist, Simone always harbored a deep desire to be recognized as a classical concert pianist, using proceeds from her early album sales to fund continued classical training.[2]
