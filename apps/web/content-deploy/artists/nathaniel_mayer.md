## Biography
Nathaniel Mayer was born on February 10, 1944, in Detroit, Michigan, where he grew up immersed in music, learning gospel singing in church as a child and idolizing Sam Cooke and the Soul Stirrers. Surrounded by a musical family, he began writing songs early, contacting Fortune Records at age 12 and receiving guidance from Joe Weaver, who helped structure his compositions into proper songs. Mayer performed at high school sock hops and made his debut at DJ Ernie Durham’s record hop in 1959, signing with Fortune soon after to release his first single, 'My Last Dance With You' b/w 'My Little Darling,' at age 16.[1][2][4]

## Fun Facts
- Mayer wrote 'I Want Love And Affection (Not The House Of Correction)' while in jail in 1963, updating the year from the Robins' 'Riot In Cell Block #9' with fellow inmate Timmy Shaw.[1]
- He earned the nickname 'Nay Dog' from his habit of picking up women at his shows, later using it for his 1980 single 'Raise The Curtain High'.[1]
- His 1962 hit 'Village of Love' was the biggest ever recorded at Fortune Studio, reaching Billboard top 40, but poor distribution overshadowed it amid Motown's dominance.[1][2]
- After decades away, Mayer made a comeback with Fat Possum Records around 2000, releasing his first full-length album nearly 40 years after starting.[2]
