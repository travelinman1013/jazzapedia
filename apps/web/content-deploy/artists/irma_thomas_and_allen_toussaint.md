# Irma Thomas & Allen Toussaint

## Biography
Irma Thomas, born Irma Lee on February 18, 1941, in Ponchatoula, Louisiana, and raised in New Orleans, began her musical journey singing in the Mission Baptist Church choir as a teenager, performing at school talent shows and dances. Her breakthrough came in 1959 at age 18 while working as a waitress at the Pimlico Club, where she sang with bandleader Tommy Ridgley against her boss's wishes, leading to her firing but also a recording contract with Ron Records. Her debut single, 'You Can Have My Husband, But Please Don’t Mess With My Man,' reached #22 on the Billboard R&B charts in 1960. Dissatisfied with royalties, she joined Minit Records, recruited by Allen Toussaint, who wrote and produced hits like 'It’s Raining' and 'Ruler of My Heart' tailored to her powerful, emotive voice blending soul, R&B, and New Orleans rhythms.[2][4][5]

In 1963, Imperial Records acquired Minit, yielding Thomas's biggest hit, 'Wish Someone Would Care' (#17 on Billboard pop charts in 1964), alongside tracks like 'Breakaway' and 'Time Is On My Side' (later a Rolling Stones hit). She released nine singles and two albums with Imperial while touring the Southern college circuit. After Hurricane Camille in 1969, she relocated to California, working day jobs in retail and auto parts while gigging weekends and recording for labels like Atlantic. Returning to New Orleans in the mid-1970s, she sustained a strong live presence. Her recording comeback began in 1986 with Rounder Records' 'The New Rules,' produced by Scott Billington, earning Grammy nominations in 1991 and 1998, and a win in 2007 for 'After the Rain' post-Hurricane Katrina.[2][3][6]

Known as the 'Soul Queen of New Orleans,' Thomas's style fuses blues, soul, gospel, and Cajun elements, reflecting her roots. She married manager Emile Jackson in 1977; they ran the Lion’s Den nightclub until Katrina destroyed it in 2005. With seven children and over six decades performing, her enduring legacy includes influencing New Orleans music and appearing in documentaries like 'Make It Funky!' performing with Toussaint.[4][5]

## Fun Facts
- Allen Toussaint often wrote songs with Irma Thomas's voice 'in his head,' even hiring her for Minit after initially turning her down at an audition when she was 17.
- By age 19, Thomas had been married twice and had four children while launching her career.
- She was fired from her waitressing job for singing with Tommy Ridgley's band instead of serving tables, which led directly to her first record deal.
- Post-Katrina, her album 'After the Rain' won a Grammy for Best Contemporary Blues Album in 2007, marking a triumphant return.
