## Biography
Trampled By Turtles is an American band formed in Duluth, Minnesota, in 2003 as a side project by frontman Dave Simonett, who had lost most of his musical gear to thieves while playing with his previous rock band, leaving him with only an acoustic guitar. Previously involved in rock music, Simonett and his bandmates—Tim Saxhaug on bass, Dave Carroll on banjo, Erik Berry on mandolin, and Ryan Young on fiddle (who had drummed in a speed metal band)—turned to bluegrass, folk, and Americana styles without prior experience in the genre, creating a fast, frenetic sound blending rock energy with acoustic instrumentation.[1][2][3][4] Their debut album, *Songs from a Ghost Town* (2004), introduced this innovative approach, bridging traditional bluegrass with contemporary rock influences, followed by *Blue Sky and the Devil* (2005) and *Trouble* (2007).[2]

Breakthrough came with *Duluth* (2008), earning bluegrass community recognition and building momentum described as gaining 'traction.' Subsequent releases like *Palomino* (2010) and *Stars and Satellites* (2012) propelled them to mainstream success, charting on the Billboard 200 and appearing at festivals such as Coachella, Lollapalooza, and ACL Fest, alongside TV spots on *The Late Show with David Letterman* and *A Prairie Home Companion*. Albums including *Live at First Avenue* (2013), *Wild Animals* (2014), and *Alpenglow* (2022, produced by Jeff Tweedy of Wilco) showcased evolution from high-octane 'thrash bluegrass' to more thoughtful, balanced roots music, with periods of hiatus like during the 2020 COVID pandemic prompting reevaluation.[2][5][6][7]

Known for their DIY aesthetic, relentless touring with acts like Wilco, Lord Huron, and Deer Tick, and redefining bluegrass by pushing tempos and incorporating rock elements, Trampled By Turtles has built an international following while maintaining an organic, unforced growth over two decades.[1][3][6]

## Fun Facts
- The band name 'Trampled By Turtles' was chosen as something 'neither predictable nor logical' when the Duluth musicians swapped rock for bluegrass in 2003.[1]
- They sat while performing for years but switched to standing in June 2010 at The Elbo Room in Crested Butte, Colorado, after fans in the tiny bar couldn't see them seated.[1]
- Fiddler Ryan Young previously played drums in a speed metal band, and none of the members had bluegrass experience before forming the group.[2][3][4]
- Dave Simonett wrote his first song around age 18 in a college dorm room using a $50 Yamaha guitar bought in high school, with no specific triggering event.[8]
