## Biography
Sierra Maestra is a Cuban **son** ensemble formed in 1976 by a group of students at the University of Havana who set out to revive the classic 1920s son cubano associated with the Sierra Maestra mountain range in eastern Cuba.[1][2][4][7] At a time when this style was considered old‑fashioned “parents’ music,” the mostly non‑music majors—many studied engineering and technology—embraced the genre’s rural roots and named the band after the region where son had first flourished.[2][7] Their early performances on campus and around Cuba helped reintroduce classic son to younger audiences, contributing decisively to a late‑1970s and 1980s revival of the style.[3][5]  

Over the following decades Sierra Maestra developed into one of Cuba’s leading son bands, maintaining a traditional septeto/ensemble format with tres, trumpet, bongó, bass, guitar, and percussion while touring internationally and recording extensively.[2][3][5] The group’s lineup has included notable musicians such as **Juan de Marcos González**, who later founded the Afro‑Cuban All Stars, **José Antonio “Maceo” Rodríguez**, and trumpeter **Jesús Alemañy**, who went on to lead ¡Cubanismo!.[1][6] Under the musical direction of bassist and conga player **Eduardo Himely**, the band has received numerous awards, released around fourteen albums, and appeared on more than forty compilations, presenting both classic repertoire and new works that respect traditional son structures.[2][5]  

Musically, Sierra Maestra is rooted in the rhythmic and melodic language of early son and its precursor **changüí**, drawing on the instrumental textures and call‑and‑response vocals of 1920s Havana septets such as Septeto Nacional and Septeto Habanero.[2] While committed to historical authenticity, they also emphasize that they are innovators, inviting younger Cuban songwriters to craft contemporary lyrics within classic son forms, as on their album *Sonando Ya*, to connect with new generations of listeners.[2] Their recordings, including titles like *Con Sabor a Cuba*, *¡Dundunbanza!*, *El Guanajo Relleno*, *Tibiri Tabara*, *Rumbero Soy*, and *Son: Soul of a Nation*, and appearances at major festivals such as Glastonbury, have made them international ambassadors of son cubano and a key link between early 20th‑century Cuban dance music and global Latin and Afro‑Cuban jazz audiences.[1][2][3][4][5]

## Fun Facts
- Sierra Maestra was founded by University of Havana students, most of whom were studying engineering and technology rather than music; only one original member was a formal music student.[2]
- When Sierra Maestra began in the 1970s, classic son was considered “old people’s music” in Cuba, but their youthful performances helped spark a son revival among a new generation.[2][3][5]
- Despite starting as a campus group, Sierra Maestra has recorded around fourteen albums and appeared on more than forty compilations, touring the world so often that bassist/director Eduardo Himely says the number of tours is “too many times to count.”[2]
- The band takes its name from the Sierra Maestra mountain range in eastern Cuba, widely regarded as the birthplace of son, underscoring their mission to reconnect the music with its rural origins.[1][2][4]

## Musical Connections

### Mentors/Influences
- [[septeto_nacional|Septeto Nacional]] - Historical and stylistic model; Sierra Maestra patterned their classic son septet format and repertoire on early Havana groups like Septeto Nacional, who popularized son in the 1910s–1930s. (Recreation and reinterpretation of 1920s–1940s son standards associated with Havana septets (general repertoire rather than a single album).) [Primary influence from band’s founding in 1976 onward.[2]]
- [[septeto_habanero|Septeto Habanero]] - Another foundational Havana septet whose instrumentation, arrangements, and repertoire informed Sierra Maestra’s traditional son sound. (Classic son pieces from the 1920s–1940s son canon frequently revived in Sierra Maestra’s live sets and recordings.) [Ongoing stylistic influence since the late 1970s.[2]]
- [[changüí_traditions_of_oriente_e.g._guantánamo_region_musicians|Changüí traditions of Oriente (e.g., Guantánamo region musicians)]] - Eduardo Himely cites changüí from the mountains of Oriente as the precursor to son, shaping Sierra Maestra’s understanding of rhythm, instrumentation, and rural roots. (Use of tres, bongó, marímbola‑inspired bass concepts, and rural rhythmic patterns in their son arrangements.) [Conceptual and stylistic influence throughout the band’s history.[2]]

### Key Collaborators
- [[juan_de_marcos_gonzález|Juan de Marcos González]] - Founding member of Sierra Maestra who later became an important collaborator in promoting Cuban son worldwide through his subsequent projects. (Early Sierra Maestra recordings and tours prior to his departure; later creator of Afro‑Cuban All Stars after leaving the band in 1996.) [Member and collaborator from 1976 until 1996.[1][6]]
- [[jesús_alemañy|Jesús Alemañy]] - Trumpeter in Sierra Maestra whose work with the band helped shape its brass sound before he left to form ¡Cubanismo!. (Contributions to Sierra Maestra’s classic son albums up to mid‑1990s; later known for ¡Cubanismo! recordings that extend the son and Afro‑Cuban jazz tradition.) [Member and collaborator up to around 1996.[1][6]]
- [[josé_antonio_maceo_rodríguez|José Antonio “Maceo” Rodríguez]] - Key band member (singer/percussionist) who helped define Sierra Maestra’s vocal and rhythmic style during their classic period. (Featured on core albums such as *Con Sabor a Cuba*, *¡Dundunbanza!* and other 1990s recordings (credited as a principal member).) [Active member primarily during the 1980s and 1990s.[1][6]]
- [[young_cuban_songwriters_on_sonando_ya|Young Cuban songwriters on *Sonando Ya*]] - Invited by Sierra Maestra to contribute new lyrics within traditional son structures to reach a younger generation of listeners. (Album *Sonando Ya*, which features compositions by these younger writers performed in a classic son style.) [Collaboration in the 2000s (around the release period of *Sonando Ya*). [2]]

### Artists Influenced
- [[afrocuban_all_stars_via_juan_de_marcos_gonzález|Afro‑Cuban All Stars (via Juan de Marcos González)]] - Juan de Marcos carried Sierra Maestra’s mission of reviving and internationalizing classic son into the Afro‑Cuban All Stars, helping to shape that ensemble’s traditional yet expansive approach. (Early Afro‑Cuban All Stars albums and projects that spotlight veteran soneros and classic Cuban repertoire.) [From the group’s founding in 1996 onward; influence rooted in his 1976–1996 tenure with Sierra Maestra.[1][2][6]]
- [[cubanismo_via_jesús_alemañy|¡Cubanismo! (via Jesús Alemañy)]] - Alemañy’s experience in Sierra Maestra’s traditional son ensemble informed the brass‑heavy, dance‑oriented Afro‑Cuban sound of ¡Cubanismo!, which blends son with jazz and salsa. (Mid‑ to late‑1990s ¡Cubanismo! recordings that modernize classic Cuban dance styles for international audiences.) [From ¡Cubanismo!’s formation in 1996 onward.[1][6]]
- [[younger_cuban_son_and_timba_musicians|Younger Cuban son and timba musicians]] - By making classic son attractive to youth in the 1970s–1980s and later inviting young songwriters for *Sonando Ya*, Sierra Maestra provided a model for balancing tradition with contemporary themes, influencing later generations of Cuban dance bands. (Indirect influence evident in modern Cuban son and timba repertoire that references classic son forms while updating lyrics and arrangements.) [From the late 1970s revival through the 2000s; ongoing.[2][3][5]]
