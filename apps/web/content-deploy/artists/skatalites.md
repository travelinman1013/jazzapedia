## Biography
The Skatalites are a pioneering Jamaican ska band formed in 1964 by a group of virtuoso session musicians who had been playing together since the late 1950s in Kingston's burgeoning recording scene. Key founders included tenor saxophonist Tommy McCook, alto saxophonist Rolando Alphonso, trombonist Don Drummond, trumpeter Johnny Moore, drummer Lloyd Knibb, bassist Lloyd Brevett, guitarist Jah Jerry Haynes, pianist Jackie Mittoo, and singer Doreen Shaffer. Emerging from informal jam sessions at places like Kingston Pier and the Orange Bowl, they officially united at a meeting in early 1964 encouraged by Lord Tanamo and theatre owners. Over their initial 14-month run until 1965, they defined the ska sound—a high-energy fusion of jazz, mento, and R&B—backing countless hits for artists like Bob Marley & The Wailers ('Simmer Down'), Prince Buster, Jimmy Cliff, Toots & The Maytals, and Alton Ellis, while releasing their own instrumentals such as 'Guns of Navarone,' which reached the British Top 40.[1][2][3][6]

The band disbanded in August 1965 amid internal rivalries, the death of Don Drummond, and shifts in Jamaican music toward rocksteady and reggae, with members continuing as session players and in other groups. Sporadic reunions began in 1974 for Lloyd Brevett's solo album at Lee 'Scratch' Perry's studio, but the full reformation came in 1983 at the Reggae Sunsplash festival in Montego Bay, prompted by promoter Ronnie Burke despite tensions between Moore and McCook. This led to international tours, emigration to the US in the 1970s-80s, and a prolific output including Grammy-nominated albums like *Skavoovee* (1987), *Hi-Bop Ska* (1994), and *Greetings from Skamania*. Despite losing many original members (e.g., McCook and Alphonso in 1998, Brevett in 2012, Sterling in 2023), they remain active, marking over 60 years of influence by 2025.[1][2][4]

The Skatalites' legacy lies in inventing ska, shaping Jamaican popular music's evolution into rocksteady, reggae, dub, and roots reggae, and influencing global genres like ska punk. Their raw, horn-driven style and session work on hundreds of tracks established them as Jamaica's first supergroup, with enduring impact seen in their backing of early reggae icons and continued performances.[3][4][6]

## Fun Facts
- The Skatalites were together for just 14 months originally (June 1964-August 1965) but backed hundreds of Jamaican hits and defined ska as Jamaica's first supergroup.
- They reunited in 1974 purely for Lloyd Brevett's solo album *African Roots* at Lee Perry's studio, marking the first post-breakup gathering of core members.
- Despite disbanding in 1965, 'Guns of Navarone' hit the British Top 40 in 1967 under the Skatalites name, years after they stopped recording as a unit.
- Band members first jammed as teenagers at Kingston's Coney Island street fair and spots like the Orange Bowl in the late 1940s-1950s before formalizing.
