## Biography
Brian Blade, born on July 25, 1970, in Shreveport, Louisiana, grew up in a musical family with his father, Rev. Brady L. Blade, Sr., serving as pastor since 1961, fostering an early immersion in church music and gospel traditions that profoundly shaped his rhythmic sensibility[1][3][9]. Blade's musical journey deepened at Loyola University in New Orleans, where he met pianist Jon Cowherd in 1988 and studied alongside masters like Ellis Marsalis, John Vidacovich, and Steve Masakowski, honing his skills in jazz, R&B, and beyond before moving to New York in 1992[4][5]. There, he rapidly gained acclaim as a first-call drummer, collaborating with Kenny Garrett, Mark Turner, and Joshua Redman, while forming The Fellowship Band in 1997 with Cowherd at its core, blending jazz innovation with Americana, gospel, and chamber influences[1][2][4].

The Fellowship Band debuted with *Brian Blade Fellowship* in 1998 on Blue Note Records, followed by *Perceptual* (2000), *Season of Changes* (2008), *Landmarks* (2014), *Body and Shadow* (2017), *Live from the Archives* (2022), and *Kings Highway* (2023), establishing Blade as a composer and bandleader pushing jazz boundaries through emotive, telepathic interplay[2][4][6]. Parallel to this, Blade's career flourished with long-term roles in Wayne Shorter's quartet from 2000 until Shorter's death in 2023, alongside Danilo Pérez and John Patitucci, and sessions with Joni Mitchell, Chick Corea, Norah Jones, Emmylou Harris, and Bob Dylan, showcasing his versatile, poetic drumming that merges punk energy, velvet smoothness, and spiritual depth[1][2][3][5].

Blade's legacy endures as a rhythm poet and innovator, with The Fellowship Band remaining a vital platform for his compositional vision over 26 years, influencing contemporary jazz through its genre-defying sound and enduring collaborations that reflect his roots in Shreveport's church and New Orleans' jazz lineage[1][2][9].
