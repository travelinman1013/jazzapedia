## Biography
The Promise Ring is an American rock band formed in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in 1995 from the remnants of local emo and post-hardcore groups. Guitarist Jason Gnewikow (from None Left Standing) and drummer Dan Didier (from Ceilishrine) started the project, soon joined by guitarist/vocalist Davey von Bohlen of Cap'n Jazz, with bassist Scott Beschta initially on board; the core trio of Gnewikow, Didier, and von Bohlen remained throughout, while bassists rotated, with Scott Schoenbeck serving the longest.[1][2] Their early sound built on Midwestern emo roots, blending post-hardcore intensity with punk influences on their 1996 Jade Tree debut *30° Everywhere*, praised as a genre benchmark despite the band's later ambivalence toward it.[1][3]

Over their initial run through 2002, The Promise Ring released key albums including *Nothing Feels Good* (1997), *Very Emergency* (1999), and *Wood/Water* (2002), evolving from raw second-wave emo—characterized by catchy, intense riffs and von Bohlen's distinctive froggy croon and imagist lyrics—to pop-punk, power pop, and indie pop experimentation.[1][3] They became leaders of the geographically diverse second-wave emo alongside bands like Mineral and Sunny Day Real Estate, playing basement shows and VFW halls while achieving indie success, with *30° Everywhere* selling tens of thousands.[1][3] The band disbanded in 2002 but reunited periodically, leaving a lasting imprint on emo's evolution.[1][7]

Their legacy endures as pioneers of midwest emo, post-hardcore, and math rock, influencing the genre's revival in the 2000s and beyond through their shift from aggressive emo to melodic introspection, cementing Milwaukee's role in the subgenre's heartland origins.[1][3][4]
