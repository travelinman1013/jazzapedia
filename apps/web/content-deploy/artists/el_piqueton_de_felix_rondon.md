## Quick Info

- **Spotify Popularity**: 1/100
- **Followers**: 70

## Biography
There is extremely little verifiable public information about **El Piqueton de Felix Rondon** beyond basic discographic traces. Available sources indicate that this name refers to a Cuban son project associated with the musician **Félix Rondón**, and that the music is categorized as *son cubano*, aligning it stylistically with traditional Cuban dance and salon music.[2][4][5] The project appears primarily on compilations and streaming platforms rather than as a heavily promoted standalone act, which likely explains its very low popularity metrics on services such as Spotify.

El Piqueton de Felix Rondon is documented on compilation releases such as **“Tumi All-Stars – Cabaret AliBar”**, where the track **“Misercordia, Que Es Esto!”** is credited to *El Piqueton De Felix Rondon*, and on lounge/Latin compilations like **“Cuban Lounge Music”**, where **“Misericordia”** is credited to *El Piqueton de Felix Rondon, Felix Rondon*.[4][5] These credits situate the project in the contemporary recording and reissue ecosystem that highlights Cuban son, suggesting that El Piqueton de Felix Rondon functions as either a studio ensemble or recording alias used for modern presentations of traditional-style Cuban repertoire. However, no reliable biographical details—such as birth date, birthplace, career timeline, or detailed band history—are available in accessible reference sources, label notes, or recognized music databases.

Stylistically, the tracks linked to El Piqueton de Felix Rondon are grouped alongside other **traditional and revivalist Cuban son** artists on discovery platforms, which implies a sound rooted in classic son structures (call-and-response vocals, tres or guitar, percussion-heavy grooves) adapted for modern listening contexts.[2][4] Because no interviews, label biographies, or press materials could be located, any further claims about early life, career development, or long-term legacy would be speculative and cannot be substantiated from credible sources.
