## Biography
Big Daddy 'O' (Owen Tufts) is a blues musician who has built a career performing in roadhouses and bars throughout the delta region near the Louisiana/Mississippi border for more than thirty years.[1][3] Standing 6'6" tall, he is known for his commanding stage presence and distinctive vocal range that can shift from a powerful shout to a delicate whisper.[1][3] Discovered by Rabadash Records playing at Betty's Bar in Amite, Louisiana around the turn of the century, Big Daddy 'O' has since released multiple critically acclaimed albums and expanded his reach to a national audience.[1] His musical approach transforms each song into a personal statement, performed either as a solo artist with an acoustic guitar custom-made by luthier Scott Quiroz or with a full blues band, showcasing his considerable blues skills on a 1969 Les Paul Deluxe.[1] His music has gained recognition beyond live performance, being featured in the award-winning animated feature film "The Magistical."[3]
