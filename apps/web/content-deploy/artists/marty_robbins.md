## Biography
Marty Robbins, born Martin David Robinson on September 26, 1925, in Glendale, Arizona, grew up in a large, nomadic family facing hardship after his parents' divorce when he was 12. One of nine or ten children, he was influenced by his maternal grandfather 'Texas Bob' Heckle, a storyteller whose tales of the American West inspired many of Robbins' later songs like 'Big Iron.' Dropping out of high school, Robbins worked odd jobs before enlisting in the U.S. Navy at 17 during World War II, where he taught himself guitar in the Pacific theater and developed a love for Hawaiian music.[1][3][4]

After his 1946 discharge, Robbins married Marizona Baldwin and began performing in Phoenix clubs, hosting radio shows like *Chuck Wagon Time* and TV's *Western Caravan*. Little Jimmy Dickens helped secure his Columbia Records deal in 1951, leading to his first No. 1 country hit 'I'll Go On Alone' in 1952, followed by 'Singing the Blues,' 'A White Sport Coat (and a Pink Carnation),' and 'The Story of My Life.' He joined the Grand Ole Opry in 1953, blending classic country, Western storytelling, Hawaiian styles, and crossover pop appeal, with narrative epics like 'El Paso' (1959) defining his gunfighter ballad style.[1][3][4]

Robbins' versatile career spanned over 90 Billboard country chart entries, NASCAR racing, and acting until his death from cardiac arrest on December 8, 1982, at age 57. His legacy endures as a country pioneer whose cinematic songs and smooth vocals bridged genres, earning Grammy awards and lasting influence.[1][3][6]
