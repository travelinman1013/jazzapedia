## Biography
Cecilia Villar Eljuri, born in Guayaquil, Ecuador, to a Lebanese mother who was an accomplished pianist and composer of traditional Ecuadorian pasillos and boleros, and a Spanish father who introduced her to cha-cha and Afro-Cuban music, was raised in New York City. Immersed in the city's vibrant music scene, she sneaked into iconic venues like CBGBs as a teenager, drawing influences from punk, rock, reggae, and global sounds, which shaped her early passion for guitar—she began playing around age 12, formed her first bands at 14, and performed at CBGBs and the Bitter End by 17. Her multicultural upbringing fused these elements into a distinctive style blending rock, reggae, world rhythms, Latin genres like bolero and pasillo, with powerful, socially conscious lyrics in English and Spanish, earning her the title of 'artivist' for combining music with activism on human rights and environmental issues.[1][2][3][5][7]

Eljuri's career took off with her band Grupo Fiesta, a Latin Rock Pop group, followed by a successful solo trajectory marked by critically acclaimed albums like 'La Lucha,' 'Fuerte,' 'En Paz' (2008, featuring collaborations with Sly & Robbie and Johnette Napolitano), and her upcoming sixth studio album 'La Vida' in August 2025 via Manovill Records and Six Degrees Music Distribution. Named one of the top Latin guitarists worldwide and a Gibson Family of Artists member since 2008, she has toured extensively across North and South America, Europe, and festivals like Hillside Festival 2025 and Women's March events, with her singles topping indie, college, worldbeat, and Latin radio charts in the US, Canada, and Mexico. Her accolades include Billboard, John Lennon, and International Songwriting Awards, and she mentors youth through programs like SoundThinking.[1][2][3][4][5]

Beyond music, Eljuri's legacy as a role model for strong female artists and social change-maker includes organizing NYC Women's Marches and launching the 2024 Eljuri Concerts for Democracy tour with voting organizations to boost youth voter registration, solidifying her impact as a musical ambassador for civil rights and environmental causes.[2][3]
