- **Origin**: Kingston

## Biography
The Skatalites are a pioneering Jamaican ska band formed in 1964 by a collective of virtuoso session musicians who had been playing together informally since the late 1950s in Kingston's vibrant music scene. Key founders included tenor saxophonist Tommy McCook, alto saxophonist Rolando Alphonso, trombonist Don Drummond, trumpeter Johnny 'Dizzy' Moore, drummer Lloyd Knibb, bassist Lloyd Brevett, rhythm guitarist Jah Jerry Haynes, pianist Jackie Mittoo, and singer Doreen Shaffer, among others. Emerging from studios like those of Stanley Motta and Coxsone Dodd, they backed countless artists on hundreds of recordings, including early hits by Bob Marley & The Wailers ('Simmer Down'), Prince Buster, Jimmy Cliff, Toots & The Maytals, and Alton Ellis, while releasing their own instrumental ska covers and originals like 'Guns of Navarone'. Their sound fused jazz, mento, calypso, and R&B into the upbeat, syncopated rhythm of **ska**, defining the genre during its explosive 14-month original run from June 1964 to August 1965, when internal rivalries and the tragic death of Don Drummond in 1969 led to the band's initial breakup.[1][2][3]

## Fun Facts
- The band's first rehearsal in May 1964 at The Odeon Theatre turned into an impromptu public show due to overwhelming crowd demand, marking their instant popularity.[6]
- They were not officially a band until June 1964, despite backing thousands of Jamaican hits as session players since the late 1950s.[1][3][5]
- The original lineup split after just 14 months in 1965, partly due to the emotional impact of trombonist Don Drummond's institutionalization and death in 1969.[1][3][5]
- Reunited in 1983 for Reggae Sunsplash despite internal feuds, leading to decades of global touring and Grammy-nominated albums like *Hi-Bop Ska*.[1][2]
