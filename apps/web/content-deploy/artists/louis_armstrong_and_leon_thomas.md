## Biography
Louis Armstrong and Leon Thomas were not a formal musical duo or group, but rather two distinct jazz artists who collaborated on a notable recording. Louis Armstrong (1901-1971) was a legendary jazz trumpeter and vocalist who pioneered scat singing and became one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century. Leon Thomas was a jazz vocalist known for his distinctive yodeling vocal style and work in free jazz. Their most significant collaboration occurred in 1970 when they recorded together for the album 'Louis Armstrong and His Friends,' produced by Bob Thiele for Flying Dutchman Productions. On this album, they performed 'The Creator Has a Master Plan,' a composition by Pharaoh Sanders and Leon Thomas that had originally been recorded as a 32-minute meditation on Sanders's 1969 album 'Karma.' The pairing brought together Armstrong's pioneering scat technique with Thomas's innovative vocal approach, creating an unlikely but complementary partnership that showcased both artists' mastery of vocal improvisation.

## Fun Facts

- Armstrong prepared for the recording by listening to Leon Thomas's original 1969 recording of 'The Creator Has a Master Plan' with Pharaoh Sanders, which was a meditative 32-minute performance that had been edited down to become a surprising radio hit.[2]
- The recording session for 'Louis Armstrong and His Friends' began with a party where Bob Thiele invited notable musicians including Miles Davis, Ornette Coleman, and Tony Bennett to contribute to the opening track 'We Shall Overcome.'[3]
- Leon Thomas mentioned that recording 'The Creator Has a Master Plan' with Louis Armstrong was one of the greatest highlights of his career, reflecting the mutual respect between the two artists despite their different musical backgrounds.[1]
