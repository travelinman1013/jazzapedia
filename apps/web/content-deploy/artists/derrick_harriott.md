## Biography
Derrick Clifton Harriott, born on February 6, 1939, in Kingston, Jamaica, began his musical career in the late 1950s as a member of the duo Sang and Harriott and the harmony group Jiving Juniors, performing at talent shows and sound systems during the ska era. By 1960, he launched his own Crystal record label, becoming one of Jamaica's pioneering artist-producers, with early hits like 'What Can I Do (The Wedding Song)' recorded at Federal Records studio. Transitioning into rocksteady, which he considered the greatest era of Jamaican music for its melodies, lyrics, and musicianship, Harriott opened his first record shop on King Street in Kingston and released soul-influenced solo tracks alongside productions for artists like Keith and Tex, the Ethiopians, and Rudy Mills.[1][2][3]

Harriott's career peaked in the reggae era of the 1970s, where he produced classics with Dennis Brown (whom he discovered), Earl 16, Winston McAnuff, Augustus Pablo, King Tubby, and Big Youth, while releasing instrumental dub albums like The Crystalites' *The Undertaker* and *Scrub A Dub*. Named Top Producer of 1970 by Swing Magazine, he incorporated black consciousness themes in songs like 'Message from a Black Man' and later moved his shop to Half-Way Tree. His sophisticated, dapper funky sound evolved through the dancehall 80s and 90s with hits like duets with Yellowman and Papa San, and solo albums such as *Sings Jamaican Rock Steady Reggae*.[3][4][5]

Harriott's legacy endures as a key figure bridging ska, rocksteady, reggae, and dub, influencing Jamaican music's evolution with his production innovations and soulful style, continuing to release music into the late 1990s.
