## Biography
Jamey Johnson is an American country and outlaw country singer-songwriter born on July 14, 1975, in Enterprise, Alabama, and based in Montgomery, Alabama.[1] After quitting college, Johnson served eight years in the United States Marine Corps Reserve, during which he began performing country music in bars around Montgomery, including an early opening slot for David Allan Coe.[1] He moved to Nashville, Tennessee, around 2000 to pursue a professional music career, initially finding success as a songwriter for established artists before securing his own recording contract.

Johnson's recording career began in 2005 when he signed with BNA Records, releasing his debut single "The Dollar" in 2005 and his self-titled debut album in March 2006, which peaked at No. 14 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart.[1] However, he was dropped from BNA in 2006 after his second single "Rebelicious" failed to chart.[1] During this difficult period, Johnson wrote songs for other artists, including "Give It Away" for George Strait, which became Strait's 51st No. 1 hit on the Billboard country charts.[1] Following personal struggles and a reclusive period, Johnson signed with Mercury Nashville Records in March 2008 and released his second album, the gold-certified *That Lonesome Song*.[1] His work during this era, particularly songs like "High Cost of Living," established him as an authentic voice in the outlaw country movement, addressing real-life struggles with unflinching honesty.

Johnson's musical style is rooted in the outlaw country tradition, characterized by a minimalist approach to production, raw emotional directness, and resistance to Nashville's commercial establishment.[2] His gravelly vocal style and songwriting approach draw heavily from the pioneering outlaw artists of the 1970s, positioning him among contemporary country singers who successfully emulate that era's aesthetic and ethos.[2]
