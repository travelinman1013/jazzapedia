## Biography
Davood Asgari, known professionally as Locksmith, was born on September 29, 1984, in Richmond, California, to a half African-American and Iranian (Persian) father and mother. Growing up in a tight-knit family with four siblings and supportive parents, he was initially focused on basketball rather than music, but was subconsciously influenced by his sister, a rapper in the 1990s East Bay scene who opened for artists like E-40, Blackalicious, and Digital Underground. Sheltered from street life, Locksmith developed a reflective mindset that shaped his conscious approach to hip-hop. He graduated from UC Berkeley with a Bachelor of Arts in African American Studies, blending academic insight with his artistic pursuits.[1][6]
