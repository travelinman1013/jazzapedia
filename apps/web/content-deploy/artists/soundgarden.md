## Biography
Soundgarden, a pioneering grunge band, was formed in Seattle, Washington, in 1984 by vocalist/drummer Chris Cornell, guitarist Kim Thayil, and bassist Hiro Yamamoto, who named the band after a local sound sculpture installation in Sand Point. Cornell initially handled both vocals and drums, a setup inspired by Phil Collins, but the band soon recruited drummer Scott Sundquist in 1985 to allow Cornell to focus on singing. Their early releases included contributions to the 1986 C/Z Records compilation Deep Six and Sub Pop EPs Screaming Life (1987) and Fopp (1988), establishing them as key players in the Seattle scene. Lineup changes followed: Sundquist was replaced by Matt Cameron in 1986, and Yamamoto left in 1989 after Louder Than Love, briefly succeeded by Jason Everman before Ben Shepherd joined permanently.[1][2][3][4]

The band's career breakthrough came with Badmotorfinger in 1991 on A&M Records, featuring hits like 'Outshined' and 'Rusty Cage,' coinciding with the grunge explosion alongside Nirvana and Pearl Jam. They toured extensively, including Lollapalooza 1992, and achieved massive success with Superunknown (1994), a multi-platinum album with MTV staple 'Black Hole Sun' and Grammy wins for 'Spoonman' and 'Black Hole Sun.' Down on the Upside (1996) followed before disbanding in 1997 amid internal tensions. Reuniting in 2010, they released King Animal (2012), but Cornell's death in 2017 ended further activity. Soundgarden's heavy riffs, Cornell's soaring vocals, and blend of metal, punk, and psychedelia defined grunge's raw power.[1][2][3]

Soundgarden's legacy as grunge trailblazers endures, with Grammy nominations like Ultramega OK (1989) and cultural impact through films like Singles (1992). Their music influenced rock's shift from glam metal to authenticity, selling millions worldwide despite lineup flux and hiatuses.[1][4]
