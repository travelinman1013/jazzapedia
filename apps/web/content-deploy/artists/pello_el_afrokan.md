## Biography
Pedro Izquierdo Padrón, known as Pello el Afrokán, was born on January 7, 1933, in Havana's Jesús María neighborhood, a vibrant rumba district, during a period of political upheaval following the fall of dictator Gerardo Machado. Grandson of Mandingo Africans, he inherited a deep percussion tradition; his father was an early percussionist in Belisario López’s band, and legendary congueros frequented their home, shaping his innate rhythmic sensibility from childhood.[1][2][3]

Pello began performing as a teenager, working as a stevedore on Havana's docks while playing percussion wherever needed and composing jingles for CMQ radio. In 1959, post-revolution, he founded his own group, performing at the famed Tropicana cabaret. By 1962, he experimented with fusing Afro-Cuban elements, creating the explosive mozambique rhythm in 1963—a 'stew' of conga drums, bass drums, bells, brass, and innovative choreography that premiered at the University of Havana and debuted on TV amid the Beatles craze. He taught at the National Art Instructors’ School and maintained a four-year TV program, with mozambique dominating Havana carnivals.[1][2][3]

Pello's mozambique galvanized Cuban youth, countering pop invasions with Afro-Cuban power, and he toured globally to Europe, Russia, Latin America, and beyond. Hits like 'Camina como cómico,' 'Ileana quiere chocolate,' 'María Caracoles,' and 'Mozambique número 1' defined his legacy. He died of cancer on September 11, 2000, at age 67, buried with Abakuá rites and mozambique played by his grandson Omar's group.[1][3]
