## Biography
Ernesto Antonio 'Tito' Puente Jr. was born on April 20, 1923, in New York City to Puerto Rican parents, growing up immersed in the vibrant Latin music scene of Spanish Harlem. As a child, he honed his skills as a dancer and musician, studying percussion, piano, and saxophone at the Juilliard School after using his G.I. Bill benefits following three years of Navy service during World War II, where he played in the ship's band and served in battles like Leyte and Midway. In 1948, he formed his own band, which evolved into the Tito Puente Orchestra, blending traditional Latin rhythms with big-band jazz arrangements.

Puente's career exploded in the 1950s as a leader of the mambo craze, releasing his breakthrough album *Dance Mania* in 1958, featuring hits like 'Ran Kan Kan' and 'Oye Como Va.' Known for his timbales mastery, infectious energy, and showmanship, he pioneered the fusion of mambo, cha-cha-cha, salsa, and Latin jazz, later incorporating merengue, bossa nova, and Afro-Cuban elements. Over five decades, he recorded over 100 albums, composed more than 200 pieces, and performed relentlessly—up to 300 gigs a year—collaborating with jazz icons and introducing stars like Celia Cruz to U.S. audiences, while appearing in films such as *The Mambo Kings*.

Dubbed 'El Rey de los Timbales' and 'King of Latin Music,' Puente earned five Grammy Awards (with more nominations), the National Medal of Arts, a Hollywood Walk of Fame star, and a Latin Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. He died on May 31, 2000, in New York City, leaving an indelible legacy as a musical pioneer who bridged Latin traditions with global audiences.
