## Biography
Kendrick Lamar Duckworth was born on June 17, 1987, in Compton, California, where he was immersed in the vibrant hip-hop scene of the West Coast. As a teenager, he began rapping under the name K-Dot, releasing his first mixtape *Youngest Head Nigga in Charge* in 2003, followed by others like *Training Day* and *C4*. In 2010, he adopted his birth name and dropped *Overly Dedicated*, which charted on Billboard's Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums, catching the attention of Dr. Dre after a music video viewing. Signing with Top Dawg Entertainment (TDE) in 2005 and later entering a joint venture with Interscope and Aftermath in 2012 marked his transition from independent artist to major label star.[1][2][3]

Lamar's career exploded with his major-label debut *good kid, m.A.A.D city* (2012), a critically acclaimed concept album depicting Compton life, featuring hits like 'Swimming Pools (Drank).' He infused hip-hop with jazz, funk, soul, and African-American historical elements in *To Pimp a Butterfly* (2015), earning a Pulitzer Prize in 2018—the first for a non-classical or jazz artist. Albums like *DAMN.* (2017), *Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers* (2022), and *GNX* (2024) solidified his introspective style, addressing personal struggles, social issues, and feuds, including his 2024 clash with Drake that produced number-one hits like 'Not Like Us.' By 2026, he holds 27 Grammy Awards, the most for any rapper.[1][3]

Lamar's legacy as one of the greatest lyricists includes five consecutive Billboard 200 number-one albums, record-breaking tours like the Big Steppers Tour ($110.9 million gross), and cultural impact through films and production. His work blends raw storytelling, political commentary, and genre fusion, influencing modern hip-hop while grappling with fame, mental health, and Compton roots.[1][3]
