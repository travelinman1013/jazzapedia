## Biography
Albert Chevalier (1861–1923) was born on March 21 in Notting Hill, London, to a French father and Welsh mother. Initially pursuing acting from 1877, he appeared in plays like Arthur Pinero's *The Magistrate* (1885) and *The Schoolmistress* (1886), and became principal comedian at the Avenue Theatre in burlesques by 1889. Facing theatrical setbacks, he transitioned to music halls in the 1880s, debuting at the London Pavilion in 1891 with songs like 'The Coster’s Serenade,' earning immediate acclaim as the 'costers' laureate' for his Cockney dialect songs depicting working-class London life as a costermonger.[2][3][4]

Chevalier co-wrote hits with his brother Charles Ingle, including 'Wot Cher! Knocked 'em in the Old Kent Road,' 'The Future Mrs. 'Awkins,' and 'My Old Dutch,' performing at major London halls and touring provinces and the U.S. starting in 1896. He refused obscenity in his acts, elevating music hall's reputation, and later gave recitals at venues like Queen's Hall from 1899 and toured with Yvette Guilbert in 1906. By the 1900s, he was among London's highest-paid stars, also acting in plays like J.M. Barrie's *Pantaloon*.[2][3][4]

His legacy includes pioneering the coster style, writing his own material, making early recordings and films like *My Old Dutch* (1915), and contributing to variety entertainment's development. Supported by figures like George Bernard Shaw, he innovated popular performance while portraying aspirational Cockney romanticism, rivaled only by Dan Leno.[3][4]
