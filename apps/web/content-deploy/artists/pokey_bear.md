## Biography
Wardell 'Pokey Bear' Brown was born on February 2, 1970, in Baton Rouge, Louisiana (with some sources noting Houston, Texas as an early connection), where he developed an early passion for music. During his teenage years, he performed with family groups like George Perkins & the Voice of Harmony and Kenneth Mitchell & the Voices of Praise. He attended Delta State University, playing on their Division II championship football team, before transferring to Southern University and joining the Concert Choir. Initially pursuing rap as part of Houston's Screwed Up Click with DJ Screw in the early 1990s, he released albums like Hardest Pit in the Litter (1999), D-Game 2000 (2000), and Da Sky's da Limit (2002), blending mid-tempo 808 beats with a Notorious B.I.G.-like style.[1][2][5][6]

Transitioning to southern soul and blues in the 2010s, Pokey Bear mixed old-school R&B-infused bayou soul with swagger and upbeat trends. He formed one-third of the Louisiana Blues Brothas alongside Tyree Neal (cousin of Jackie Neal) and Adrian Bagher, releasing Love on the Bayou (2014) featuring his breakout hit 'My Sidepiece,' which amassed over 7 million Spotify streams. His solo debut Josephine Son Pokey arrived in 2014, followed by Mr. It Ain't Fair (2016) with tracks like 'Good Foot' and 'Shake That Money Maker' featuring Mystikal, and Crown Me (2020).[1][4][5][6]

Pokey Bear's larger-than-life persona and party-starting sound, akin to Willie Clayton and James Brown, have made him a southern blues staple, touring nationwide and earning regional acclaim through producers like Beat Flippa and Highway Heavy.[1][4][6]
