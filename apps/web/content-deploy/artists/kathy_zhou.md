## Biography
Kathy Zhou is an indie-pop pianist, singer-songwriter, band frontwoman, and composer based in Memphis, Tennessee.[1] She began formal classical piano training at age 7 in California, where she trained intensively and won nationwide classical piano competitions while also performing in school bands and orchestra pits for musicals.[1] However, the pressure of competitive classical training and a sense that piano was underappreciated compared to other instruments led to burnout; she stopped playing music entirely when she began her studies at UCLA.[1]

After college, Zhou redirected her creative energy by founding a performing arts outreach club at UCLA that provided music and theatre opportunities to students at low-income secondary schools.[1] She later joined Teach For America and taught high school in rural Arkansas, where exposure to Memphis's vibrant musical scene reignited her passion for music.[1] At age 29, she made the pivotal decision to pursue music professionally, teaching herself to sing, learning pop songs, and beginning to write her own music and lyrics.[1] Over the following four years, she established herself through piano bar residencies, performances at various Memphis venues, original music releases, theatrical compositions, and a music video that became a finalist in the 2023 Indie Memphis Film Festival.[1]

Zhou's musical style blurs genre boundaries, incorporating traces of pop, rock, vintage folk, theatre, and classical elements.[1] Her work is characterized by piano-powered arrangements combined with theatrical, witty lyrics and expressive vocals, with her original songs described as "mesmerizing" and evoking imagery of stormy islands, colorful nightmares, and dramatic storybooks.[1] She released her debut single "Strange Child" in 2022, a piano-driven folk-rock narrative based on a childhood nightmare.[1]
