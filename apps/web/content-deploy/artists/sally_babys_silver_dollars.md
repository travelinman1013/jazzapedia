## Biography
Sally Baby's Silver Dollars is a New Orleans-based band founded by singer, songwriter, guitarist, composer, music historian, and jazz tour guide Salvatore 'Sally Baby' Geloso, also known as Sal Geloso. Originally a former underground seven-piece ensemble, the band emerged from Geloso's songwriting, which draws deeply from New Orleans' musical traditions. Geloso, a post-Katrina transplant who has lived in the city since 2008 (over 17-18 years as of recent accounts), began absorbing the local scene by exploring early jazz artists like Sweet Emma Barrett, Preservation Hall Band, and Kid Ory, as well as brass bands and spasm bands with handmade instruments. His early experiences included busking on streets, playing tiny 9th Ward dives, and spontaneous block parties that drew crowds organically[1][2][3].

The band's career accelerated after placing as runner-up (silver medal equivalent) in NPR's 2024 Tiny Desk Contest with their submission 'I've Got No More Tears Left to Cry,' featured on NPR's Morning Edition with an interview by Scott Simon. This propelled them from local obscurity to national stages, including French Quarter Festival, New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival (Jazz Fest), High Sierra Music Festival, Oregon County Fair, Crankie Festival, and a 2026 Tiny Desk Concert takeover with songs like 'Devil's Shoe String,' 'Gargoyle,' and 'Down in New Orleans.' Geloso's originals blend with adapted songs, supported by classically trained musicians who expand arrangements into orchestral, funky sounds influenced by early Creole jazz, New Orleans R&B, second line, brass bands, and calypso[1][2][3][4].

Geloso's charismatic stage presence, honed through theater background and French Quarter historic tours, emphasizes immersive live experiences. With backgrounds in opera, choral works like Mozart’s Requiem, and extensive resumes among members, the band embodies New Orleans' spirit—funky, timeless, and transcendent—while touring nationally and releasing music via platforms like Bandcamp[1][3][6].

## Fun Facts
- The band's Tiny Desk Contest entry 'I’ve Got No More Tears Left to Cry' nearly didn't happen but turned into a street block party when neighbors emerged during filming[1][3].
- Bassist Zach Valentine offered himself as Geloso's bass player after a chance coffee shop meeting, recording songs at home to build their initial duo set in 2020[1].
- Geloso studied opera and choral works like Mozart’s Requiem, bringing classical elements to the band's orchestral arrangements via Valentine's bowed bass melodies[1].
- The band evolved from Geloso feeling like a 'spasm band' kid with handmade instruments, emulating brass bands in a 'wacky' personal style upon arriving in New Orleans[1].
