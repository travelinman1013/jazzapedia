## Biography
Jack Logan, born on February 8, 1959, in Greenville, Mississippi, and raised in Lawrenceville, Illinois, is an American singer-songwriter known for his lo-fi, alt-country style. After college, he moved to Winder, Georgia, in 1985 with his best friend Kelly Keneipp, where they took blue-collar jobs repairing swimming pool pumps while writing and recording music for fun with a group of friends called the Liquor Cabinet. Inspired by punk rock's DIY ethos, Logan amassed over 600 songs recorded in garages, barns, and his home from 1979 to 1993, blending southern gothic storytelling with country ballads, rock anthems, and witty narratives about rural life, trailer parks, and truckers.[1][2][3][5]

Logan's career breakthrough came in the early 1990s when he sent demo tapes to producer Peter Jesperson, who was amazed by the material and signed him to Medium Cool/Twin/Tone Records. His 1994 debut album *Bulk*, a 42-track double album of lo-fi recordings, earned four-star reviews from *Rolling Stone* and widespread critical acclaim, thrusting him into the spotlight with college radio play and a 1995 appearance on *Late Night with Conan O'Brien*. He followed with *Mood Elevator* (1996, as Jack Logan and Liquor Cabinet), *Buzz Me In* (1999), and later releases like *Monkey Paw*, *Bones in the Desert* (2013), and *What Is This Some Kind of Joke?* (2015), often collaborating with his core circle while maintaining a prolific, unpolished approach.[1][2][4]

Logan's legacy endures as a cult figure in indie and alt-country scenes, celebrated for his raw, voluminous output and southern-inflected songwriting reminiscent of Flannery O'Connor's morality tales updated for modern working-class life. Despite major-label stints like Capricorn Records, he has largely self-released or worked with small labels like Backburner, co-owned with Keneipp, prioritizing personal expression over commercial success.[1][2][3][5]
