## Biography
Jovino Santos Neto & André Mehmari is a piano duo collaboration that celebrates the music of Brazilian master Hermeto Pascoal. Jovino Santos Neto, born in Rio de Janeiro in 1954, is a three-time Latin Grammy nominee and one of the most important Brazilian musicians working today. He studied biology at McGill University in Canada before returning to Brazil to join Hermeto Pascoal's legendary group in 1977, where he served as pianist, flutist, composer, producer, and arranger until 1992. During his 15 years with O Grupo, Pascoal became his primary mentor and musical school, profoundly shaping his artistic development. After relocating to Seattle, Washington in 1993, Santos Neto pursued a solo career while maintaining deep connections to Brazilian music and Pascoal's legacy.

André Mehmari, born April 22, 1977, is a Brazilian pianist, composer, and arranger known for his virtuosic pianism and improvisational skills. The two pianists came together in 2016-2017 to create the album Guris, a monumental celebration of Hermeto Pascoal's compositions. This collaboration brought together Jovino's intimate knowledge of Pascoal's complete repertoire—he served as musical director of O Grupo and editor of Tudo é Som, a book featuring 32 of Pascoal's best-known works—with Mehmari's youthful vigor and compositional talent. The album features both musicians on piano, melodica, and various keyboards, with special guest appearances by Hermeto Pascoal himself on teakettle and melodica, creating what critics describe as a structurally significant addition to Pascoal's musical legacy.
