## Biography
Aisha RaQuel, hailing from Hattiesburg, Mississippi, discovered her passion for music at age 3 upon hearing 'We Are The World' by Michael Jackson in preschool, which inspired her to create music that soothes and connects others. Spending significant time with her grandmother attending church nearly daily exposed her to singing and instruments from a young age, fostering her deep love for music. She wrote her first song in 4th or 5th grade, around the time she discovered the internet, and began posting songs on YouTube in 2009. In grade school, she enjoyed dancing and playing baseball, but music remained her true calling.

Her career began with the 2017 debut EP *New Rebel Groove*, establishing her unique 'groove' that blends genres, earning her the self-described title of 'soul rebel' for manifesting her heart's desires. She followed with the single 'C.F.S.P.' and her debut album *Iridescent* in July 2020, featuring tracks like 'Sayonara'—a rollercoaster of synth, tribal, lofi, pop, and hip hop—and 'Uh Huh.' Her music emphasizes self-awareness, encouraging listeners to recognize their mind, body, soul, and spirit while being mindful of the energy they project. Prior to her solo releases, she gained experience as a feature artist and backing vocalist.

Aisha RaQuel's style is a genre-melting pot, infused with soulful, nature-inspired creativity and New Orleans vibes. She is tech-savvy and artistic, proficient in creative software, video shooting, graphics, and engineering. Looking ahead, she plans more nature-themed projects across various forms.
