## Biography
James Fernando is an American jazz pianist, composer, and educator who began his musical journey at age five with classical piano training. His passion for jazz ignited in middle school, leading to early accolades including awards from Downbeat Magazine and the National Young Arts Foundation, a nomination for the Jazz Fellowship Awards of the American Pianists Association, selection for the Jazz Band of America, and participation in the Berklee Summer Jazz Workshop. He attended Berklee College of Music on scholarship, graduating summa cum laude in three years with a B.M. in Professional Music. Post-graduation, he toured with saxophonist Chris Cheek and participated in the 2017 Banff International Workshop in Jazz & Creative Music, where he met vocalist Mingjia Chen.

Fernando's career gained momentum with his debut album *Extended Layover* (2018) alongside Mingjia Chen, followed by solo releases including *The Lonely Sailor* (2019), *Blackbird/Fly* (2021), *The Grind* (2022) with Matt Lagan, *Piano Poetry* (2023), and his sixth album *Philly 3* (2026) with his working trio featuring Dan McCain on bass and Kyon Williams on drums. His style blends jazz with classical counterpoint, bebop, metric modulation, and influences from Erroll Garner, Oscar Peterson, Brad Mehldau, and Tigran Hamasyan, creating virtuosic, humorous, and narrative-driven compositions. He has performed internationally at leading venues, served as Strathmore Artist in Residence (2021/2022), and won first prize at the 2019 West Virginia International Piano Competition in the jazz category.

Currently based in Philadelphia, Fernando is a jazz piano faculty member at Levine Music in Washington, D.C., since 2019, with an active private studio leading masterclasses and workshops. He performs regularly on the DC jazz scene and tours the US and Canada as a solo artist and sideman, praised as a 'prodigiously gifted composer and virtuoso pianist' by critics.
