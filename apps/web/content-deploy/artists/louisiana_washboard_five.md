## Biography
The Louisiana Washboard Five was a studio recording band led by pianist and bandleader Clarence Williams during the 1920s, active primarily in New York City. Clarence Williams, born in Plaquemine, Louisiana, ran away from home at age 12 to join Billy Kersands' Traveling Minstrel Show and later moved to New Orleans, where he worked as a singer and master of ceremonies while shining shoes and doing odd jobs. By the 1920s, he had become one of the most prolific bandleaders on record, forming various groups to capitalize on the jazz and blues scene, including the Louisiana Washboard Five, which featured the washboard as a key rhythmic instrument in its hot jazz style[3][4].

The band's career development centered on recording sessions that showcased Williams' entrepreneurial approach to the burgeoning jazz market. They produced numerous sides emphasizing lively rhythms and blues-oriented music, aligning with the era's demand for danceable hot jazz. Williams used pseudonyms like 'Clarence Williams' Jazz Kings' for hot band recordings and 'Clarence Williams' Washboard Five' (sometimes referred to as Louisiana Washboard Five) for washboard-driven ensembles, reflecting his versatility in studio work during the 1920s and early 1930s[3][4]. Their musical style blended New Orleans jazz influences with Tin Pan Alley songwriting, prioritizing rhythmic drive and novelty effects suited for fox trots and vaudeville.

Though short-lived as a specific ensemble, the Louisiana Washboard Five contributed to Williams' lasting legacy as a pivotal figure in early jazz recording. Williams' groups helped bridge Southern jazz traditions with commercial success in New York, influencing the evolution of hot jazz and blues recordings. His prolific output preserved key styles from the era, though specific disbandment details are sparse[3][4].
