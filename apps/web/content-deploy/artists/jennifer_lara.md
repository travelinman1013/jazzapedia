## Biography
Jennifer Lara was born in 1953 in Kingston, Jamaica, and emerged as a prominent vocalist in the Jamaican music scene during the rocksteady era. At the age of 16, she was introduced to Studio One by session musician Richard Ace, where she began providing backing vocals for major artists including Delroy Wilson, Freddie McGregor, Dennis Brown, and Sugar Minott. Her debut single arrived in 1970, and in 1974, she released her breakthrough solo album *Studio One Presents Jennifer Lara*, produced by Clement 'Coxsone' Dodd, featuring soulful tracks like 'Consider Me,' recorded over the rhythm of Delroy Wilson's hit 'I Don’t Know Why.' Known as Studio One's 'resident harmonist,' Lara's smooth, emotive voice blended American soul influences with Jamaican rocksteady and lovers rock grooves, contributing to the evolution from ska to slower, more danceable styles.[1][3][4]

Lara maintained a prolific association with Studio One spanning over 35 years, appearing on compilations such as *Christmas Greetings*, *Feel Like Jumping*, and *Studio One Classics*. She continued recording into the 1990s and performed as a backing vocalist with groups like The Ethiopians. Her final recording, the duet 'Ordinary People' with Dalton Browne, was made at Studio One just two weeks before her death. Lara passed away on June 11 (or 15), 2005, at age 52 in Kingston Public Hospital from a stroke caused by brain hemorrhage and high blood pressure, survived by her two children, Ika and Sheka (or Cheka).[2][3]

Her legacy endures as a timeless figure in Jamaican music, celebrated for her soulful interpretations that captured the island's musical spirit. Musicologist Bunny Goodison praised her likability and harmonious contributions, while her work remains a staple in rocksteady and lovers rock anthologies.[1][3]
