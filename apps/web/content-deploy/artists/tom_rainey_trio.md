## Biography
Tom Rainey, born on September 17, 1957, in Los Angeles, California, and raised in Santa Barbara after his parents' divorce, began drumming at a young age under his father's guidance, who taught him rudiments and introduced him to early influences like Gene Krupa and Buddy Rich. He played in school bands, rock cover bands during his teens, and attended music camp at the University of the Pacific, where he encountered more advanced musicians. After a brief stint at Berklee College of Music, which he left after four semesters, Rainey returned to the Bay Area for pop gigs before moving to New York City in 1979, where he started with straight-ahead jazz in a trio alongside pianist Kenny Werner and bassist Ratzo Harris.[1][2][3][5]

Rainey's career flourished as a prolific sideman in the New York creative jazz scene, collaborating extensively with saxophonist Tim Berne in bands like Big Satan, Hard Cell, Paraphrase, and Science Friction from the 1990s onward, as well as with Fred Hersch, Tony Malaby, Drew Gress, and others, appearing on nearly 80 recordings over decades. His style evolved from straight-ahead jazz to avant-garde and free improvisation, marked by innovative drumming that supports improvisation and composition. In 2010, after three decades primarily as a sideman, he released his debut as leader, *Pool School* (Clean Feed), featuring his trio with guitarist Mary Halvorson and wife Ingrid Laubrock on saxophone, followed by *Camino Cielo Echo* (Intakt) and later projects like the Obbligato quintet interpreting standards.[1][2][3][4][5]

Rainey's legacy lies in his journeyman role elevating leaders' music through versatile, intuitive playing in experimental jazz contexts, earning him status as an in-demand drummer while reluctantly stepping into leadership, reflecting a deep commitment to collective improvisation over spotlight.[1][2][3]
