## Biography
The Missourians were a mid-western jazz band originating from the Kansas City area, heavily influenced by Bennie Moten's swaggering two-beat style in the 1920s. Initially known as the Cotton Club Orchestra from 1925 to 1927, they performed at New York's Cotton Club under leader Andy Preer. Following Preer's unexpected death in 1927 and Duke Ellington's arrival at the club—which restricted the name to the resident band—the group rebranded as The Missourians, referencing their physical and stylistic Missouri roots, with Lockwood Lewis hired as director, front man, and vocalist.

Under Lewis's leadership, The Missourians toured backing Ethel Waters and secured a residency at Harlem's Savoy Ballroom in 1929, gaining fame as 'the band to beat' in musical battles, reportedly overpowering even Ellington's outfit with their ferocious energy. They recorded 12 sides in New York between June 1929 and February 1930, capturing their hot, riff-driven sound featuring brass fanfares, tight harmonies, and powerful rhythm sections. Key personnel included trumpeters R.Q. Dickerson and Lammar Wright, trombonist De Priest Wheeler, pianist Earres Prince, and saxophonists like William Thornton Blue and George Scott.

In October 1929, they triumphed in a Savoy Ballroom battle against Cab Calloway's Alabamians. After Calloway's success in Broadway's *Hot Chocolates*, he joined The Missourians in early 1930 at the urging of Savoy manager Charles Buchanan, leading the band from 1930 to 1934 and transitioning them into his signature orchestra, cementing their legacy in early jazz and swing.
