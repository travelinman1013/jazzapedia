## Biography
Fela Aníkúlápó Kútì, born Olufela Olusegun Oludotun Ransome-Kuti on October 15, 1938, in Abeokuta, Nigeria, grew up in an upper-middle-class family deeply involved in anti-colonial activism. His mother, Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti, was a prominent feminist and leader of the Abeokuta Women's Riots, while his father, Israel Oludotun Ransome-Kuti, was an Anglican minister, school principal, and first president of the Nigeria Union of Teachers. As a child, Fela learned piano and drums, attended Abeokuta Grammar School, and in 1958 traveled to London ostensibly to study medicine but instead enrolled at Trinity College of Music to study trumpet and classical music. There, he formed the band Koola Lobitos, blending jazz, highlife, and West African styles, and gained experience playing in London clubs.[1][2][5][6][7]

Returning to Nigeria in 1963, Fela reformed Koola Lobitos, worked as a radio producer, and evolved his sound into Afrobeat—a revolutionary fusion of highlife, jazz, funk, and Yoruba traditional music characterized by extended improvisational grooves, dense percussion, and politically charged lyrics in pidgin English and Yoruba. In 1969, after a formative U.S. trip influenced by Black Power and free jazz, he renamed the band Africa '70 (with drummer Tony Allen as musical director) and became a superstar in Nigeria during the 1970s. Fela established the Kalakuta Republic commune in 1970, an independent artist colony that defied military rule, and released over 50 albums critiquing corruption and oppression, earning him repeated arrests, beatings, and raids, including the 1977 army attack that killed his mother.[1][2][4][8]

Fela's activism extended to forming the Movement of the People political party in 1979 and running for president. Jailed in 1984 for 20 months under Muhammadu Buhari and again in 1993 (charges later dropped), he continued performing until his death on August 2, 1997, in Lagos from AIDS-related complications at age 58. His legacy as Afrobeat's pioneer endures, influencing global music while his son Femi carries the tradition forward.[1][2][6]
