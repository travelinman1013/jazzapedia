## Biography
Mark Witt is an indie rock singer-songwriter from Richmond, Virginia, who began his musical journey in his 20s by picking up the guitar and writing songs inspired by artists like Jeff Tweedy, Elliott Smith, and R.E.M. Initially a closet songwriter, he took a two-year hiatus for graduate school but resumed writing after moving to Chicago for his advertising career, where he joined a band, played shows, and self-released two EPs around 2010. Life interruptions, including professional demands and international moves, led to over a decade away from music, during which he rarely touched his guitar.[1]

Returning to his native Richmond, VA, reignited Witt's creativity, prompting him to write dozens of songs. In 2024, motivated by a milestone birthday and new digital recording tools, he set up a home studio in his bedroom and recorded his EP *Infinity Smile*. Collaborating with producer Dan-O Deckleman for mixing and mastering, the EP features an eclectic indie rock sound blending punchy guitar pop, electronic textures, and Americana undertones—bolder and more unpredictable than his earlier work.[1]

Witt's style emphasizes introspective lyrics with upbeat, atmospheric grooves, reflecting his joy in rediscovering music later in life. No information confirms a connection to hardstyle, hardcore, or frenchcore genres listed on Spotify, which may refer to a different artist with a similar name.
