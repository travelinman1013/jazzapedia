## Biography
Simple Minds is a Scottish rock band formed in Glasgow in late 1977, emerging from the short-lived punk band Johnny & The Self-Abusers, which was conceived by Alan Cairnduff on Glasgow's South Side and organized by John Milarky. Founding members Jim Kerr (vocals) and Charlie Burchill (guitar), friends since age eight, recruited schoolmates Brian McGee (drums) and Tony Donald (bass), with Kerr and Burchill doubling on other instruments. After Johnny & The Self-Abusers split on the release day of their single 'Saints And Sinners' in November 1977, Kerr and Burchill renamed the remaining lineup Simple Minds, inspired by a lyric from David Bowie's 'The Jean Genie'. They quickly added keyboardist Mick MacNeil, second guitarist Duncan Barnwell (later replaced), and bassist Derek Forbes, establishing a residency at Glasgow's Mars Bar and building a reputation as an exciting live act with full makeup.[1][2][3][4]

Signed by manager Bruce Findlay to his Zoom Records (with Arista distribution), Simple Minds released their debut album 'Life in a Day' in 1979, featuring 'Chelsea Girl', leaning on influences like Roxy Music while experimenting with electronic textures beyond punk's limitations. Subsequent albums 'Real to Real Cacophony' (1979) and 'Empires and Dance' (1980) earned critical acclaim but modest sales. Their first Virgin single 'The American' reached UK No. 59 in 1981, produced by Steve Hillage, amid lineup changes including McGee's departure due to touring exhaustion. The core quintet of Kerr, Burchill, MacNeil, Forbes, and later drummers solidified their new wave sound blending punk energy, synthesizers, and atmospheric rock.[1][2][3][5]

Simple Minds evolved into stadium rock icons in the 1980s with massive hits, maintaining only Kerr and Burchill as constants through frequent lineup shifts, including departures of MacNeil, Forbes, McGee, Mel Gaynor, and John Giblin. Their legacy endures with ongoing activity, guest musicians for recordings and tours, and recognition as one of Scotland's biggest bands from working-class roots.[3][7]

## Fun Facts
- The band split from Johnny & The Self-Abusers and released their only single 'Saints And Sinners' on the same day in November 1977, with the remaining members immediately forming Simple Minds two weeks later.
- Jim Kerr and Charlie Burchill decided to form a band while hitch-hiking through Europe, confirming their desire to escape Glasgow life amid the 1977 punk explosion.
- Early performances featured full makeup, and they specified 'synthesizer' as a prerequisite when recruiting keyboardist Mick MacNeil.
- Drummer Brian McGee left in 1981 after sessions for 'Sons and Fascination', citing exhaustion from constant touring and a wish for family time.
