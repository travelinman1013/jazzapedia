## Biography
Jacob Pick Bittencourt, known professionally as Jacob do Bandolim ("Mandolin Jacob"), was born on December 14, 1918, in Rio de Janeiro to a Brazilian-Jewish mother and a gentile father.[1] He began his musical journey in elementary school playing harmonica and singing in the choir, but at age 12, frustrated with violin lessons, he switched to the mandolin after receiving one as a gift from his mother's friend.[3] By age 15, he was already performing on Brazilian radio as a self-taught child prodigy, and within a year, he and his band were winning contests judged by renowned choro composers and musicians.[3]

Throughout his career, Jacob maintained a dual professional life, working variously as a pharmacist, insurance salesman, street vendor, and ultimately as a notary public, while simultaneously pursuing music with unwavering dedication.[1] He founded the ensemble "Época de Ouro" (Golden Epoch) in the 1960s, which became his most famous group.[3] From 1949 to 1969, he composed and recorded over 100 compositions that facilitated a major choro revival, helping establish the genre as a central symbol of Brazilian national identity.[2][4] His recording career began in 1947 with Continental Records and continued with RCA Victor from 1949 onward.[3] Jacob died on August 13, 1969, leaving behind a legacy as Brazil's greatest mandolinist and one of the most influential Brazilian composers of the 20th century.[3][4]

Jacob was a perfectionist who elevated choro from its traditionally relaxed folk status to a realm of virtuoso performance, comparable to what Andrés Segovia accomplished for classical guitar worldwide.[3] He rejected the stereotype of the "dishevelled, drunk folk musician" and required his band members to maintain impeccable dress and professional commitment, despite all holding day jobs.[1] His compositions ranged from lyrical melodies like "Noites Cariocas" and "Receita de Samba" to aggressively jazzy pieces like "Assanhado," reminiscent of bebop.[1] Beyond his virtuoso playing and prolific compositions, Jacob dedicated himself to researching and preserving the older choro tradition and other Brazilian music styles.[1]
