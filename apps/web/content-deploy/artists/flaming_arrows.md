## Biography
Flaming Arrows is a Mardi Gras Indian tribe based in New Orleans, Louisiana, known for their participation in the city's rich tradition of Mardi Gras Indian culture. The tribe gained prominence in the 1990s under the leadership of Big Chief Kevin Goodman, who revitalized and reformed the group to continue the centuries-old tradition of costume-making and street performances. The Flaming Arrows represent one of several active tribes in New Orleans, competing alongside groups like the Wild Magnolias and Young Keepers of the Flame during Mardi Gras celebrations.

Musically, Flaming Arrows blend traditional Second Line Jazz with contemporary influences, incorporating complex and hypnotic percussion played on tambourines as they parade through New Orleans neighborhoods. The tribe's sound reflects the broader evolution of Mardi Gras Indian music, which has incorporated funk, brass band music, and hip-hop elements since the 1970s. Under Goodman's leadership, the Flaming Arrows have achieved significant recognition, recording their debut album 'Here Come The Indians Now' in 1997 and performing at major venues including the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival. The group's legacy extends beyond music into film and cultural documentation, with appearances in documentaries such as 'What You Gonna Do When The World Is On Fire' and 'Walking Down Claiborne,' as well as performances on Austin City Limits and WWOZ radio.
