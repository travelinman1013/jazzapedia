## Biography
Mercadonegro, often stylized as Mercado Negro, is a prominent salsa band based in Switzerland, recognized as one of Europe's leading salsa groups. Founded by Cuban lead singer and songwriter José Armando Miranda (born 1974 in Havana, Cuba), Peruvian pianist and musical director Cesar Correa (born 1975 in Trujillo, Peru), and Colombian percussionist Rodrigo Rodríguez (born 1974 in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia), the band blends timba, salsa, cha cha cha, and son cubano. Miranda, who began his professional career at age 17 after studying at Havana's Felix Varela Professional Music School, met his bandmates through violinist Alfredo de la Fé. Their debut album was released in 2002 by Bibomusic, following successful performances at major European Latin venues like El Cubanito.[1][4][7]

The group's career gained momentum in the early 2000s with strategic participations in high-profile events and recordings featuring guest artists like Alfredo de la Fé and Tony Martinez. They became part of the New York Salsa All Stars project alongside Giovanni Hidalgo, Jimmy Bosch, and others, and shared stages with legends such as Celia Cruz (with whom they worked for three consecutive years), Tito Nieves, Cheo Feliciano, and Eddie Palmieri, whom they idolize. Known for their high-energy performances and compositions celebrating life, love, and Cuban culture, Mercadonegro has toured extensively across Europe and beyond, exuding vibrant Latin rhythms while maintaining a multinational lineup from Colombia, Peru, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Switzerland, and Italy.[1][4][6]

Mercadonegro's legacy lies in revitalizing salsa dura in Europe, with an impressive roster of collaborations that bridge classic salsa icons and modern talents. Their music stands out for its authentic Afro-Cuban roots combined with contemporary flair, earning them a reputation among connoisseurs and invitations to prestigious venues like Ronnie Scott's in London and New Morning in Paris.[1][6]
