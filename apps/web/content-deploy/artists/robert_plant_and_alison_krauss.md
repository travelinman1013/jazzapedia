## Biography
Robert Plant & Alison Krauss is a collaborative duo formed by English rock legend Robert Plant, born in 1948 in West Bromwich, England, and American bluegrass artist Alison Krauss, born July 23, 1971, in Decatur, Illinois. Plant rose to fame as the lead vocalist of Led Zeppelin in the late 1960s after early bands like Band of Joy, while Krauss began playing fiddle at age five, winning contests and releasing her debut album at 16 in 1987, sparking renewed interest in bluegrass through her work with Union Station.[1][2][3][4] Their partnership began in 2004 at a Lead Belly tribute and solidified in 2007 with the album *Raising Sand*, produced by T Bone Burnett, blending rock, blues, folk, and Americana in haunting vocal harmonies that earned platinum status and six Grammy Awards, including Album and Record of the Year.[1][2][3][5][6]

The duo's musical style fuses Plant's emotive rock vocals with Krauss's pristine bluegrass fiddle and singing, creating lush roots-music interpretations of songs by artists like Gene Clark, Townes Van Zandt, and Merle Haggard. After a 14-year gap, they released *Raise the Roof* in 2021, featuring tracks like “High and Lonesome” and earning critical acclaim with global tours and live streams from Nashville.[2][3][4][6] Their work has bridged genres, introducing Plant to Americana and elevating Krauss's profile beyond bluegrass.[5]

Their legacy includes redefining cross-genre collaboration, with *Raising Sand* hailed as one of the 21st century's most acclaimed albums. Plant's post-Led Zeppelin explorations and Krauss's 27 Grammy wins (fifth all-time as of 2025) underscore their influence, proving an 'unlikely pairing' can yield enduring success.[1][3][6]
