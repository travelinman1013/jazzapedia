## Biography
Vorris 'Shorty' LeBlanc, born on December 24, 1923, in Lake Arthur, Louisiana, grew up in a large family of nine children where nearly all members played instruments. His father, Jules LeBlanc, was a noted accordionist who performed regularly at fais do-dos, traditional Cajun dance events, and introduced Shorty to music from an early age. After serving in the Army during World War II, Shorty married Ruby McGee and worked as a machine shop worker while leading several bands and developing his skills as an accordionist in the Cajun music scene.[1][5]

LeBlanc's career gained prominence in the late 1950s and early 1960s through recordings with Goldband Records, founded by producer Eddie Shuler. He was a key member of Cleveland Crochet and the Hillbilly Ramblers, playing accordion on the hit 'Sugar Bee' (1960), which reached high on the charts and blended Cajun traditions with rock 'n' roll backbeat, steel guitar, and English vocals for broader appeal. His style featured driving accordion solos reminiscent of blues harmonica, contributing to the track's zydeco-bluesy color. Shorty also recorded under his own name and backed country artists like Jimmy C. Newman, allowing him to earn a living from music for a few years.[1][2][3][6][7]

Shorty LeBlanc died of cancer on May 25, 1965, at the age of 42, leaving a legacy in southwest Louisiana's Cajun and emerging zydeco music. Active from the 1940s to 1960s, his contributions helped bridge traditional Cajun sounds with R&B and country influences during Goldband's wave of local success.[1][3][5]
