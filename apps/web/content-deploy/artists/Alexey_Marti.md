## Biography
Alexey Marti is a Cuban-born percussionist, composer, and bandleader who has become a prominent figure in New Orleans' Latin jazz scene. Born in Havana, Cuba, Marti began playing conga drums as a child within his family environment, learning African traditions passed down through generations. At age 16, he began formal percussion studies under Maestro Oscar Valdes, the percussionist and singer for the renowned Cuban group Irakere, which led to a tenured position as percussionist for Valdes' Afro-Cuban ensemble, Dia.kara. Marti's early education was complemented by self-directed study, rehearsing 10-12 hours daily and witnessing rehearsals of Irakere members, absorbing the nuances of Afro-Cuban fusion music.

In 2008, at age 16, Marti made a transformative decision to relocate to New Orleans, Louisiana, to advance his musical aspirations. He enrolled in the University of New Orleans Jazz Program, pursuing a Bachelor's degree in music with a concentration in percussion and piano. During this period, he founded Alexey Marti and Urban Minds, one of New Orleans' in-demand Latin-funk-fusion quintets, which opened for world-renowned pianist Chucho Valdes in 2012. Marti has been a featured regular at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival since 2009 and received three nominations for the New Orleans Big Easy Music Award in Latin and World music categories (2014-2018), winning best performer in 2018.

Marti's musical output reflects his cosmopolitan approach to composition and arrangement. He has released two acclaimed albums: Travesia (2017) and Mundo (2019), both showcasing his ability to blend Cuban folkloric traditions, West African bata drumming, and American jazz, blues, funk, and second-line influences. His work extends beyond performance and recording; he has served as a percussionist for digital media and films, including the TV series Roots (2016) and as film composer for documentaries such as Chasing Dreams: A Leah Chase Story and Codigo Color Memorias. His most recent album, Louisiana Stories, was released in 2025 on I/R Records.
