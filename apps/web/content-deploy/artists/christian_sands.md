## Biography
Christian Sylvester Sands was born on May 22, 1989, in New Haven, Connecticut, where he grew up in a musically rich environment that shaped his artistic foundation.[5][6] He began piano lessons at approximately three years old after a family friend and church music director recognized his potential and encouraged his parents to enroll him in formal training.[5][7] By age seven, he was performing professionally at various venues, and by his early teens, he had become a protégé of renowned jazz educator Dr. Billy Taylor, from whom he also took lessons alongside studying with Dave Brubeck.[3] Church music proved instrumental in developing his sound, with Sunday services establishing the tonal foundation that would characterize his later work.[7]

Sands' professional career accelerated significantly when he joined bassist Christian McBride's trio and Inside Straight Quartet, serving as the pianist for six years and touring throughout the world's finest venues.[2][3] In 2016, he was signed to the prestigious Mack Avenue Records label, and his debut album *Reach* was released in April 2017, holding the #1 spot on the Jazz Chart for four weeks.[2] Since then, he has released multiple acclaimed albums including the GRAMMY-nominated *Be Water* (2020), *Christmas Stories* (2023), and *Embracing Dawn*, establishing himself as one of the most sought-after pianists in contemporary jazz.[1][2][4] Recognized as a Steinway Artist since 2012, Sands has received five Grammy Award nominations and was named a "jazz star of the future" by Wynton Marsalis.[2][3]

Sands' musical language is distinctly his own, blending agile post-bop with soulful bluesy tinges, gorgeous string orchestrations, and elements of prog rock, gospel, and Western classical music.[1][4] His stylistic range encompasses stride piano, swing, bebop, progressive jazz, fusion, Brazilian, and Afro-Cuban styles.[2] His approach to composition and performance is deeply informed by his mentors Christian McBride and Dr. Billy Taylor—the former teaching him the importance of authenticity, the latter emphasizing the necessity of connecting jazz to a wide-ranging audience.[1][4] In recognition of his contributions to jazz, Sands received the Duke Ellington Medal from Yale School of Music, marking him as the 63rd recipient of this prestigious honor since 1972.[6]
