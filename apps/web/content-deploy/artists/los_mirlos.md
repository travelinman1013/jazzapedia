## Biography
Los Mirlos, named after a black bird native to their jungle homeland, originated in Moyobamba, Peru, in 1972, when two brothers and their cousin from the jungle town moved to Lima during the oil boom of the 1970s.[1][2][7] The band was signed by the label Infopesta and quickly became pioneers of cumbia amazónica (psychedelic cumbia), a uniquely Peruvian variant that blends traditional Andean-Amazonian cumbia rhythms with psychedelic rock-inspired guitar riffs, surf music elements, and soul and jazz-rock influences.[1][2][4] Under the direction of founder Jorge Rodríguez Grández, Los Mirlos created an innovative sound that celebrated the culture and natural soundscape of the Peruvian Amazon, with most songs beginning with a bird whistle as homage to their origins.[1]

Throughout their 50+ year career, Los Mirlos have maintained a rotating lineup while producing an extraordinary catalog of over 33 studio albums, 27 LPs, 88 singles and EPs, and 16 compilation appearances.[1][3] In the 1980s, they became the first Peruvian group to travel internationally, performing in Argentina and eventually conquering audiences across Mexico, Bolivia, Colombia, Canada, Germany, and the United States, with their music reaching 180 countries by 2024.[5] The band's international breakthrough accelerated significantly after 2007, when the U.S. label Barbès Records released *The Roots of Chicha*, a compilation featuring Los Mirlos' classics "Sonido amazónico" and "La danza de Los Mirlos," which exposed their music to underground communities and young listeners worldwide.[5] In 2025, Los Mirlos made history as the first Peruvian band to perform at the Coachella Music Festival, cementing their status as essential figures in Peruvian musical culture and global psychedelic cumbia.[3][5]

Los Mirlos are celebrated as the uncrowned kings of tropical Peruvian Cumbia and masterminds of the psychedelic Amazonian sound, known for their prodigious output, tenacity, and ability to blend traditional Amazonian music with avant-garde psychedelia.[1][2][4] Their influence extends beyond dance music, transcending genre barriers and inspiring modern psychedelic cumbia groups while maintaining their relevance with contemporary audiences seeking to explore new musical textures and discover the origins of this unique genre.[4][5]
