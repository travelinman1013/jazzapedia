## Biography
David Lewis Hamilton (January 15, 1920 – August 9, 1994) was an American R&B, jazz, and funk musician and record producer who spent most of his career in Detroit, Michigan. Born in Savannah, Georgia, Hamilton moved to Detroit as a child and developed early musical proficiency, experimenting with piano at age five and later mastering guitar, vibraphone, and xylophone. In the late 1930s, he toured with the Helen Pennilton Quartet, and by the 1940s had formed his own band, the Noc-Tunes, which recorded for the Sensation label. Throughout the 1950s, he worked as a session musician and recorded with vocal groups including the Peppers on the Checker label.

Hamilton became a key figure in Detroit's Motown Records ecosystem during the early 1960s, playing on landmark recordings including Jackie Wilson's "Reet Petite" (1957) and "Lonely Teardrops" (1958), as well as Mary Wells' "My Guy" (1964). He was among the select studio musicians at Motown to receive his own LP release, recording the instrumental album *Blue Vibrations* (1963) on the Workshop Jazz imprint, which showcased his vibraphone work alongside Hammond organ accompaniment. Though accounts differ regarding his formal status within the legendary Funk Brothers house band, Hamilton's contributions to Motown's signature sound were substantial and widely respected.

After Motown phased him out in the mid-1960s, Hamilton established his own record labels—Tempo, Topper, and later TCB and Demoristic—and founded the Da Da recording studio in 1965 with songwriter Darrell Goolsby. During the late 1960s and 1970s, he recorded diverse material including gospel and funk, much of which remained unreleased during his lifetime. Hamilton's legacy experienced a significant revival in the 1980s when British Northern Soul enthusiasts rediscovered his recordings, leading to reissues by Kent and Ace Records. After his death in 1994, researcher Ady Croasdell compiled his archives into multiple CD releases, cementing Hamilton's recognition as both a talented musician and highly respected producer.

## Fun Facts
- Hamilton began musical training remarkably early, experimenting on piano at just five years old and progressing to banjo and ukulele by age fifteen before settling on guitar as his primary instrument.
- Despite being a crucial session musician on some of Motown's biggest hits, Hamilton was one of only a select few studio musicians to receive his own LP release on a Motown imprint, making *Blue Vibrations* (1963) a rare honor.
- Hamilton's music was largely forgotten until the 1980s when British Northern Soul enthusiasts rediscovered his recordings, sparking a renaissance that led to multiple CD reissues decades after his original recordings.
- Hamilton was a multi-instrumentalist entrepreneur who not only played guitar and vibraphone but also established multiple record labels (Tempo, Topper, TCB, Demoristic) and owned his own recording studio (Da Da), making him a rare musician-producer-businessman of his era.
