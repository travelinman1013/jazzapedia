## Biography
The Lowest Pair is an American folk duo formed in 2013, consisting of banjoists and vocalists Kendl Winter and Palmer T. Lee. Kendl Winter, born and raised in Arkansas, was drawn to the Pacific Northwest's music scene in Olympia, Washington, where she released three solo albums on K Records and performed in folk and punk bands. Palmer T. Lee, a Minnesota native, built his first banjo at age 19 from inherited parts and fronted Minneapolis string bands. The two first met in 2009 at a bluegrass festival while in separate bands, reconnected through festivals and Facebook, and officially formed the duo in 2013 after Lee visited Washington, discovering their exceptional vocal harmonies and banjo chemistry.[1][2][3]

Their debut album, *36¢* (2014), was recorded in Minnesota with help from Dave Simonett of Trampled By Turtles, adapting their solo material into duets. They followed with *The Sacred Heart Sessions* (2015), recorded in a Duluth church, emphasizing collaborative songwriting, and released additional albums including *Uncertain as It Is Uneven* (2016), *Fern Girl And Ice Man* (2016), *The Perfect Plan* (2020), and *Always As Young As We’ll Ever Be* (recently produced by Tucker Martine). Known for double banjo arrangements blended with guitar, their style draws from bluegrass, old-time, southern gothic, americana, and indie folk, delivering stark lyricism and heartstring-tugging narratives while avoiding strict genre mimicry.[1][3][4][5]

Over the years, The Lowest Pair has relentlessly toured North America and the UK, playing over 500 shows, building a reputation as an under-the-radar americana duo with a focus on intimate, string-driven sounds that have evolved to include expanded instrumentation and collaborators.[2][5]
