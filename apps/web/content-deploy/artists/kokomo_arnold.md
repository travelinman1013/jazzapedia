## Biography
James 'Kokomo' Arnold, born on February 15, 1896 or 1901 in Lovejoy's Station, Georgia, learned the basics of guitar from his cousin John Wiggs. He worked as a farmhand in Buffalo, New York, and a steelworker in Pittsburgh before moving to Chicago in 1929, where he ran a bootlegging business until Prohibition ended in 1933. His first recordings came in 1930 under the pseudonym Gitfiddle Jim for Victor in Memphis, with 'Rainy Night Blues' and 'Paddlin' Madeline Blues,' showcasing his powerful left-handed slide guitar and rapid vocal style.[1][2]

Arnold's career peaked from 1934 to 1938 with Decca Records, producing 88 sides after Kansas Joe McCoy introduced him to producer Mayo Williams. Hits like 'Old Original Kokomo Blues'—a cover of Scrapper Blackwell's song that earned him his nickname—and 'Milk Cow Blues' defined his intense country blues style, distinct for its slide technique and fast delivery. He was a prominent figure in Chicago blues alongside Peetie Wheatstraw and Bumble Bee Slim, but quit music in 1938 for factory work.[1][2]

Rediscovered in 1962 amid the blues revival, Arnold declined to return to performing. He died of a heart attack on November 8, 1968, in Chicago, buried in Burr Oak Cemetery, Alsip, Illinois. His legacy endures through covers by artists like Robert Johnson, Elvis Presley, and others, cementing his influence on blues and rock.[1][2]

## Fun Facts
- Recorded under the name Gitfiddle Jim for his 1930 debut, with 'Paddlin' Madeline Blues' played so fast his voice struggled to keep up.[2]
- His 1934 'Sissy Man Blues' featured lyrics about bisexuality, later covered by Josh White as 'Pinewood Tom'.[1]
- Viewed music as secondary to bootlegging, quitting after Prohibition ended and later rejecting a 1960s blues revival comeback.[1][2]
- 'Milk Cow Blues' was covered by diverse artists including The Kinks (1965), Aerosmith (1977), and Willie Nelson (2000).[1]
