## Biography
Charles Aznavour, born Shahnour Vaghinag Aznavourian on May 22, 1924, in Paris, France, to Armenian immigrant parents Mischa Aznavourian and Knar Baghdasaryan, grew up in a family of artists who had fled the Armenian Genocide. His father was a singer and restaurateur, and his mother a seamstress and actress, instilling in him a passion for performance from an early age. Aznavour left school at nine to pursue acting and dancing, debuting on stage in 1933 at the Théâtre du Petit Monde and appearing in plays like 'Margot' in 1935. As a teenager, he danced in nightclubs, sold newspapers to fund lessons, and formed the duet 'Roche and Aznavour' with Pierre Roche in 1942, writing lyrics and performing across France.[1][2][3][4][5]

In the 1940s, Aznavour transitioned to music, mentored by Édith Piaf, who discovered him, toured with him, and helped refine his songwriting and unique raspy vibrato tenor voice—overcoming early criticisms of his appearance and vocal cord paralysis. His breakthrough came in 1956 with 'Sur Ma Vie' at the Olympia, launching a career spanning over 85 years with 1,400 songs in nine languages, 91 albums, and over 200 million records sold. He also acted in films like 'La Tête contre les Murs' (1959), earning awards, and later became a diplomat, gaining Armenian citizenship in 2008 and co-founding the Aznavour Foundation in 2016 with his son Nicolas.[1][3][4][5]

Aznavour's style blended **chanson**, **variété française**, and **French jazz**, known for emotive lyrics on love, loss, and life, performed worldwide until his death on October 1, 2018, at age 94. His legacy endures as one of France's most iconic singer-songwriters, with enduring hits like 'She' (1974) and global influence bridging French and Armenian cultures.[1][3][4]

- Aznavour claimed no relation to Charles Aznavour the chef, joking his grandfather cooked for the Czar in Tiflis, Georgia.
