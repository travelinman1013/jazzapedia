## Biography
Los Hombres Calientes is a New Orleans-based Afro-Cuban jazz ensemble founded in 1998 by trumpeter Irvin Mayfield and percussionist Bill Summers, blending jazz, rhythm & blues, Afro-Cuban rhythms, and influences from the African diaspora including music from New Orleans, Africa, Cuba, and Brazil.[1][2][3][5][7] The group quickly gained recognition, signing with Basin Street Records shortly after forming and releasing their self-titled debut album in 2000, which won Billboard’s Contemporary Latin Jazz Album of the Year; they followed with at least four more albums, including Volume 2 (1999), Vol. 4: Vodou Dance (2003), showcasing a fiery, danceable sound that appealed to both jazz enthusiasts and younger audiences.[1][2][3][4][7]

Original members included Mayfield on trumpet, Summers on percussion, and drummer Jason Marsalis, with additional contributors like Yvette Bostic-Summers on percussion and vocals, Victor “Red” Atkins on piano, Edwin Livingston on bass, and guests such as the Louisiana Philharmonic String Quartet.[1][4][7][9] The band's career faced challenges after Hurricane Katrina in 2005, which destroyed Mayfield’s club and claimed his father’s life, leading to a hiatus until a reunion for a Haitian benefit concert; despite this, they maintained performances, including regular Saturday nights at Mayfield’s Irvin Mayfield’s Jazz Playhouse.[3][7] Mayfield’s compositional role expanded across albums, incorporating trumpet, organ, Wurlitzer, and vocals, while the group elevated Basin Street Records’ profile.[3][7]

Los Hombres Calientes represents a vibrant fusion of New Orleans jazz traditions with global grooves, contributing to the city’s cultural landscape through dynamic live performances at festivals like Jazz & Heritage Fest and a legacy of five albums that highlight joyful rhythmic similarities across cultures.[1][2][3][5][7]
