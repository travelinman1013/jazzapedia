## Biography
Marva Whitney, born Marva Ann Manning on May 1, 1944, in Kansas City, Kansas, began her musical journey at age three touring with her family's gospel group, the Manning Gospel Singers. By her teens, she sang with the Alma Whitney Singers, married Harry Olander Whitney (with whom she had a daughter, Sherrie), and started performing R&B in 1963 while working at a garment factory and studying music at college. In the mid-1960s, she became lead singer of local group Tommy (Gadson) & The Derbys, opening for major acts in Kansas City, before turning down tours with Bobby Bland and Little Richard to join James Brown's Revue in 1967 as a featured vocalist, earning her the title 'Soul Sister #1' for her raw, brassy funk style.[1][2][3]

Whitney's career peaked with Brown, who produced her singles like the funky 'Unwind Yourself' (1968) and hits 'Things Got To Get Better (Get Together)' (R&B #22) and 'I Made A Mistake' (R&B #32), plus albums including Unwind Yourself (1968), Live and Lowdown at the Apollo, and It's My Thing (1969). After leaving Brown in 1969-1970 due to exhaustion, she recorded for T-Neck and Forte Records, notably 'Daddy Don't Know About Sugar Bear,' but largely retired to local Kansas City gigs. In the 1980s, she joined Coffee, Cream & Sugar and JB Allstars with ex-Brown bandmates, later marrying a preacher and returning to gospel.[1][2]

A late-career revival came in 2006 collaborating with DJ Pari and Osaka Monaurail on 'I Am What I Am,' leading to tours in Japan and Europe. She suffered a stroke on stage in Australia in 2009 but recovered partially for 2010 shows, passing away on December 22, 2012, from pneumonia complications at age 68. Whitney's powerful vocals and James Brown-era funk cemented her legacy as a funk pioneer with a cult following.[1][2]
