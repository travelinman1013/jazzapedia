## Biography
Everton Dennis Williams, known professionally as Everton Blender, was born on November 21, 1954 in Clarendon parish, Jamaica, though he grew up in Kingston 13 on Maxfield Avenue. Before pursuing music full-time, he worked as a painter, construction worker, and decorator, but realized that the harsh chemicals in these professions were damaging his voice and health. With spiritual conviction, he left his job to pursue singing, meeting his future wife Phyllis Thompson in 1980 and relocating back to Clarendon. His early musical journey began when he entered an amateur contest at the Bohemia Club performing a Dennis Brown song under the stage name Babaroo, and after winning on his second attempt, he began performing with the Destiny Sound System.

Blender's path to commercial success was lengthy and challenging. Though he released several singles in the late 1970s and 1980s, including "Where His Love" (1979) and "Baba Black Sheep" (1985), he struggled to achieve significant commercial traction and withdrew from music for nearly a decade. His breakthrough came in 1991 when he recorded the autobiographical "Create a Sound," which described his experiences in the music business and his Rastafarian faith. Released in 1992 on the Star Trail label, this song marked his first hit. His early success on Star Trail led to additional hits including "Blend Dem," "World Corruption," "Bob Marley," and "Piece of the Blender," establishing him as a rising force in reggae.

By the mid-1990s, Blender took control of his career by founding Blend Dem Productions, financing most of his own recordings—a decision that heightened tensions with industry gatekeepers but ultimately strengthened his artistic independence. His 1999 album Rootsman Credential showcased his signature blend of roots and dancehall reggae with conscious, spiritually-driven lyrics. Subsequent albums including Visionary (2001) and King Man (2003) featured collaborations with prominent artists and demonstrated his versatility, with King Man notably recorded entirely with live instruments including a full horn section, harking back to reggae's 1970s golden era. Since the late 1990s, Blender has established himself as one of Jamaica's top touring forces, performing extensively throughout the United States, Europe, and the Caribbean, and is recognized for his distinctive tenor vocals, up-tempo arrangements, and inspirational themes that bridge roots reggae and dancehall styles.
