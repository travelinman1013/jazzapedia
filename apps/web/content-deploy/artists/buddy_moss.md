## Biography
Eugene 'Buddy' Moss (January 16, 1914 – October 19, 1984) was born in Jewell, a small town in Warren County, Georgia, and began his musical journey on the harmonica. At age 16, he was noticed by Atlanta blues musicians Curley Weaver and Robert 'Barbecue Bob' Hicks, who brought him into their group, the Georgia Cotton Pickers, for his recording debut on December 7, 1930, at the Campbell Hotel in Atlanta, where he played harmonica on four tracks for Columbia Records.[1][2][3] Over the next few years, Moss taught himself guitar, developing a distinctive Piedmont blues style influenced by ragtime, with swinging bass rhythms and hammering techniques, and began performing with Hicks until Hicks' death from pneumonia in 1931.[2][3][4]

By January 1933, Moss made his solo recording debut for the American Record Corporation in New York, accompanied by Fred McMullen and Curley Weaver, releasing 11 songs that showcased his growing prowess as a guitarist and singer. He became one of the most prolific and popular Atlanta-based blues artists of the 1930s, recording over 60 tracks for labels like Okeh and Columbia between 1933 and 1935, often with collaborators like Weaver, Blind Willie McTell, and Josh White, outselling peers at his peak.[1][2][3][4] His career was interrupted in 1935 by a prison sentence—reportedly for murdering his wife or a fatal fight with a rival—lasting until 1941, after which he recorded sparingly with Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee before World War II halted opportunities; he then worked odd jobs like elevator operator and truck driver.[3][4]

Rediscovered in 1964 after encountering Josh White at an Emory University concert, Moss performed at folk festivals including Newport in 1966 and Atlanta Blues and Grass Roots in 1976, with some unissued Columbia sessions, though his difficult personality limited further recordings. He died in Atlanta in 1984, largely forgotten again, but reissues by Biograph and Document Records have since elevated his legacy as a key East Coast blues guitarist bridging Blind Blake and Blind Boy Fuller eras.[2][3][4]

## Fun Facts
- Moss was imprisoned around 1935 for either murdering his wife or fatally fighting a rival, depending on accounts, and released in 1941 partly due to a recommendation from Blind Boy Fuller's manager James Baxter Long.[4]
- In 1964, Moss spontaneously visited Josh White backstage at an Emory University concert, leading to his rediscovery by folk enthusiasts and festival performances.[3][4]
- Despite immense talent, Moss' 'difficult personality' prevented further recordings during the 1960s blues revival, even after persuasion attempts.[3]
- His 1934 solo records outsold those of established peers like Curley Weaver and Blind Willie McTell across Southern states.[3]
