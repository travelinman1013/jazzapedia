## Biography
Me First and the Gimme Gimmes (often shortened to the Gimmes) is a punk rock supergroup and cover band formed in 1995 in San Francisco, California, United States, by members of prominent punk bands including NOFX, Lagwagon, Foo Fighters, and others. Initially conceived as a themed 7-inch singles project, the band debuted with their first live performance on April 20, 1996, at the Chameleon Club in San Francisco. Their studio core features Spike Slawson on lead vocals, Fat Mike (NOFX) on bass, Joey Cape (Lagwagon) on guitar and backing vocals, Dave Raun (Lagwagon) on drums, and rotating guitarists such as Chris Shiflett (Foo Fighters, 1995-2019) and John Reis. The group specializes in high-energy punk covers of songs from diverse genres spanning the 1950s to 1990s, including pop, show tunes, country, Motown, and Japanese pop, delivered with humor and theatrical flair.[1][2][3][8]

The band's career evolved from their 1997 debut album *Have a Ball*—featuring covers like 'All My Lovin'' and 'Wild World'—to subsequent releases such as *Are a Drag* (1999, show tunes), *Blow in the Wind* (2001), *Take a Break* (2003, R&B/metal), *Have Another Ball* (country), and live albums like *Ruin Johnny's Bar Mitzvah* (2004) and *¡Sing-Along!* (2023, recorded at a Quinceañera). Known for their lighthearted, self-entertaining approach, performances feature onstage tiki bars for cocktails, themed costumes (e.g., cheerleaders, drag from musicals, Hawaiian shirts, cowboys), and playful antics, setting them apart in the punk scene. Spike Slawson, recruited by Fat Mike, brings a crooning style influenced by his Pittsburgh upbringing, violin training, and early jobs in music distribution.[1][2][3][4]

Their legacy endures as punk's premier cover band, having released over 11 albums and countless singles, influencing the punk community's appreciation for irreverent genre mashups. Operating as a flexible supergroup, members prioritize main band schedules, with substitutes like C.J. Ramone, Jake Kiley, and Pinch ensuring constant touring. Genres like ska punk, punk, skate punk, and ska align with their high-speed, melodic covers, maintaining a popularity score of 48 on Spotify.[1][2][6]
