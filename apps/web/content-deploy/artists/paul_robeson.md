## Biography
Paul Robeson was born on April 9, 1898, in Princeton, New Jersey, to Reverend William Drew Robeson, a former slave who became a minister, and Maria Louisa Bustill, from a prominent Quaker family involved in African-American civil rights. The youngest of five children, Robeson faced early tragedy with his mother's death in a fire in 1904 and family hardships amid racial constraints. Excelling academically and athletically, he attended Rutgers College on scholarship, graduating as valedictorian in 1919, earning All-American football honors twice, and joining Phi Beta Kappa. He later attended Columbia Law School while playing professional football and coaching, but shifted from law due to racial discrimination.[1][2][5][7]

Robeson's career in performing arts ignited during the Harlem Renaissance. Discovered while acting in Eugene O'Neill's 'The Emperor Jones' in 1924, where he sang a spiritual instead of whistling, he launched a musical career highlighted by his deep bass-baritone voice. Partnering with pianist Lawrence Brown, he performed African-American spirituals, folk songs, and classics like 'Ol' Man River' from 'Show Boat' (1928), pioneering full concerts of Black music for white audiences. His acting triumphs included the title role in Shakespeare's 'Othello' in London (1930), making him an international star in theater, film, and music, releasing over 276 recordings from 1925 to 1961 spanning spirituals, Americana, classical, and political songs.[1][3][4][7]

A committed activist against racism, colonialism, and fascism, Robeson's political stances led to U.S. government persecution during the McCarthy era, including passport revocation from 1950-1958. His legacy endures as a multifaceted icon—singer, actor, athlete, scholar, and human rights advocate—posthumously honored with a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1998. He died in 1976, remembered for elevating Black culture globally.[1][3][5]
