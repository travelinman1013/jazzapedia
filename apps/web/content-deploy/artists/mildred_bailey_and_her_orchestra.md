## Biography
Mildred Bailey, born Mildred Eleanor Rinker on February 27, 1907 (though some sources cite 1900 or 1903), grew up on the Coeur d'Alene Indian Reservation in Tekoa, Washington, with her mother Josephine, a member of the Coeur d'Alene tribe. She began her career singing in speakeasies and on West Coast radio, including KMTR, before her brother Al Rinker and Bing Crosby introduced her to Paul Whiteman in 1929. Bailey became the first featured female vocalist in a big band with Whiteman's orchestra through 1932, recording hits like 'Rockin' Chair,' which earned her the nickname 'The Rockin' Chair Lady' or 'Mrs. Swing.' Her style blended jazz phrasing influenced by Bessie Smith, Ethel Waters, and Louis Armstrong with a high, clear soprano voice.[1][2][3][6]

After leaving Whiteman over salary disputes, Bailey married xylophonist Red Norvo in 1933, forming the duo 'Mr. and Mrs. Swing.' She recorded with ensembles like the Casa Loma Orchestra, Dorsey Brothers, and Benny Goodman's studio band, and joined Norvo's band full-time in 1936, producing tracks such as 'Smoke Dreams' and 'Darn That Dream.' Bailey hosted her own CBS radio series in 1944 and performed at New York nightclubs like Café Society into the late 1940s, despite health struggles with diabetes.[2][3][4][5]

Health issues led to hospitalizations in 1938, 1943, and 1949, forcing her retirement to a farm in Poughkeepsie, New York, where she died of heart failure on December 12, 1951, at age 44. Posthumously inducted into the Big Band and Jazz Hall of Fame in 1989, she was honored with a U.S. Postal Service stamp in 1994, cementing her legacy as a pioneering female big band vocalist who influenced jazz phrasing and integration of women in bands.[3][6][7]
