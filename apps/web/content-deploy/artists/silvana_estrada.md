# Silvana Estrada

## Biography
Silvana Estrada is a Mexican musician and songwriter born on April 15, 1997, in Coatepec, Veracruz, to parents who were both luthiers. She began playing music at a young age and was accepted into a jazz program at Universidad Veracruzana in Xalapa at age 16. While studying jazz, she discovered the Venezuelan cuatro—a small guitar with a warm sound—which became her primary instrument after struggling to connect with piano for songwriting. This instrument would become central to her distinctive musical identity, allowing her to explore the rolling variations of her vocal style.

Estrada's professional career began when she met American musician Charlie Hunter at a jazz seminar where she performed her compositions. This meeting led to her first collaborative album, *Lo Sagrado* (2017), recorded at her parents' cabin in Coatepec. She continued collaborating with Hunter on a second album in 2018 and released the EP *Primeras Canciones* that same year. In 2020, she became the first Latin American artist signed to Glassnote Records, a significant milestone that elevated her international profile. Her debut solo album, *Marchita* (2022), produced by Gustavo Guerrero, received critical acclaim and won her the Latin Grammy Award for Best New Artist (shared with Angela Alvarez) at the 23rd Annual Latin Grammy Awards. The album, born from her first love and subsequent heartbreak, explores themes of withering and renewal. She has since released *Vendrán Suaves Lluvias* (2025) and performed extensively internationally, including three dates at Walt Disney Concert Hall with the Los Angeles Philharmonic as part of the "Canto en Resistencia" series.

Estrada's musical style is genre-bending, rooted in Mexican son jarocho and baroque choir traditions while informed by her jazz training. She dismisses musical trends in favor of a personal, poetic approach that melds North and Latin American traditions with African-influenced elements. Called "one of Mexico's greatest young talents and vocalists" by KCRW's José Galvan, she represents a movement of independent female artists in Latin Alternative music. Her work is characterized by emotional transparency and linguistic authenticity—she performs exclusively in Spanish, allowing her music to transcend language barriers through its universal emotional resonance.

## Fun Facts
- Estrada's parents were both luthiers (instrument makers), which deeply influenced her musical foundation and connection to handcrafted instruments, particularly the Venezuelan cuatro that became her signature instrument.
- She was the first Spotify Mexico 'EQUAL' artist and was spotlighted in Apple Mexico's 'Up Next' program, recognizing her as an emerging talent in the Latin music landscape.
- When signed to Glassnote Records in 2020, she became the first Latin American artist ever signed to the American label, breaking new ground for Latin artists in the U.S. music industry.
- Her album *Marchita* was nominated for Best Singer-Songwriter Album at the 2022 Latin Grammy Awards and later nominated for Album of the Year at the 2023 Rolling Stone en Español Awards, demonstrating critical recognition across multiple prestigious institutions.
