## Biography
Tom Misch, born Thomas Abraham Misch on 25 June 1995 in East Dulwich, London, England, is a British singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and producer known for his genre-blending sound. He began playing guitar and singing at a young age, discovering influences like J Dilla through his sister's ex-boyfriend while studying for A-levels as a sixth-form student. He pursued formal training in music production and sound engineering at the Institute of Contemporary Music Performance and is an alumnus of Trinity Laban College, honing his skills as a bedroom producer uploading tracks to SoundCloud starting in 2012[4][1][2].

Misch rose to prominence in the 2010s with his unique fusion of indie soul, jazz guitar licks over J Dilla-style hip-hop beats, soul, funk, and electronic elements, often self-producing, recording, mixing, and mastering from his bedroom studio in South-East London. Key releases include Beat Tape 1 and Beat Tape 2 (featuring South London collaborators), the Reverie EP, and his debut album Geography in 2018, building a dedicated fanbase independently via his label Beyond The Groove. He transitioned from online beats to live performances, selling out venues like Somerset House, Village Underground, and festivals such as Glastonbury, Coachella, Montreux Jazz Festival, and Splendour in the Grass, showcasing his energetic stage presence with full bands and looping skills[1][2][3][5].

His mastery of track layering and self-production has established him as a sought-after artist in the indie soul scene, with extensive world tours across Europe, North America, and Australia, live albums like Live at The Jazz Cafe, and a signature laid-back yet inventive style that continues to evolve toward more live-electronic fusions in upcoming projects[1][2].
