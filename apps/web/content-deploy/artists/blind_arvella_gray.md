## Biography
Blind Arvella Gray, born James Dixon (also referred to as Walter Dixon in some accounts) on January 28, 1906, in Somerville, Texas, was an American blues, folk, and gospel singer and guitarist who became a legendary street performer in Chicago.[1][2][4][7] Raised in poverty, he lost his sight in the 1930s under unclear circumstances—possibly during a bank robbery in Peoria or another incident—and adopted the stage name Blind Arvella Gray to busk for a living.[8][9] Gray moved to Chicago, where he spent over half a century performing on the bustling streets, particularly at the Maxwell Street flea market and rapid-transit depots, captivating audiences with his stentorian yet lilting voice, rhythmic guitar playing in country blues style, and engaging storytelling.[1][3][5]

Active from the 1940s onward, Gray's career highlighted his resilience as a self-taught musician blending blues, folk, and gospel traditions without formal training or major label support.[2] In the 1960s, he recorded two singles on his own Gray label, including 'Freedom Rider' backed with 'Freedom Bus,' reflecting civil rights themes.[1] His sole album, *The Singing Drifter* (1973, Birch Records; reissued 2005 on Conjuroo), captured his raw, narrative-driven style and was produced with liner notes by Cary Baker.[1][9] Gray's performances emphasized vivid tales and traditional songs, establishing him as a fixture of Chicago's street music scene.[3][6]

Blind Arvella Gray passed away on September 7, 1980, in Chicago, Illinois, at age 74, and was buried at Restvale Cemetery.[1][2] His legacy endures as a symbol of overlooked blues authenticity, embodying the grit of urban busking and preserving acoustic country blues amid the city's electric blues evolution, though his low Spotify popularity (0) underscores his niche status.[1][3]
