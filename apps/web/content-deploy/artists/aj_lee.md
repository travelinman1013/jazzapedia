## Biography
AJ Lee, born and raised in Tracy, California, in the San Joaquin Valley, discovered her musical talent early, matching her mother’s singing pitch as a toddler in their Chevy Suburban and performing her first song, the gospel tune “Angel Band,” on ukulele at age 4 during an open mic at Mission Pizza & Pub in Fremont. Influenced by country artists like Bonnie Raitt, Merle Haggard, Buck Owens, and Rhonda Vincent playing in her home, she was introduced to bluegrass through Frank Solivan Sr.'s Kids on Bluegrass program at the Father’s Day Bluegrass Festival, emphasizing performance skills and collaboration. By age 7, she took up the mandolin and joined the family band The Tuttles, featuring bluegrass educator Jack Tuttle and his children Molly, Sullivan, and Michael, performing at venues like Strawberry Bluegrass Festival and Freight & Salvage in Berkeley.[1][2][4]

After high school in 2015, AJ Lee moved to Santa Cruz, forming Blue Summit with childhood festival friends, including guitarist Sullivan Tuttle, blending traditional bluegrass with contemporary elements like western swing, soul, folk, jazz, and pop. A powerful singer, mandolinist, and songwriter, she plays fiddle, guitar, ukulele, and banjo, earning six Northern California Bluegrass Society Female Vocalist awards and the 2019 IBMA Vocalist Momentum Award. The band released their debut full-length album in 2019, followed by “I’ll Come Back” in 2021 and “City of Glass” later, with albums produced by figures like Lech Wierzynski; they’ve toured extensively across the US and internationally.[1][3][6]

As an Asian American woman, AJ Lee brings diversity to bluegrass, leading a new generation of Californian players from the Sierra Nevada foothills to national stages, emphasizing perseverance, chemistry, and simple yet unique songwriting within the genre’s chord structures.[1][5][8]
