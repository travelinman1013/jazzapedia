## Biography
François Luambo Luanzo Makiadi, known as Franco, was born on July 6, 1938, in Sona-Bata, Bas-Zaire region, Belgian Congo (now Democratic Republic of Congo). After his father's death, he quit school and moved to Léopoldville (now Kinshasa) with his mother, Mama Makiese, playing a homemade guitar at her market stall to attract customers. Tutored by guitarist Paul Ebengo Dewayon from age seven or starting professionally at 12, Franco made his solo debut in 1953 with 'Bolingo na ngai na Beatrice,' sung in Lingala, marking his entry into Congolese rumba.[1][3][5][6]

In 1956, at age 18, Franco co-founded the sextet OK Jazz with Jean Serge Essous at the Little Okay Bar, later renaming it TPOK Jazz (Tout-Puissant Orchestre Kinois). After Essous left in 1958, Franco became bandleader, expanding it to over 50 members. His guitar style featured polyrhythmic sophistication and multi-string plucking, defining the 'OK Jazz School.' Over nearly 40 years, he released over 150 albums, composed nearly 1,000 songs, and toured Africa and Europe, with hits like 'Mario' (1985) and 'Attention na SIDA' (1987), addressing social issues including AIDS.[1][3][5][6][7]

Franco's music transcended language, class, and borders, dominating charts in Central, Eastern, and Western Africa. He died on October 12, 1989, at age 51, leaving a monumental legacy in African popular music through elaborate narrative songs in Congolese rumba and cha-cha-chá styles.[1][6][7]
