## Biography
Rhiannon Giddens, born in Greensboro, North Carolina, graduated from Oberlin Conservatory of Music with a degree in vocal performance, initially focusing on opera. After returning to her native Greensboro, she worked various jobs, including as a singing hostess at a Macaroni Grill, before shifting her interest to American roots and folk music, particularly its overlooked Black origins. She took up the banjo to reclaim it as an instrument born in Black culture and co-founded the Carolina Chocolate Drops, learning directly from fiddler Joe Thompson.[3][6][7]

Giddens's career expanded beyond folk into diverse projects, including composing the Pulitzer Prize-winning opera Omar with Michael Abels in 2023, earning a MacArthur 'genius' grant in 2017, and releasing albums like You're the One in 2023, which blends banjo with funk, zydeco, blues, and horns. Her musical style draws from old-time string band music, blues, and influences like Aretha Franklin, Dolly Parton, Patti Page, and Bonnie Raitt, while addressing historical narratives such as interracial love and slavery. She has collaborated on high-profile works, including Beyoncé's Cowboy Carter, and hosts projects exploring banjo history.[2][3][6]

Living in Ireland with partner Francesco Turrisi and her two children from her marriage to Irish musician Michael Laffan, Giddens continues to excavate American music's roots to inform the present, emphasizing Sankofa—fetching the past to move forward. Her legacy lies in bridging genres, reclaiming Black contributions to Americana, and inspiring global fights against cultural erasure through scholarship, performance, and composition.[3][6][9]
