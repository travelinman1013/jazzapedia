## Biography
Los Po-Boy-Citos is a New Orleans-based Latin Soul band that emerged in the 2000s as a premier ensemble dedicated to blending traditional New Orleans R&B with Latin music styles. The group embraced a fusion ethic from their inception, merging New Orleans R&B hits with boogaloo tunes on their 2008 debut album 'New Orleans Latin Soul,' which established their signature sound as a bridge between two distinct musical traditions. The band continued to develop their craft through subsequent releases, including their third and final album 'HASTA' (2013), which featured all original compositions and solidified their reputation as innovators in the New Orleans Latin Soul genre. Their work successfully evoked vintage Latin dance music while maintaining contemporary relevance, drawing comparisons to other retro-minded projects in their approach to historical musical styles.
