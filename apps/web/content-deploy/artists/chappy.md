## Biography
CHAPPY, an instinctual folk instrumentalist proficient on banjo, acoustic guitar, and dulcimer, was raised in Georgia and profoundly shaped by visits to his grandmother in the North Carolina mountains, where Willie Nelson’s Honky Tonk Radio played constantly amid lap harps and dusty organs. His other grandmother, a prolific painter, instilled influences of beauty, texture, and emotional depth, rooting sound and story deeply within him from an early age. He developed through theater and church music before moving to Nashville, TN, to study music further, spending over a decade writing, performing, arranging for others, and training as a bandleader while composing for podcasts, films, and narrative projects.[1][2]

Grounded in Nashville's rock & roll and Americana scenes, CHAPPY's music blends raw emotion and power with heavy guitars, haunting hooks, and a testifying voice, evoking open roads, dive bars, and visceral storytelling. His debut album *Wrestle Me*, years in the making, captures heartbreak, healing, and life's chaos, with tracks like “We’ll Be Alright” pulsing with conviction and doubt, and “My Father is a Good Man” reckoning with familial love amid brokenness. Influences span James Taylor, Brittany Howard, Bruce Springsteen, and Nathaniel Rateliff, crafting songs that feel like a fistfight and confession.[2]

Now over two decades into his musical journey, CHAPPY channels a life well-traveled into bruised-knuckle folk pop that demands to be felt, marked by grit, place, and worn-wood texture. His artistry emphasizes story and feel, transitioning from behind-the-scenes work to his own raw, honest solo output.[1][2]
