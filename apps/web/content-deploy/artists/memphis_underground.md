## Biography
Memphis Underground is a 1969 jazz fusion album by flutist Herbie Mann that represents a landmark collaboration between New York jazz musicians and Memphis's legendary studio musicians. Recorded at Chips Moman's American Sound Studio in Memphis, the album fuses jazz and rhythm and blues (R&B) genres, featuring Mann alongside principal soloists Roy Ayers, Larry Coryell, and Sonny Sharrock. The rhythm section consisted of the American Sound Studio house band—the Memphis Boys—who were renowned for their work on countless hit recordings. Produced and engineered by Tom Dowd, the album created a unique sound that blended the sophistication of New York jazz with the soulful depth of Memphis R&B, appealing to a broad audience and establishing Mann's direction toward world music and soul-influenced jazz.

The album's significance lies in its innovative fusion approach and the caliber of musicians involved. While the principal soloists were established jazz leaders, the session was grounded in the Memphis studio tradition that had produced hits for artists like Dusty Springfield, Neil Diamond, and Elvis Presley. The combination of young New York jazz innovators with one of the South's most storied rhythm sections proved transformative, creating music that transcended both Memphis soul and New York jazz conventions. Following this 1969 success, Memphis Underground became a catalyst for Mann's subsequent work in smooth jazz, funk, reggae, and disco-influenced recordings that, while criticized by jazz purists, kept Mann active during a period of declining mainstream interest in traditional jazz.
