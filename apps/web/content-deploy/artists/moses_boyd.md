## Biography
Moses Boyd, born on April 30, 1991, in Catford, South London, to parents of Dominican and Jamaican descent, began his musical journey as a teenager at Sedgehill School, where he received drum instruction from Bobby Worth. His early exposure to jazz came through the Tomorrow's Warriors program, and he later graduated with a Bachelor of Music in jazz drums from Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance in 2016. Starting drums at age 13, Boyd drew inspiration from diverse sources like Miles Davis's *Kind of Blue* and Dizzee Rascal's *Boy in Da Corner*, blending jazz with grime, electronica, afrobeats, soca, reggae, and drum and bass to create a genre-defying sound rooted in the African diaspora and London city life.[1][2][4]

Boyd rose to prominence in the mid-2010s as a key figure in the London jazz revival, forming the duo Binker & Moses with saxophonist Binker Golding in 2014, releasing acclaimed albums like *Dem Ones* (2015), which won a MOBO Award for Best Jazz Act, and *Feeding the Machine* (2022). He leads the band Moses Boyd Exodus (also known as The Exodus), featuring Theon Cross on tuba, Artie Zaitz on guitar, Binker Golding on saxophone, and Nathaniel Cross on trombone, with mixtapes and solo releases on his Exodus Records label. His debut solo album *Dark Matter* (2020) earned a Mercury Prize nomination, and he has collaborated widely with artists like Beyoncé, Little Simz, Sons of Kemet, Zara McFarlane, Four Tet, Floating Points, and Sampha.[1][2][3][4][5][7]

As a bandleader, composer, record producer, DJ, and BBC Radio 1Xtra resident, Boyd has pushed jazz into club culture, performing at venues like Fabric and Corsica Studios, and influencing new generations by making the genre accessible to diverse audiences. His work explores themes of the African diaspora and urban life, earning praise as a progenitor of the modern London jazz scene from outlets like *The Guardian*.[1][2][5]
