## Biography
Marco Benevento, born on July 22, 1977, in Livingston, New Jersey, began playing piano at age seven and developed an early interest in synthesizers and home recording during his teens. He attended Ramapo High School, graduating in 1995, and later Berklee College of Music, from which he graduated in 1999, immersing himself in jazz studies under mentors like Joanne Brackeen, Kenny Werner, John Medeski, and Brad Mehldau. After moving to New York City, he became a fixture in the experimental jazz and rock scene, starting with the Jazz Farmers (1999-2001) and forming the instrumental duo Benevento/Russo with drummer Joe Russo in 2001, known for its use of Hammond organ, Wurlitzer piano, circuit-bent toys, and loops.[1][2][3][5]

Benevento launched his solo career in 2006, releasing his debut album *Invisible Baby* in 2008, nominated for an Independent Music Award, followed by *Me Not Me* (2009), *Between the Needles and Nightfall* (2010), *Tigerface* (2012), and others under his Royal Potato Family label, which he co-founded in 2009. His style blends jazz roots with jam band, indie rock, and experimental elements, featuring amplified acoustic piano with effects pedals, synthesizers, and drum machines. He has performed at major venues and festivals like Carnegie Hall, Newport Jazz Festival, SXSW, Bonnaroo, and Lollapalooza, often with rotating trios including bassists Dave Dreiwitz (2012-2016), Karina Rykman (2016-present), and drummers Andrew Borger and others. Benevento also founded Fred Short studio in Upstate New York and has been part of Joe Russo's Almost Dead.[1][4][5][7]

His legacy endures through a devoted fanbase in jam band and experimental circles, with recent work like the 2020 self-titled album *Benevento* showcasing psych-funk grooves recorded in his home studio near the Catskills. Collaborations with Phish's Mike Gordon and Trey Anastasio in GRAB, Garage A Trois, and Bustle in Your Hedgerow highlight his genre-blurring influence, while his high-energy live shows and production role solidify his status in New York's underground scene.[2][4][6]

- He amplifies his acoustic piano using pickups and effects pedals like distortion and delay, incorporating circuit-bent toys, synthesizers, and drum machines into his experimental sound.[1][5]
