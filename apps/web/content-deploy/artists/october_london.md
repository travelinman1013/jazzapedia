## Biography
October London, born Jared Samuel Erskine on October 17, 1986, in South Bend, Indiana, grew up in a musically inclined family with a singer mother, guitar-playing father, and singer uncles who nurtured his early passion for music. He began playing piano in kindergarten without formal lessons, learning by recording himself on a boom box, and attended local schools including McKinley Elementary and John Adams High School. Initially aspiring to careers like storm chaser or truck driver, his innate musical talent emerged organically, leading him to release music under the name Sam London before adopting October London.

London's career gained momentum in 2016 when producer Jazze Pha introduced his track 'Color Blind' to Snoop Dogg, resulting in a deal with Cadillacc Music, which later transitioned to Death Row Records after its closure. His debut single 'Black Man in America' and EP Color Blind: Love marked his entry, followed by collaborations and appearances like on Snoop's albums and the TV series Empire. The 2023 single 'Back to Your Place' from the album The Rebirth of Marvin topped the Billboard Adult R&B Songs chart for nine weeks, blending retro soul, neo soul, and contemporary R&B with influences from Marvin Gaye, The Isley Brothers, Frankie Beverly and Maze, Sam Cooke, Teddy Pendergrass, and Luther Vandross.

London's legacy builds on preserving classic soul traditions while innovating for modern audiences, evidenced by soundtrack contributions like 'Eternity' for The Color Purple, nominations for Soul Train Music Awards, and tours such as the 2024 Rebirth of Marvin Tour with J. Brown and The Shindellas. His evocative vocals and versatile output position him as a bridge between R&B eras.
