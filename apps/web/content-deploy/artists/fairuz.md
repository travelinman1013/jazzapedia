## Biography
Fairuz, born Nouhad Wadie Haddad on November 20 or 21, 1935, in Beirut, Lebanon, grew up in a modest Christian family as the eldest of four children. Her vocal talent emerged early; as a teenager, she joined her school choir and was discovered by musician Muhammad Fleifel, who recruited her for the Lebanese radio station chorus around age 12. There, composer Halim El-Roumi recognized her unique flexibility in singing Arabic and Western modes, appointed her as a chorus singer, composed songs for her, and gave her the stage name Fairuz, meaning 'turquoise.' In the late 1940s, she met brothers Assi and Mansour Rahbani at the station, leading to her breakthrough with the 1952 song 'Itab' ('Blame'), recorded in Damascus, which propelled her to fame across the Arab world. She married Assi Rahbani in 1954 or 1955 and gave birth to their son Ziad in 1956.

Fairuz's career flourished in the 1950s and 1960s through collaborations with the Rahbani Brothers, who composed and wrote most of her material, blending Lebanese folk traditions with Western dance influences like tangos in innovative 'dance songs.' They created colorful folkloric musicals set in Lebanese locales such as Baalbek and cedar forests, with her debut major concert at the Baalbek International Festival in 1957. Her repertoire expanded to art songs, classical Arabic, dialect pieces, and patriotic themes celebrating Lebanon, Jerusalem, and Arab unity, earning her the title 'voice of Lebanon.' During Lebanon's civil war, she performed abroad but refused to sing domestically until reunification. Assi Rahbani's 1973 stroke shifted more composition to Mansour, yet she continued with comebacks like 1990s Beirut concerts and albums into the 2010s, including 'Ayh Fī Amal' (2010) and 'Bibālī' (2017), selling over 80 million records worldwide.

Fairuz's musical style, defined by her natural, versatile voice and Rahbani innovations, made her one of the 20th century's most celebrated Arab singers alongside Umm Kulthum. Her legacy endures as an icon of modern Arabic music, embodying hope, patriotism, and cultural unity, with a career spanning over six decades, nearly 1,500 songs, 80+ albums, and 20 musicals.
