## Biography
Ed Lincoln, born Eduardo Lincoln Barbosa de Sabóia on May 31, 1932, in Fortaleza, Ceará, Brazil, discovered his passion for music as a teenager after watching the film *Rhapsody in Blue*. He taught himself piano, learned popular songs like Ary Barroso's *Aquarela do Brasil*, and at age 16 formed a trio that performed on Radio Iracema while he worked as a sports editor for *Diário do Povo*. At 18, he moved to Rio de Janeiro to study architecture but shifted focus to music, performing daily on Radio Roquette Pinto, where he befriended key figures like Luizinho Eça, Johnny Alf, Tom Jobim, and Baden Powell, and developed a love for jazz, particularly Oscar Peterson.[1][3]

Lincoln quickly gained prominence as a bassist in early bossa nova sessions, recording with Trio Plaza, Maestro Radamés Gnattali Quintet, and Aloisio de Oliveira's first bossa nova production. He formed the Hotel Plaza Trio with Baden Powell on guitar and Luiz Marinho on bass after Eça left for Vienna. In 1958, a pivotal moment came when Hammond organist Djalma Ferreira was injured; Lincoln learned the organ in hours and mastered it, launching his solo career with albums like *Ao Teu Ouvido* (1958) and *This is Ed Lincoln* (1961), blending piano and organ through studio overdubs. His style spanned Brazilian jazz, bossa nova, samba, space age pop, and easy listening, with hits like *O Ganso* (with D'Orlann) and arrangements for *O Bêbado* (Durval Ferreira).[1][2][3]

In later years, Lincoln formed De Savoya Discos in 1968, releasing a self-titled album showcasing 12 diverse styles, and the DeSavoya Combo. He produced and arranged for artists like Elza Soares in the 1970s. A car accident in 1963 sidelined him for seven months, with Eumir Deodato filling in. Lincoln continued until his death on July 16, 2012, in Rio de Janeiro, leaving a legacy as a versatile pioneer bridging bossa nova and Brazilian jazz organ sounds.[1][3]

## Fun Facts
- Lincoln learned to play the Hammond organ in just four hours in 1958 after Djalma Ferreira was shot and couldn't perform; he had never touched the instrument before.[1][3]
- A car accident in 1963 kept him out for seven months, during which 20-year-old Eumir Deodato substituted for him at gigs.[1][3]
- His 1968 self-titled album on De Savoya Discos featured 12 songs in 12 completely different styles to demonstrate his versatility.[1]
- Originally named 'Eduardo Lincoln' for his debut album, the label owner changed it to 'Ed Lincoln' deeming the full name not commercial enough.[1]
