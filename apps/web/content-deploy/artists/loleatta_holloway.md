## Biography
Loleatta Holloway was born in Chicago, Illinois, where she began singing gospel at age five with the Holloway Community Singers, a traveling group of over 100 members founded and led by her mother. She studied drama in school and, at 17, joined the renowned gospel group The Caravans led by Albertina Walker, recording eight albums from 1967 to 1972 with hits like 'Carry Me Home' and 'Jesus Will Fix It.' During this time, she opened for artists like Aretha Franklin and Redd Foxx, and performed in the Chicago cast of the musical 'Don't Bother Me, I Can't Cope.' In 1971, during a break from The Caravans, she met songwriter/producer Floyd Smith, whom she later married, marking her transition to secular music with the regional hit 'Rainbow '71.'

Holloway's secular career gained momentum with Floyd Smith producing her debut albums on Atlanta's Aware Records, including the 1975 release 'Cry to Me,' which featured a Top 10 R&B single and drew comparisons to Diana Ross and Gladys Knight. Her breakthrough came in 1976 with producer Norman Harris at Salsoul's Gold Mind label, yielding disco classics like 'Hit and Run,' 'Dreamin’,' 'Love Sensation' (with Dan Hartman), and 'Queen of the Night.' Known for her powerful, emotive vocals in Philly soul, disco, and later house music, she scored nine disco hits between 1977 and 1979. A major resurgence occurred in the 1980s and 1990s via sampling, though she faced a bitter legal battle with Black Box over their unauthorized use of her vocals on 'Ride on Time.'

Holloway's legacy endures as one of the most-sampled voices in dance music, influencing Chicago house and post-disco with her intense, gospel-rooted delivery. She continued performing into the 2000s, releasing tracks like 'Strong Enough' with remixes by Larry Levan and Francois Kevorkian, and passed away on March 21, 2011, at age 64.
