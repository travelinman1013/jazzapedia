## Biography
Adolphus Anthony Cheatham, known as Doc Cheatham, was born on June 13, 1905, in Nashville, Tennessee, to parents of African American, Cherokee, and Choctaw descent. As a teenager, he took up the cornet and trumpet, studying under itinerant circus trumpeters Professor N. C. Davis and Professor C. M. Davis. He earned his nickname 'Doc' playing in a band at Meharry Medical College and in the pit orchestra at Nashville's Bijou Theatre, where he backed performers like Bessie Smith. Moving to Chicago in 1924, he was profoundly influenced by King Oliver, who gave him a treasured mute, and Louis Armstrong, shaping his smooth, soulful trumpet style blending classic New Orleans jazz, big band swing, and later Latin rhythms.[1][2][4][5]
