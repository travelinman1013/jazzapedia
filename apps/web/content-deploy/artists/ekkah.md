## Quick Info

## Biography
EKKAH is a British nu-disco and funk duo formed by multi-instrumentalists Rebekah Pennington and Rebecca Wilson, both from Birmingham, UK. The two best friends met at school at age 15 and previously played together in the angst-rock band The Arcadian Kicks before transitioning to a fresh, funk-inspired sound around 2013. Drawing from their shared love of artists like Fleetwood Mac, Jocelyn Brown, and Moloko, they blend soul, disco, funk, modern pop, and indie elements with upfront twists, aiming to bring good times to dance floors worldwide.[1][2][3][6]

Since forming, EKKAH has built a steady presence in the music scene, releasing tracks like their debut '7AM,' 'Figure It Out,' 'Last Chance to Dance,' 'Giving Up On,' 'Wendy's Yard,' and 'All Night.' They are as comfortable in the studio as on stage, having performed at major festivals including Glastonbury, Bestival, Boardmasters, Mighty Hoopla, and Secret Garden Party, as well as supporting Jess Glynne on tour and playing venues like London's Moth Club and The Shipping Forecast. Self-releasing early works like 'Homesick' in 2019 without management or a label highlights their independent hustle.[3][4][5][6]

Based in London, EKKAH's music features funky basslines, engaging melodies, bright soulful vocals often in harmony, and influences from 1980s and 1990s sounds with a contemporary edge. Their live disco sound positions them for global attention, with remixes and collaborations expanding their reach in the nu-disco genre.[1][2][5]
