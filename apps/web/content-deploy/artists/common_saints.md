## Biography
Common Saints is the musical alias of Charlie J Perry, a London-based artist born in London and raised in Oxfordshire, England. He began playing piano at age 6 with classical training, started writing songs at 13, and producing at 14, inspired by artists like Pink Floyd, Michael Jackson, Grover Washington Jr., Bee Gees, and Roy Ayers. Self-taught on guitar and drums through jamming, he previously fronted a band called Riot Park at age 17. Now based in South London, he produces psychedelic soul, retro soul, and R&B music in his home studios, blending hippie ideals of love and unity with flawless, heartfelt production featuring instruments like his 1961 Gibson 335 guitar and Bechstein piano.[1][3][4]

Perry's career gained traction with EPs like Idol Eyes (2020) and Starchild (2021), showcasing smooth, seductive soulful songs such as 'Idol Eyes,' 'Summer Sun,' 'Starchild,' and 'Lovesong.' His style draws from jazz, funk, and classic soul influences like Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder, creating groovy, emotive tracks that evoke emotion and nostalgia. During the pandemic, he remained prolific, collaborating remotely and recording a full album, while working on projects like an EP with Mychelle and his debut Common Saints album.[1][2][3]

Common Saints' music, described as nutritious sounds for the ears and movies for the mind, defines a 'Common Saint' as a Good Samaritan, emphasizing healing societal division through contemporary psychedelic soul. With no major label backing evident, his independent rise via Bandcamp and streaming platforms highlights his distinctive voice in modern R&B and soul.[2][3]
