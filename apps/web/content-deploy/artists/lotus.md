## Biography
Lotus is a five-piece instrumental jam band that formed in 1998 at Goshen College in Indiana, emerging from the jam and electronic music scenes of the late 1990s.[2][3] The band's founding members—Luke Miller, Mike Greenfield, Jesse Miller, and Steve Lubitz—first met at Rocky Mountain Mennonite Camp in Colorado in 1997, where they began jamming together during the summer.[3] After relocating to Goshen College in the fall of 1998, they recruited drummer Andy Parada and officially formed Lotus, initially performing covers of jam bands like Phish and the Grateful Dead alongside original compositions.[3] The band's early years were marked by a gradual shift in musical direction; by 1999-2000, influenced by electronic music and artists like the Orb, they began experimenting with trance beats and electronic elements, developing what Luke Miller termed "Organic-Ambient-Trance-Funk."[3] In 2001, the band made a pivotal decision to turn fully instrumental, adding percussionist Chuck Morris to their lineup.[3] Over two decades, Lotus evolved from playing small basement clubs and local venues to becoming festival favorites at major events including Bonnaroo, Camp Bisco, Outside Lands, Ultra Music Festival, and Electric Forest, while also performing at prestigious venues like Red Rocks.[2] The band's sound expanded to incorporate influences from electronic dance music, indie-rock, classic rock, instrumental hip-hop, and disco, with their high-energy, dance-inducing performances and tight improvisational compositions earning them a hyper-loyal following.[2][4] In 2021, the band welcomed guitarist Tim Palmieri, known for his virtuosic playing and melodic improvisation, bringing fresh energy to the group.[2]

## Fun Facts
- The band's formation was partly inspired by fate: when Mike and Luke arrived at Goshen College in fall 1998, they spotted a mini-van with a Phish sticker during move-in day and discovered it belonged to Andy Parada, a drummer who would become their founding drummer.[3]
- Early band practices were so intense and hot that the members nicknamed them "sweat-fests," and the band's musical direction was significantly influenced by Steve Lubitz attending a rave outside Boulder in 1999, after which he suggested the band incorporate electronic dance music elements into their sound.[3]
- The band's debut studio album, Nomad (2006), became a touchstone for how to organically fuse elements of electronica with jam music, establishing their signature sound that would influence the jamtronica genre.[2]
- In 2020, Lotus recorded 18 tracks in just three days at Spice House Sound in Philadelphia while simultaneously shooting video footage, maintaining their live band chemistry and real-time interaction during the recording process.[4]
