## Biography
Mama Digdown’s Brass Band is a New Orleans–style brass band founded in Madison, Wisconsin, far upriver from the music’s Crescent City birthplace but deeply rooted in its second line parade tradition.[1][5] Emerging amid the New Orleans brass band revival of the 1980s and early 1990s, they came up in the same era that saw Rebirth Brass Band, the Soul Rebels, and the Hot 8 Brass Band shaping a modern, hard‑grooving brass sound.[1][3][4][5] From the outset, the group focused on capturing the street‑parade feel of classic New Orleans ensembles while channeling it through the lens of Midwestern musicians who studied the style, traveled to Louisiana, and embraced the city’s social‑club and parade culture.[1][2]

Over more than three decades, Mama Digdown’s has toured extensively, acting as tireless ambassadors for New Orleans brass band music at clubs, major festivals, and concert halls around the world.[1][2] Their repertoire combines traditional second line standards, classic New Orleans R&B, and funk with original tunes that keep the idiom evolving while remaining anchored in collective improvisation, call‑and‑response horn lines, and a powerful street beat.[1][2][5] With nine albums released, they have built a reputation as one of the most energetic and stylistically faithful brass bands outside New Orleans, culminating in invitations to perform at Congo Square for the New Orleans Brass Fest in both 2018 and 2019—an honor that situates the Madison group within the core contemporary brass band community of New Orleans itself.[1]

Musically, Mama Digdown’s is known for its driving sousaphone bass lines, interlocking trumpet and trombone riffs, and percussion patterns modeled on second line parade rhythms, all delivered with a raw, dance‑oriented energy that translates from parades to clubs and festival stages.[1][2][5] While firmly rooted in tradition, the band’s arrangements and grooves often lean into modern funk and R&B inflections, reflecting the broader trajectory of the brass band revival that blurred lines between traditional jazz, street music, and contemporary Black popular music.[1][3][4][5] Their long career and consistent focus on New Orleans idioms have made them a reference point for Midwestern musicians interested in brass band performance and a key part of the ongoing, geographically wider story of New Orleans brass music.

- Mama Digdown’s has released nine albums—an unusually large discography for a non‑New‑Orleans brass band—cementing their role as one of the most prolific second line ensembles based outside Louisiana.[1]
- They were invited to perform at Congo Square for the New Orleans Brass Fest in both 2018 and 2019, a rare honor for an out‑of‑town band and a strong mark of acceptance by the core New Orleans brass community.[1]
