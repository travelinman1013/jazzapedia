## Biography
Nikki Hill is a North Carolina-born soul-rock singer and bandleader who has earned the moniker "Southern Fireball" for her high-energy performances and distinctive vocal style.[1] Raised by a single mother and two older sisters in Durham, North Carolina, Hill's musical foundation began in church gospel choirs during her childhood and early teenage years.[1][2] Her early exposure to R&B, soul, pop, and hip-hop at home, combined with her later discovery of garage rock, rock and roll, blues, and roots music, created a unique sonic palette that would define her artistry.[2] Hill's curiosity led her to transition from church performances to live music venues, where she discovered a direct connection between the energy of local shows and the spiritual intensity of gospel services.[1]

Hill's career gained momentum through relentless touring and word-of-mouth promotion, initially self-releasing her debut album "Here's Nikki Hill" before securing wider recognition.[1][2] Her song "Struttin'" appeared on Deke Dickerson and The Bo-Keys' "Soul Meets Country" EP, produced by Scott Bomar in Memphis, Tennessee.[1][2] Her second album, "Heavy Hearts Hard Fists," recorded at Fort Horton Studios in Wyldwood, Texas, marked a significant milestone, accompanied by a worldwide tour spanning the US, Europe, Australia, India, and Morocco, with performances at over 30 festivals including Montreux Jazz Festival, Monterey Jazz Festival, and Byron Bay Blues Festival.[1][2] Rolling Stone praised her as "a vocal powerhouse" and "a revelation," comparing her to "Tina Turner fronting AC/DC."[1][2]

Hill's artistic identity reflects her intentional blending of multiple musical traditions—combining the soulful, sensual, and bold vocal tones of R&B, soul, and gospel with the raw energy of blues, garage rock, and roots music.[1] Her performances are characterized by powerful guitar-driven arrangements, frank self-reflection in songwriting, and an electrifying stage presence that has made her a fixture on the international roots-rock circuit.[1][4] Currently based in Memphis, Tennessee, Hill continues to tour with her band featuring her husband Matt Hill on guitar, alongside Laura Chavez (guitar), Nick Gaitan (bass), and Marty Dodson (drums).[1]
