## Biography
Bobby Rush, born November 10, 1933, in Homer, Louisiana, and Kenny Wayne Shepherd, born June 12, 1977, in Shreveport, Louisiana, are two blues icons from northern Louisiana who began their careers young and share deep roots in the genre. Rush started performing at age 15, painting on a mustache to enter venues and hanging with older musicians, while Shepherd debuted at 13, forming his band by 15 and lobbying to change Louisiana child labor laws for underage club performances. Both influenced by early blues greats, Rush has released over 30 solo albums since the late 1970s, earning 16 Blues Music Awards from 56 nominations, three Grammy wins for Best Traditional Blues Album ('Porcupine Meat,' 'Rawer than Raw,' 'All My Love For You'), and inductions into the Blues Hall of Fame, Mississippi Musicians Hall of Fame, and Rhythm & Blues Hall of Fame[1][2][3][5]. Shepherd, a five-time Grammy nominee, has 17 albums, eight Top 10 Billboard Mainstream Rock singles, two Billboard Music Awards, two Orville H. Gibson Awards, and shares the record with B.B. King and Eric Clapton for longest-running Billboard Blues albums with 'Trouble Is…'[1][2][3].

Their musical styles blend traditional blues for Rush—featuring soulful vocals, rhythm guitar, and harmonica—with Shepherd's electrifying blues-rock guitar, vocals, and songwriting, creating a spontaneous, authentic sound. They connected at a festival like the Backroads Blues Festival, jamming onstage and deciding then to collaborate, leading to their 2024 album 'Young Fashioned Ways,' recorded live at Royal Studios in Memphis without pre-planned songs. Rush brought lyrics from a satchel, Shepherd crafted riffs and melodies, starting acoustically before full band sessions, capturing raw chemistry between generations[1][2][3][4].

Their legacy bridges blues traditions with modern rock, inspiring through awards, longevity, and this partnership that feels like 'friends playing unaware of creating greatness,' as Shepherd likened to Muddy Waters' 'Hard Again.' At 91 and 47, they exemplify blues endurance, with Rush's memoirs 'I Ain’t Studdin’ You' (2021) and film appearance in 'Dolemite Is My Name,' alongside Shepherd's work with The Rides (Stephen Stills, Barry Goldberg)[1][2][3].

## Fun Facts
- Shepherd attended his first concert—Muddy Waters and John Lee Hooker—at age 3, thanks to his father's music promoter job, and met Stevie Ray Vaughan as a child[2].
- Rush, at 15, painted a mustache to sneak into venues, while Shepherd's band at 15 got Louisiana law changed to allow under-18 club performances[2].
- For 'Young Fashioned Ways,' they entered Royal Studios with no pre-selected songs; Rush had a satchel of lyrics enough for '10 albums,' and they improvised everything spontaneously[1][2][3].
- Despite a 44- (or 44-year) age gap, they bonded instantly at a festival, both suggesting a joint album simultaneously backstage[1][2].
