## Biography
REBOLU (formerly Grupo Rebolú) is a Queens, New York-based Latin-fusion band specializing in Afro-Colombian rhythms from Colombia's Caribbean coast, including gaita and bullerengue. Founded in 2004 by childhood friends Ronald Polo (composer) and Morris Cañate (percussionist) from Barranquilla, Colombia, the group formed after the two trained at Barranquilla’s Escuela de Música and performed internationally with folkloric ensembles like La Corporación Cultural Barranquilla since age five. They moved to New York City to share their music, where singer Johanna Castañeda, originally from Bogotá with roots in joropo, joined after being drawn to their sound; she later married Polo and became band manager.[2][3][5]

The band's career developed through persistent performances in New York's Colombian community and beyond, blending traditional Colombian folk elements—such as interlocking African-derived drum rhythms, gaita flutes, and bullerengue—with modern touches like electric bass, saxophone, jazz, and reggae influences. Their distinctive eight-person lineup incorporates members from Colombia, Argentina, Mexico, and the US, creating layered textures rooted in authenticity. Key releases include the 2025 Smithsonian Folkways album *Mi Herencia (My Heritage)*, which reflects their heritage and family life, featuring contributions from Polo and Castañeda's young daughters.[2][4]

REBOLU's energetic live shows, highlighted by appearances like NPR's Tiny Desk, have built a reputation as a vibrant party embodying Colombia's African, Spanish, and Indigenous musical heritage. Despite pandemic challenges, they continue touring, preserving and evolving coastal traditions for global audiences while dedicating their work to passing culture to future generations.[2][4][7]
