## Biography
Jodeci, formed in 1989-1990 in Charlotte, North Carolina, by two pairs of brothers—Donald 'DeVante Swing' DeGrate and Dalvin DeGrate, and Cedric 'K-Ci' Hailey and Joel 'Jo-Jo' Hailey—emerged from gospel roots in their strictly religious homes. All members sang in church choirs and family gospel groups like Reverend DeGrate and the DeGrate Delegation and Little Cedric and the Hailey Singers during their youth. They met in their late teens after a near-fight over a shared romantic interest, bonding over shared musical ambitions to create R&B music, naming the group by combining parts of their nicknames: 'Jo' from JoJo, 'De' from DeGrate, and 'Ci' from K-Ci.[1][2][3]

Relocating to New York with a demo of 29 songs, they nearly faced rejection at Uptown Records until rapper Heavy D intervened, convincing president Andre Harrell to sign them. Their 1991 debut album *Forever My Lady* exploded with hits like 'Come and Talk to Me' and the title track, both reaching #1 on R&B charts, selling over three million copies and blending new jack swing, hip-hop soul, quiet storm, gospel, and R&B. Follow-ups *Diary of a Mad Band* (1993) and *The Show, the After Party, the Hotel* (1995) also hit #1 on R&B album charts, going platinum or multi-platinum despite label tensions, including flirtations with Death Row Records that led to minimal promotion. Known as the 'Bad Boys of R&B' for their rebellious image contrasting smooth ballads, they redefined the genre with edgy themes and production.[1][2][3][4]

By 1996, members pursued solo paths—DeVante as a producer, K-Ci & JoJo as a duo—without formally dissolving, though drugs and alcohol later challenged K-Ci & JoJo. Their legacy endures as trendsetters influencing 1990s R&B with innovative styles, earning platinum certifications and a lasting 'bad boy' persona amid gospel-trained vocals.[1][2][3][5]
