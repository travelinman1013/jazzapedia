## Biography
Andre Williams & the New Orleans Hellhounds represents a collaboration between legendary R&B and soul musician Andre Williams and a New Orleans-based band also known as the Morning 40 Federation. Andre Williams was born Zephire Andre Williams on November 1, 1936, in Bessemer, Alabama, and became a pioneering figure in R&B and early soul music. He began his professional career in Detroit during the 1950s with Fortune Records, where he performed with vocal groups including the Five Dollars and the Don Juans, recording twelve singles between 1955 and 1961. Williams became known for his sexually suggestive lyrics, flamboyant stage presence, and incorporation of spoken passages that presaged rap music, earning the nickname "Mr. Rhythm" from comedian Redd Foxx. His career spanned multiple decades and record labels, including work with Motown Records, One-derful Records in Chicago, and Chess Records, during which he produced hits for other artists and managed soul singer Edwin Starr.

After decades of struggle including a cocaine-fueled period of homelessness in Chicago during the 1980s, Williams experienced a remarkable comeback in the 1990s. In 1999, he began his relationship with Bloodshot Records, recording a country album titled Red Dirt with the Sadies. In 2007, Williams completed recording an album with the New Orleans-based band Morning 40 Federation, which was released in 2008 as Can You Deal With It by Bloodshot Records and credited to Andre Williams & the New Orleans Hellhounds. The album featured a ten-piece ensemble delivering a rollicking sound over nine tracks spanning 33 minutes. This late-career collaboration represented Williams' continued artistic vitality and his ability to adapt to contemporary musical contexts while maintaining his distinctive style.
