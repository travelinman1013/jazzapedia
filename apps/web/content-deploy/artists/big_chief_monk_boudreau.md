## Biography
Joseph Pierre “Big Chief Monk” Boudreaux is a seminal New Orleans singer, bandleader, and Mardi Gras Indian chief whose life bridges Black masking Indian traditions, R&B, funk, and roots music. Born in New Orleans, Louisiana, on December 7, 1941, he grew up in a family already deeply involved in the Mardi Gras Indian culture, with his father Raymond belonging to the Wild Squatoulas tribe.[1][6] Drawn into the traditions as a teenager, he began “masking” at about 16 with the White Eagles tribe before an internal dispute led him to join the Golden Eagles, where he eventually rose from Spy Boy to Big Chief.[1] Boudreaux’s ancestry includes a Cherokee grandfather and Haitian grandmother, and he has long described his role as chief as a spiritual discipline and a responsibility to guard esoteric customs and beliefs passed down through generations of the New Orleans Black community.[4]

In the 1960s and 1970s Boudreaux became one of the key figures bringing Mardi Gras Indian music from neighborhood streets to national and international stages. He was a founder and early musical leader of the Wild Magnolias band, recording two albums for Capitol Records and touring widely across the United States and Europe, including performances and television appearances with Robbie Robertson and a 1982 spot on Saturday Night Live.[1][3] During this period, he and other Indians worked with New Orleans students and folklorists to blend traditional Indian chants and percussion with contemporary R&B and funk, helping create the modern Mardi Gras Indian sound.[1] After leaving the Wild Magnolias in 2001, he collaborated with guitarist Anders Osborne on projects such as “Bury the Hatchet,” then returned to record with his home tribe the Golden Eagles, including the album “Mr. Jerome.”[3]

Boudreaux’s musical style centers on powerful call‑and‑response chants, tambourine‑driven grooves, and improvisational lyricism, often drawing on Native American, African, Caribbean, and blues influences while remaining rooted in New Orleans street culture.[1][4][8] His later work, such as the album “Bloodstains & Teardrops,” explicitly ties together New Orleans and Caribbean traditions, highlighting his Haitian heritage and the broader Afro‑Atlantic currents in Mardi Gras Indian music.[8] Over a career spanning more than half a century, he has performed at venues such as Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center and toured in the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Japan, becoming an international ambassador for the Mardi Gras Indian tradition.[1] At home in New Orleans, he leads Big Chief Monk Boudreaux & the Golden Eagles, now heavily involving his children and grandchildren to ensure the continuity of the tribe and its songs.[1][4][5] Recognized as the oldest living Mardi Gras Indian Big Chief and “Elder of Elders,” he has received a National Heritage Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts and is celebrated in murals, documentaries, and scripted dramas such as HBO’s Treme, cementing his legacy as both culture bearer and creative innovator.[1][4][5][8]
