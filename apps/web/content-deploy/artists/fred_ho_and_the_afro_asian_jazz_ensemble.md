## Biography
Fred Ho (born Fred Houn, August 10, 1957, in Palo Alto, California – April 12, 2014) was a pioneering American baritone saxophonist, composer, bandleader, playwright, writer, and Marxist social activist of Chinese descent. Moving to Massachusetts at age six, he immersed himself in music and activism during his youth, studying at Harvard where he co-founded the East Coast Asian Students Union. Changing his surname to Ho in 1988, he rejected labels like 'Asian-American jazz,' instead pioneering a revolutionary multicultural synthesis blending African American jazz traditions with Asian and Pacific folk elements, drawing from influences like Charles Mingus, Duke Ellington, John Coltrane, and Cal Massey.

Ho founded the Afro Asian Music Ensemble in 1982 and the Monkey Orchestra in 1980, leading them to critical acclaim with albums such as *Tomorrow Is Now!* (1986), *We Refuse to be Used and Abused* (1986), and *The Underground Railroad To My Heart* (1994), which fused free jazz with Chinese opera and other traditions, earning Village Voice Critics' Choice honors. A fervent activist, he co-established organizations like the Asian American Resource Workshop, AsianImprov Records, and the Asian American Arts Alliance, using his music and writings to champion anti-imperialism, revolutionary internationalism, and Asian American empowerment. Living in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, Ho lectured widely and published on music, politics, and culture until his death from cancer at age 56.

His legacy endures through the continued performances of the Afro Asian Music Ensemble, embodying his vision of transformative, multicultural music rooted in struggle and dignity.
