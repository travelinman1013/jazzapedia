## Biography
Clark Terry (1920-2015) was born in St. Louis, Missouri, where he began playing trumpet as a youth, blending the local St. Louis tone with emerging jazz styles. Urged by a professional musician to take the instrument seriously, he played odd jobs including a traveling carnival before turning professional in the early 1940s with bands like Ida Cox’s Darktown Scandals. He served in the U.S. Navy band during World War II (1942-1945), then rose rapidly with George Hudson, Charlie Barnet, Charlie Ventura, Eddie Vinson, and Count Basie (1948-1951), influencing Miles Davis and Quincy Jones early on. In 1951, Duke Ellington recruited him for his orchestra, where Terry stayed until 1959 as a featured soloist, excelling in swing to hard bop.[1][3][4][5]

Terry's career peaked with groundbreaking achievements: in 1960, he became NBC's first African-American staff musician for 12 years, appearing on The Tonight Show and scoring a hit with his scat vocal 'Mumbles' from the 1964 album Oscar Peterson Trio + One. He co-led a quintet with Bob Brookmeyer in the early 1960s, recorded over 900 sessions blending trumpet and flugelhorn with humor and technical mastery (including circular breathing), and later formed his Big B-A-D Band (1970s onward). His style spanned bebop, cool jazz, hard bop, and big band, marked by wide range, rapid articulation, and playful scatting.[1][2][4][6]

A dedicated educator, Terry organized jazz camps, launched Jazz Mobile and Harlem Youth Band, hosted the Clark Terry Jazz Festival from 2000, and mentored generations. He earned doctorates from Berklee and University of New Hampshire, a 2010 Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, and performed for eight U.S. Presidents across seven continents until diabetes ended his playing in later years. Terry died February 21, 2015, leaving a legacy as one of jazz's most recorded (902 sessions) and influential figures.[1][3][4][5]
