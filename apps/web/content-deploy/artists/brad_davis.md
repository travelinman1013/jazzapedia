## Biography
Brad Davis, a versatile guitarist, singer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist, began his musical journey in Fort Worth, Texas, where he started classical guitar lessons at age five. Soon after, inspired by his brother Greg's banjo playing, he switched to steel-string guitar to pursue bluegrass, studying masters like Flatt and Scruggs, Doc Watson, Norman Blake, Clarence White, Tony Rice, and later acoustic jazz influences in 1973. In 1978, he and Greg formed the bluegrass band Ten Degrees, hitting the festival circuit and performing as a Flatt and Scruggs duo at the Grapevine Opry, while building a session career in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.[1][2]

Davis's professional breakthrough came in 1986 when he moved to Nashville, initially missing a gig with Ricky Skaggs but landing a role at Opryland as a fiddle and guitar minstrel. He then served as lead guitarist for the Forester Sisters (five years), Marty Stuart (11 years), Sweethearts of the Rodeo (two years), Earl Scruggs (six years), and Sam Bush (three years), alongside stints with Billy Bob Thornton and the Boxmasters. His style blends bluegrass, newgrass, folk, rock, pop country, and soulful spiritual elements, highlighted by his patented 'Double-Down-Up' guitar technique, signature Alvarez guitar, and instructional work with Mel Bay Productions and Flatpicking Guitar Magazine.[1][2][3][4]

A Grammy-nominated recording artist signed to Louisiana Hayride Records, Davis has co-written chart-topping bluegrass songs like '4th and Goal' with Terry Baucom and 'Derailed' with Doyle Lawson, contributed to film scores for Willie Nelson and Billy Bob Thornton, and released solo projects including bluegrass tributes and gospel albums. He continues touring, recording, and producing from Texas, with recent CMH Records albums transforming country hits into bluegrass.[1][3][4]
