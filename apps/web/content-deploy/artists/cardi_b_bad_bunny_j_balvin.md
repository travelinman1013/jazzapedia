## Biography
Belcalis Marlenis Almánzar, known as Cardi B, was born on October 11, 1992, in Washington Heights, Manhattan, New York City, to a Trinidadian mother and Dominican father. Raised primarily in the Highbridge neighborhood of the South Bronx, she grew up in a large extended family speaking Spanish as her first language and faced challenges including poverty, gang involvement with the Bloods, and an abusive relationship. From a young age, she showed interest in performing, attending Renaissance High School for Musical Theater and Technology, where she participated in musicals and talent shows. After graduating in 2010, she worked low-paying jobs like at a deli, briefly attended Borough of Manhattan Community College, and at 19 became a stripper to escape hardship, crediting it with helping her return to school and gain financial independence.[1][2][3][5]

Cardi B rose to fame through social media on Vine and Instagram, then as a breakout star on VH1's Love & Hip Hop: New York in 2015-2016, where her sharp one-liners and personality shone. She left the show to pursue music full-time, debuting with the hit 'Bodak Yellow' in 2017, which propelled her to stardom. Her 2018 debut album Invasion of Privacy topped charts, featuring the number-one single 'I Like It'—making her the first female rapper with multiple Hot 100 toppers—and won the Grammy for Best Rap Album in 2019, the first for a solo female rapper. Her style blends hip-hop, trap, and Latin influences with unapologetic, empowering lyrics, resonating especially with young women, and aligns with genres like reggaeton and urbano latino per Spotify data.[1][2][3]

Cardi B's legacy includes breaking barriers in rap as a female artist of Afro-Caribbean descent, earning multiple awards like eight Billboard Music Awards and five American Music Awards. She expanded into acting with her film debut in Hustlers (2019) and remains a cultural force with her spirited persona, though her career has involved public personal life scrutiny.[1][2][5]
