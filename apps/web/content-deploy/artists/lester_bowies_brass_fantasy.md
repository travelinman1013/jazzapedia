## Biography
Lester Bowie's Brass Fantasy was formed in 1984 by trumpeter Lester Bowie, a pioneering figure in avant-garde jazz, as a brass nonet consisting of eight horns (four trumpets, two trombones, French horn, and tuba) and one drummer. Inspired by marching bands from Historically Black Colleges and Universities and army fife and bugle corps, the group blended free jazz, experimental jazz, and brass band styles with covers of popular music, reflecting Bowie's credo of 'great Black music from the ancient to the future.' The band debuted on ECM Records with the 1985 album *I Only Have Eyes for You*, featuring exuberant renditions of hits like Whitney Houston's 'Saving All My Love' and Willie Nelson's 'Crazy,' marking an unexpected pop venture for the label known for avant-garde jazz.[1][2]

Bowie's extensive background shaped Brass Fantasy's unique sound. Born in 1941 in Frederick, Maryland, and raised in St. Louis, Missouri, he began trumpet studies at age five under his father, a professional musician, and played with blues artists like Little Milton and Albert King, and R&B stars including Solomon Burke, Joe Tex, and Rufus Thomas. After co-founding the Black Artists Group (BAG) in St. Louis and moving to Chicago in 1966, he joined the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (AACM) and co-founded the Art Ensemble of Chicago in 1968, where he honed his jazz trumpet style marked by smears, blats, and growls. Brass Fantasy, realized after an invitation to a 1982 classical festival in Karlsruhe, Germany, continued this eclecticism, covering songs by James Brown, Bobby McFerrin, TLC, and Marilyn Manson across albums like *Avant Pop* (1986) and beyond.[1][2][3]

The group's legacy endures through its innovative fusion of genres, high-caliber musicianship, and Bowie's contrarian approach, which cultivated surprise, humor, and genre exploration. After leaving ECM, Brass Fantasy maintained its rambunctious repertoire, influencing contemporary trumpeters and brass ensembles. Bowie passed away in 1999, but the band's output, including *When the Spirit Returns* (1997), remains a testament to bridging jazz with popular music.[1][3][4]
