## Biography
Big Chief Juan Pardo, leader of the Golden Comanche Mardi Gras Indian tribe, was born into New Orleans' Black Masking Indian tradition, growing up immersed in family practices of sewing, dancing, singing, and masking. He followed his older brother Wallace Pardo, who served as Spy Boy in the Golden Arrows tribe under Big Chief Eugene “Pepe” Esteban. In 2004, after Esteban stepped down, Wallace founded the Golden Comanche tribe—a branch of Golden Arrows, incorporating 'Comanche' from family Hispanic heritage tied to his grandfather's travels through Mexico, Panama, Cuba, Texas, and encounters with Comanches—and Juan began masking as Spy Boy.[1][2][4]

Pardo advanced quickly through the ranks, becoming War Chief in 2009, First Chief, and Big Chief in 2015 when both Wallace and the Second Chief retired, bypassing the typical progression. As Big Chief, he leads with a focus on economic growth, mental health, and modern challenges for the tribe, while designing elaborate suits as spiritual creations and performing rituals like singing 'Indian Red' on Mardi Gras. His musical career blends tribal rhythms, chants, and percussion with New Orleans funk, performing and recording with bands like Tribal Gold, Galactic, the New Orleans Suspects, and 101 Runners. Pardo has also composed orchestral works 'Birth of a Culture' with Maxim Samarov at Tulane University, incorporating dance and ballet.[1][4][7][8]

Beyond masking, Pardo is a published author of the children's book *When the Morning Comes: A Mardi Gras Indian Story*, an actor in HBO's *Treme* and the film *Seeking Justice* with Nicolas Cage, and a culture consultant who has traveled worldwide. He collaborates with organizations like The Ella Project for legal protection of cultural assets and recently formalized a visual arts partnership with Lillian Aguinaga for the 2025 Golden Comanche poster.[1][2]

## Fun Facts
- The 'Golden Comanche' name derives from 'Golden' of the parent Golden Arrows tribe and 'Comanche' honoring his grandfather's Hispanic journeys through Mexico, Panama, Cuba, and Texas encounters with Comanches.[1][4]
- Pardo skipped the traditional Second Chief rank to become Big Chief in 2015 due to simultaneous retirements of his brother and the Second Chief.[1]
- He wears a 'dicki' or collar inspired by historical Comanche breastplates made of animal bones for battle protection, adapted into modern suit designs.[4]
- Pardo views The Ella Project as his 'weapon of choice' for legal protection, including establishing a 501(c)(3) for the tribe and negotiating sponsorships.[1]
