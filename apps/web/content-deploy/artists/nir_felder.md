## Biography
Nir Felder, born December 30, 1982, in New York City, grew up in the suburbs just outside the city, where he spent his youth playing in rock bands while discovering jazz through local record stores, drawing inspiration from icons like John Coltrane and Jimi Hendrix. He attended John Jay High School from 1997 to 2001 and then Berklee College of Music from 2001 to 2005 on a full scholarship, receiving prestigious awards including the Billboard Endowed Scholarship, Jimi Hendrix Award, and Stephen D. Holland Award. After graduating, Felder moved to New York City in 2006, rapidly establishing himself as a highly sought-after session guitarist and sideman, collaborating with luminaries across jazz, pop, R&B, and rock.[1][2][3]

Felder's career as a leader began in 2010 when he formed his own quartet, releasing his critically acclaimed debut album *Golden Age* in 2014 on Sony/OKeh, praised by The New York Times as 'lyrical and lofty' and by All About Jazz as 'mindboggling.' His subsequent albums include *II* in 2020 on Ropeadope Records and *III* in 2024 on La Reserve, showcasing his innovative blend of jazz improvisation with elements from rock, pop, R&B, and fusion, often using advanced sound design in the studio. His style fuses Afro-Cuban jazz and jazz fusion influences, earning him accolades like NPR's 'next big jazz guitarist' in 2010, a Grammy for Best Jazz Instrumental Album on Terri Lyne Carrington's *Money Jungle: Provocative in Blue* in 2013, and DownBeat Critics Poll wins for Rising Star Guitarist in 2021 and 2023.[1][2][3]

Beyond performing and recording—with tours across six continents at venues like Radio City Music Hall and Village Vanguard, and TV appearances on shows like *The Late Show with Stephen Colbert*—Felder has built a legacy as an educator, teaching at Fondazione Siena Jazz since 2012 and masterclasses worldwide at institutions including USC, University of North Texas, and CENART in Mexico City. As a faculty member at Berklee, he continues to shape the next generation while maintaining an active solo career.[2][3]
