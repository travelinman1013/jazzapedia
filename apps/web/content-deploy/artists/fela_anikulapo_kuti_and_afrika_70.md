## Biography
Fela Anikulapo Kuti, born on October 15, 1938, in Abeokuta, Colonial Nigeria, into the prominent Ransome-Kuti family, grew up in an upper-middle-class environment where his mother, Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti, was a renowned anti-colonial feminist and activist, and his father, Israel Oludotun Ransome-Kuti, was an Anglican minister and educator. Initially planning to study medicine, Kuti instead pursued music, studying classical music, piano, and percussion at Trinity College of Music in London starting in 1959, where he formed his first band, Koola Lobitos, blending highlife and jazz. Upon returning to Nigeria in the mid-1960s, he continued with the band but achieved a breakthrough during a 1969 U.S. tour, where exposure to Black Power activism and influences like James Brown inspired him to develop Afrobeat—a fusion of Yoruba rhythms, jazz, funk, highlife, and politically charged lyrics critiquing corruption and colonialism.[1][2][3]
