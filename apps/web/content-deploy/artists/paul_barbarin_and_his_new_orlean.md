## Biography
Adolphe Paul Barbarin, known as Paul 'T-Boy' Barbarin, was born on May 5, 1899, in New Orleans, Louisiana, into a prominent musical family led by his father Isidore Barbarin, a cornetist who shaped early brass bands, and including brothers like Louis and nephew Danny Barker. Self-taught on drums after briefly studying clarinet with godfather Paul Chaligny, he began playing in the mid-1910s with local bands such as the Silver Leaf Orchestra, Buddy Petit, Jimmie Noone, Chris Kelly, Sidney Bechet, Emanuel Perez, and the Onward Brass Band, embodying the rhythmic pulse of New Orleans jazz.[1][2][3]
