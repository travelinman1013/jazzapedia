## Biography
Andrew Bird, born July 11, 1973, in Chicago, Illinois, began playing violin at age four using the Suzuki method and grew up in the suburb of Lake Forest. He earned a violin performance degree from Northwestern University in 1996 but rejected classical rigidity, busking at weddings and Renaissance fairs while exploring vintage jazz. His career launched with the 1996 solo debut Music of Hair, blending folk, jazz, and blues, followed by contributions to Squirrel Nut Zippers' albums in the late 1990s.[1][2][3][5]

From 1997 to 2001, Bird led Andrew Bird's Bowl of Fire, releasing Thrills (1997), Oh! The Grandeur (1998), and The Swimming Hour (2001), fusing swing, gypsy jazz, folk, calypso, and pop elements with Chicago musicians like Kevin O'Donnell and Nora O'Connor. Transitioning solo, Weather Systems (2003) and Andrew Bird & the Mysterious Production of Eggs (2005) pioneered his signature style of looped violin, whistling, and layered folk-pop, evolving through Armchair Apocrypha (2007), Noble Beast (2009), and Break It Yourself (2012), which hit Billboard Top 10. He ventured into film scores like Norman (2010) and nature-inspired instrumentals like Echolocations: River (2017).[1][2][4][5]

Bird's style spans baroque pop and indie folk, marked by virtuosic violin, whistling, hyperliterate lyrics, and experimental looping, shifting from retro jazz to sophisticated indie. His legacy includes over 19 albums, critical acclaim for genre-defying work, and influence on indie music through live innovation and natural-world recordings.[1][2][3]
