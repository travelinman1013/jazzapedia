## Biography
Anthony Stanco, a trumpeter, composer, bandleader, and educator from Southeast Michigan, began playing trumpet in the fifth grade in the Fraser Public School System. His early musical development was profoundly shaped by Detroit's rich jazz heritage, particularly through participation in the Detroit Symphony Orchestra's Civic Jazz Program under mentors Marcus Belgrave and Rodney Whitaker during his high school years. By high school, he had established himself as a professional musician, leading his quintet at the 2006 Birmingham Jazz Festival and 2007 Detroit Jazz Festival, and being selected as the top high school soloist at the latter.[1][2][4][6]

Stanco pursued higher education at the Manhattan School of Music, studying jazz performance and privately with Laurie Frink, where he recorded on the Latin Grammy-nominated album *Kenya Revisited LIVE!* with the Afro-Cuban Jazz Orchestra directed by Bobby Sanabria in 2008. He completed his graduate degree at Michigan State University in 2014, learning from faculty like Rodney Whitaker, Reginald Thomas, Michael Dease, and Etienne Charles. His career highlights include winning first place in the International Trumpet Guild Jazz Improvisation Competition in 2013, leading The Crucial Elements on U.S. State Department tours as cultural ambassadors to over a dozen countries, and releasing albums like *The Crucial Elements* on AJS Records and *Stanco’s Time* on Origin Records in 2024, featuring collaborators such as Joe Farnsworth, Walter Blanding, and Rodney Whitaker. His style blends jazz tradition with global influences, demonstrated in performances at venues like the Java Jazz Festival and Cairo Jazz Club.[1][2][3][4][5][6]

Deeply committed to education, Stanco began teaching private students at age 12 and has since mentored at the Detroit Symphony Civic Jazz Program since 2011, Michigan State University Community Music School, Blue Lake Fine Arts Camp, Ohio State University, and as an assistant professor at Michigan State University. His legacy lies in bridging performance, composition, and pedagogy, fostering jazz's global viability while nurturing future generations from his Detroit roots.[1][2][4]
