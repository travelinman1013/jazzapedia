## Biography
Albita Rodríguez, known professionally as Albita, was born on June 6, 1962, in Havana, Cuba, into a family of accomplished folk musicians. Her parents, Martín Rodríguez and Minerva Herrera (performing as Martín y Minerva or Mima y Pipo), were well-known Cuban country music singers who exposed her to traditional Cuban folk music from an early age. Beginning her professional career as a teenager, Albita quickly distinguished herself through her contributions to the renovation of traditional Cuban music, particularly in the genres of Cuban son and guaracha. By the late 1980s, she had achieved recognition among national interpreters of Cuban folk music (Música Guajira), and released her first album, *Habrá Música Guajira* (*There Will Be Guajira Music*), in 1988.

In 1990, work commitments took Albita to Colombia, where she remained for three years before defecting to the United States on April 15, 1993, settling in Miami, Florida. Almost immediately upon arrival, she was signed by Emilio Estefan's Crescent Moon record label in 1994, launching her U.S. career with the single "Qué Manera de Quererte" ("What a Way of Loving You"), followed by her album *No Se Parece a Nada* (*Like Nothing Else*) in 1995. Her U.S. career has been marked by substantial success, including multiple Grammy and Emmy nominations and wins, with her 2004 album *Albita Llegó*, produced under her own label Angel's Dawn Records, earning her two Grammys in the category of Best Contemporary Tropical Album.

Albita has become one of the most recognized voices in the Latin music scene, known for her powerful voice, vibrant stage presence, and ability to blend traditional Cuban music with contemporary styles. She has performed extensively across Australia, Europe, Malaysia, Africa, and Latin America, and has been invited to perform at four Presidential functions, including two inaugurations. Her career demonstrates a commitment to preserving and evolving Cuban musical traditions while achieving international recognition, earning her the distinction of being considered the most authentic Cuban singer from Havana to move the world through her music.

## Fun Facts
- At age seven, Albita was already composing her own songs, asking her parents to play guitar so she could create verses, demonstrating her early prodigious talent for improvisation based on her family's tradition of payadores (Cuban improvisational folk singers).
- Albita taught herself music entirely by ear, singing in the streets, practicing, and listening to diverse music while remaining open to different cultures, rather than receiving formal musical training.
- Her 2017 single 'Se te Cayó el Tabaco' (You Dropped your Cigar), featuring a Cuban 1950s Big Band sound, immediately won a Latin Grammy upon release and became a significant hit.
- While performing in Miami's Little Havana neighborhood, Albita attracted the attention of international celebrities including Madonna, Quincy Jones, Gianni Versace, and others, which helped elevate her profile to the international stage.
