## Biography
Orlando Owoh, born Stephen Oladipupo Olaore Owomoyela (also recorded as Stephen Oladipupo Owomoyela or Abiodun Oladipupo Owomoyela) on February 14, 1932, in Osogbo, Nigeria, was a pioneering highlife musician and bandleader of Yoruba origin from the Ifon people ethnic group. His father, a carpenter and part-time musician from Ifon, influenced his early exposure to music, though Owoh initially apprenticed as a carpenter. A family conflict in 1954 led him to Lagos, where he joined bands like Dele Jolly’s Chocolate Dandies, playing drums and tom-tom, and learned guitar from Fatai Rolling Dollar. His breakthrough came in 1958 with Kola Ogunmola’s Theatre Group, performing during Queen Elizabeth's 1956 visit to Ibadan.[1][2][3][4][5]

In 1960, Owoh formed Dr. Orlando Owoh and his Omimah Band (named after his Ifon Omima hometown), releasing his debut single 'Oluwa Lo Ran Mi' ('God has sent me') on Decca Nigeria, establishing his rootsy highlife style with guttural vocals, guitar, percussion, conga drums, and call-and-response emphasizing idiophones and membranophones over sophisticated horns. His career spanned 40 years with bands like Young Kenneries (1975) and African Kenneries International, producing over 45 albums. Hits like 'Oriki Ilu Oke' post the 1967-1970 Nigerian Civil War (where he fought for the government) sustained his popularity amid rising jùjú and fùjì trends. Known as the 'King of Toye' for his unique highlife-calypso-palm wine fusion, he toured Britain in 1972 and persisted into the 2000s despite a 1980s drug imprisonment.[1][2][3][4]

Owoh's low-tech, traditional sound evoked highlife's Yoruba roots, resisting electronic shifts. He sued Decca in 2000 for royalties and remained a cultural icon until his death on November 4, 2008, buried in Agege, Lagos.[1][2][3]
