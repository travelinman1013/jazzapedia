## Biography
Jonathan David Bellion, born December 26, 1990, in Lake Grove, New York, grew up in an Italian family from Naples and initially pursued basketball before choosing music. After high school, he enrolled in the music program at Five Towns College in Dix Hills, New York, but dropped out at age 19 to focus on professional songwriting. He worked under songwriter and Warner Bros A&R executive Kara DioGuardi for a year, learning to write across genres like rock and hip hop, which honed his versatile style blending pop, hip hop, R&B, and alternative elements.[1][2][3]

Bellion's career took off with early mixtapes starting with *Scattered Thoughts Vol. 1* in 2011, followed by signing with Visionary Music Group in 2012 and releasing *Translations Through Speakers* (2013), *The Separation* (2013), and *The Definition* (2014). His debut studio album, *The Human Condition* (2016), peaked at number five on the US Billboard 200, driven by the double-platinum single 'All Time Low.' He opened for Twenty One Pilots' Emotional Roadshow World Tour and released *Glory Sound Prep* (2018), which reached number 15. As a prolific songwriter and producer, he contributed to hits like Eminem and Rihanna's 'The Monster' (Grammy winner), Jason Derulo's 'Trumpets,' and recent works for Jonas Brothers' *The Album* (2023), Maroon 5, and Tori Kelly.[1][4][5]

In 2019, Bellion founded Beautiful Mind Records, signing pop/soul band Lawrence and producing tracks for their debut album *Hotel TV* (2021). His legacy lies in his genre-fusing production and songwriting prowess, influencing modern pop while maintaining an independent creative voice through mixtapes, tours like The Glory Sound Prep Tour, and ongoing collaborations.[1][2][5]
