## Biography
Alberto Teta Lando (June 2, 1948 – July 14, 2008) was an Angolan musician born in Mbanza Congo, the capital of Zaire Province in northern Angola, to a Mukongo (Bakongo) family. His music centered on Angolan identity, the civil war, the nostalgia of exiles, young love, and family, sung in Portuguese and Kikongo. Notable songs include 'Irmão ama teu irmão' ('Brother, Love Your Brother'), 'Eu vou voltar' ('I Will Return'), 'Esperanças Idosas' ('Old Hopes'), '14 Rains', 'Tata Nketo', 'Cecília', and 'Reunir' (also known as 'Sunday Funje'). He played viola and guitar, contributing to the guitar-driven semba style prominent in Angola's independence era.[1][2][6]

Early in his career, Teta Lando performed with the group África Show alongside Massano Júnior as a guitarist. He left Angola in 1975, living in exile in Paris from 1978 to 1989, where he developed his music amid the challenges of displacement. Returning in 1989 during Fenacult, he later served as president of the National Union of Artists and Composers and reunited Angolan musicians in his final years. His discography includes 'Memórias 1968-1990', 'Tia Chica', 'Independência', 'Semba Rytmée', 'Menina de Angola', and others.[1][2][5]

Teta Lando died in Paris after battling cancer at age 60. Posthumously awarded Angola's National Prize for Culture and Arts in 2019, his legacy endures through performances of his hits by groups like Dizu Dietu Ensemble and recognition as one of northern Angola's best musicians, influencing kizomba and semba traditions.[1][2][3]
