## Biography
Andy Stein, born and raised in New York City in a family of classical musicians, began his musical journey early, surrounded by professionals including his aunt, renowned violist Lillian Fuchs. He studied violin with his pianist father and teacher Dorothy Minty, a Juilliard instructor, until age 14, playing chamber music regularly. Summers at Camp Killooleet exposed him to folk music via John Seeger, leading to old-time fiddle playing at Greenwich Village jams. In high school, he explored Renaissance music, building a harpsichord and playing viola da gamba. At the University of Michigan, where he majored in violin, he co-founded Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen, blending rock 'n' roll with blues, country, western swing, and jazz, adding swing via violin and tenor saxophone.

After moving to California with the band, Stein freelanced extensively, recording with Itzhak Perlman, Plácido Domingo, Emmylou Harris, Bob Dylan, B.B. King, Eric Clapton, and others, earning a Grammy for Best Country Instrumental in 1978 for 'One O'Clock Jump' with Asleep at the Wheel. He performed on Broadway in revivals like 'Fiddler on the Roof,' appeared on TV shows including Late Night with David Letterman and Saturday Night Live, and served 22 years as violinist/saxophonist in the Guys All-Star Shoe Band on A Prairie Home Companion with Garrison Keillor. His style mastery spans classical, rock, jazz, gypsy, tango, and country, rooted in chamber music training.

As a composer and arranger, Stein scored films for Roger Corman and National Lampoon, wrote an opera with Garrison Keillor, arranged for pops orchestras worldwide, and transcribed Duke Ellington works. His arrangement opens Paul McCartney's 1999 album Working Classical. Featured in Robert Altman's A Prairie Home Companion film and Ken Burns documentaries, Stein's versatile legacy bridges genres, from Native American events on Alcatraz to performances for U.S. presidents.
