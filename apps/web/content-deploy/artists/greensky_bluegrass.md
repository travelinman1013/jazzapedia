## Biography
Greensky Bluegrass is a five-piece American band formed in the fall of 2000 in Kalamazoo, Michigan, by mandolinist Paul Hoffman, guitarist Dave Bruzza, and banjoist Michael Arlen Bont, who debuted as a trio at a house party on October 31, 2000, and an open mic night. As newcomers to bluegrass, they drew from diverse influences including Phish, Grateful Dead, and Jerry Garcia's acoustic work, blending traditional bluegrass with rock & roll's rule-breaking spirit to create their unique 'newgrass' sound characterized by acoustic stomp, improvisation, and original songwriting.[1][2][3][5] Bassist Mike Devol joined in 2004 after initially helping with promotion, followed by dobro player Anders Beck in 2007, expanding the lineup and musical palette.[1][2][4]

The band's career gained momentum with their 2004 debut album Less than Supper, followed by Tuesday Letter in 2006, the same year they won the Telluride Bluegrass Festival Band Competition, securing a main stage spot in 2007. They released live album Live at Bell’s in 2007, Shouted, Written Down & Quoted in 2016, All For Money in 2019, and Stress Dreams in 2020, co-produced with Dominic John Davis and Glenn Brown during the pandemic. Known for relentless North American tours, they achieved feats like selling out three nights at Red Rocks and maintaining independence with Billboard Bluegrass chart success.[1][3][4][6]

Greensky Bluegrass has evolved into a marquee live act, transcending genres with extravagant improvisations modeled after rock spectacles rather than traditional bluegrass, supported by a grassroots audience passionate about outdoors, craft beer, and danceable music. Their legacy includes 25 years of innovation, connecting with regional Michigan scenes and redefining bluegrass for modern fans.[2][5][7]
