## Biography
Abbey Toyyib Elias, professionally known as Skiibii (sometimes stylized as Skiibi or Skiibii Mayana), was born on July 5, 1992, in Lagos, Nigeria, specifically in the Surulere neighborhood. Growing up in a music-loving family, including an uncle involved in the Nigerian band Blackky and the Afrobeats, Skiibii developed a passion for music during his high school years at Wuse II High School, where he joined a music group with friends and initially rapped before transitioning to R&B and afro-pop. He graduated from Ekiti State University (also referred to as University of Ado Ekiti) with a degree in mass communication, overcoming parental opposition to pursue music full-time.[1][2][3]
