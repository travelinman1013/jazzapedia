## Biography
Caleb Klauder and Reeb Willms, both originally from Washington State—Caleb from the coastal San Juan Islands (raised on Orcas Island) and Reeb from the high desert plateau of Douglas County—began their musical journeys in the Pacific Northwest. Caleb, a master of mandolin, fiddle, and guitar, founded the Foghorn Stringband, a gold standard in old-time string band music, and led the Caleb Klauder Country Band for over 20 years. Reeb, skilled on rhythm guitar and fiddle, started playing traditional and old-time music while in college in Bellingham, Washington, where she was inspired by groups like the Foghorn Stringband. They met through the vibrant Northwest scene, eventually forming a duo known for soulful harmonies, original songs, and covers that evoke early 20th-century rural American music.[1][2][3][7][10]

The duo, often performing as Caleb Klauder & Reeb Willms or with their Country Band, relocated from Portland, Oregon—where they were foundational to the old-time and country music scene—to the San Juan Islands. They tour extensively (over 250 days a year), blending bluegrass, honky-tonk, and roots country with intuitive interplay reminiscent of legendary pairs like Rawlings and Welch or Harris and Parsons. Caleb has written over 50 songs that have become standards in honky-tonk and bluegrass circles, recorded by numerous artists. Albums include 'Oh Do You Remember' (2011), 'Innocent Road' (2016), and 'Gold in Your Pocket,' recorded in Nashville and Louisiana studios with guests like Chris Scruggs and Joel Savoy.[1][2][3][5]

Pillars of the West Coast roots music community, they perform worldwide as a duo, with the Foghorn Stringband, or expanded bands like the Caleb Klauder Reeb Willms Country Band and Cali Cutups, featuring musicians such as Zach Sharpe (bass), Jack Kinney (banjo), and Brandon Godman (fiddle). Their unpretentious authenticity and dedication to traditional sounds continue to captivate audiences at festivals like Telluride Bluegrass and their own East Sound Music Ramble.[1][3][4]
