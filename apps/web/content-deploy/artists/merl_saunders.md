# Merl Saunders

## Biography
Merl Saunders (February 14, 1934 – October 24, 2008) was born in San Mateo, California, and raised in San Francisco, where he attended Polytechnic High School and played in a band with singer Johnny Mathis. After serving in the U.S. Air Force from 1953 to 1957, he worked as musical director for the Billy Williams Revue and Oscar Brown Jr.'s off-Broadway show *Big Time Buck White*, which starred Muhammad Ali. Saunders honed his skills on piano and the Hammond B-3 organ, drawing from jazz organists like Jimmy Smith, and released early singles and albums on Fantasy and Galaxy Records while gigging in the Bay Area with cousin Eddie Moore on drums.

In the 1970s, Saunders' career shifted dramatically after meeting Jerry Garcia at The Matrix nightclub in 1971, leading to prolific collaborations including the Saunders/Garcia Band (later Legion of Mary with Martin Fierro), Reconstruction, and albums like *Heavy Turbulence* (1972) and *Fire Up* (1973). He led Merl Saunders and Friends with guests like Mike Bloomfield, David Grisman, Tom Fogerty, Vassar Clements, John Kahn, and Sheila E., and worked with Grateful Dead's Mickey Hart in High Noon. His style blended jazz, blues, rock, and later world music, notably in the 1990 album *Blues from the Rainforest* with Garcia and Muruga Booker, inspiring a Rainforest Band series focused on environmental themes. Saunders also composed for TV (*The Twilight Zone*, *Nash Bridges*), films (*Fritz the Cat*), and events like the Grammy Awards.

Saunders' legacy endures as a jam band elder, guesting with Phish, Blues Traveler, and Widespread Panic, leading the Haight Street Fair jam for 25 years, and reintroducing Garcia to guitar post-1986 coma. He ran Sumertone Records (named for children Susan, Merl Jr., and Tony) and influenced the fusion of Grateful Dead improvisation with jazz organ grooves.

## Fun Facts
- Saunders was born in a San Francisco Catholic orphanage because his 18-year-old mother was pregnant and disowned by her family; his father returned from playing with Lionel Hampton to raise the family.
- He led the Haight-Ashbury Street Fair jam session for a quarter century and played solo piano in small clubs, showcasing his versatility.
- In 1986, Saunders helped reintroduce Jerry Garcia to playing guitar after Garcia's diabetic coma.
- One track from his album *Blues from the Rainforest* was featured in the *Baywatch* TV series soundtrack.
