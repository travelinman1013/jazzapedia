## Biography
Siouxsie and the Banshees were formed in London in 1976 by vocalist Siouxsie Sioux (born Susan Ballion) and bassist Steven Severin, who met at a Roxy Music concert in 1975 amid dissatisfaction with the post-glam rock scene. They gained notoriety by performing an impromptu 20-minute improvisation of 'The Lord's Prayer' at the 100 Club Punk Festival on September 20, 1976, with borrowed musicians Marco Pirroni on guitar and Sid Vicious on drums, marking their chaotic entry into the punk scene as part of the Bromley Contingent. Initially punk-associated, the band evolved rapidly with guitarist John McKay and drummer Kenny Morris, releasing their debut single 'Hong Kong Garden' in 1978, which reached the UK top 10, followed by the critically acclaimed album The Scream, pioneering post-punk with daring rhythmic and sonic experimentation.[1][2][3][5]

The band's lineup shifted after Join Hands (1979), with McKay and Morris departing; they recruited drummer Budgie and guitarist John McGeoch (ex-Magazine), steering toward alternative pop success in the 1980s. Albums like Kaleidoscope (1980, UK #5), Juju (1981, top 10), and Peepshow (1988) showcased their influence on gothic rock, blending post-punk, darkwave, and pop elements, while 'Kiss Them for Me' (1991) became a US mainstream hit. Siouxsie and Severin remained the constants through 11 studio albums and 30 singles, despite changes, embodying an audacious post-punk spirit as praised by The Times.[1][4][5]

Disbanding in 1996 after two decades, Siouxsie and Budgie continued as The Creatures, a side project from the early 1980s, while Siouxsie launched a solo career in 2004 with Mantaray. Their legacy as post-punk pioneers shaped gothic rock, alternative scenes, and acts like Radiohead and The Smiths, who lauded McGeoch's contributions.[1][2][4]
