## Biography
TV on the Radio is an American indie rock band formed in 2001 in Brooklyn, New York, by Tunde Adebimpe (vocals, loops) and David Andrew Sitek (guitars, keyboards, loops), who met at a bar and bonded over shared musical tastes, releasing their first self-titled project as the lo-fi cassette OK Calculator, a nod to Radiohead's OK Computer.[1][2][4][5] Kyp Malone (vocals, guitars, bass, loops) joined soon after, leading to the 2003 EP Young Liars and their debut album Desperate Youth, Blood Thirsty Babes in 2004, which earned the Shortlist Music Prize and established their experimental sound blending indie rock, art rock, and diverse influences.[1][2][3] The band expanded with Jaleel Bunton on drums and Gerard Smith on bass/keyboards in 2005, releasing Return to Cookie Mountain (2006), the critically acclaimed Dear Science (2008)—named best album of the year by outlets like Rolling Stone and The Guardian—and Nine Types of Light (2011), though tragedy struck with Smith's death in 2011.[1][2][3]

Their musical style evolved from raw, loop-heavy experiments to polished yet innovative art rock, incorporating horns, samplers, and layered vocals, with Seeds (2014) marking their latest studio album amid lineup shifts, including Sitek's current inactivity.[1][2][3] TV on the Radio gained prominence through TV appearances on Saturday Night Live, The Colbert Report, and Later... with Jools Holland, headlining festivals like All Tomorrow's Parties in 2013 where they debuted new material.[2][3] The band's legacy endures as pioneers of Brooklyn's early 2000s rock resurgence alongside acts like The Strokes and Yeah Yeah Yeahs, earning Grammy nominations and praise for pushing genre boundaries.[3][4]
