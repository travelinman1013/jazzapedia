## Biography
Esther Mae Phillips (born Esther Mae Jones on December 23, 1935, in Galveston, Texas) was an American R&B and jazz vocalist who rose to prominence as a teenage prodigy in the early 1950s. Discovered by bandleader Johnny Otis at a talent contest in 1949 at the Barrelhouse Club in Watts, Los Angeles, she became the youngest artist ever to reach number 1 on the R&B charts when "Double Crossing Blues" became a massive hit in 1950. Billed as "Little Esther," she quickly followed with additional chart-topping hits including "Mistrustin' Blues" and "Cupid's Boogie," establishing herself as a formidable force in rhythm and blues during her early touring years with Otis's California Rhythm and Blues Caravan from 1949 through 1952.

Phillips's career experienced significant disruption due to heroin addiction throughout the 1960s, but she demonstrated remarkable resilience by reinventing herself multiple times. In 1963, adopting the stage name "Esther Phillips" (reportedly inspired by a Phillips gasoline station sign), she achieved a major comeback with the country-influenced hit "Release Me," which reached number 1 on the R&B charts. She signed with Atlantic Records in 1965 and appeared on a BBC-TV program with the Beatles that same year, while also recording jazz-inflected blues albums including *Burnin'* and *Confessin' the Blues*. After undergoing drug rehabilitation treatment in the late 1960s, she re-signed with Atlantic and subsequently recorded for Kudu Records (part of Creed Taylor's CTI empire) beginning in 1971, where she created some of her most acclaimed work, including the autobiographical album *Home Is Where the Hatred Is* (1972), which earned her a Grammy nomination in 1973.

Despite continued recording and performance activity throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, Phillips struggled to maintain commercial success in her later years. Famed critic Leonard Feather hailed her as "the indisputable queen of the blues" in a nightclub review less than a year before her death. She died of kidney and liver failure on August 7, 1984, in Carson, California, at age 48, leaving behind a complex legacy as a pioneering R&B vocalist whose career trajectory reflected both the heights of early success and the devastating impact of addiction on artistic longevity.
