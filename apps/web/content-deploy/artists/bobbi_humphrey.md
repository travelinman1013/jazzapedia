## Biography
Bobbi Humphrey, born Barbara Ann Humphrey on April 25, 1950, in Marlin, Texas, and raised in South Dallas, began playing flute in high school at Lincoln High School, honing her skills to such a degree that she earned a full music scholarship to Texas Southern University (1968–70) and later attended Southern Methodist University (1970–71). There, jazz legend Dizzy Gillespie spotted her talent during a school competition and urged her to move to New York City, where she quickly made her mark—jamming with Duke Ellington just three days after arriving and becoming the first woman signed to Blue Note Records in 1971. She studied privately with flutist Hubert Laws and recorded six albums for Blue Note between 1971 and 1976, including hits like Blacks and Blues (1973) and Satin Doll (1974), blending jazz funk, jazz fusion, and soul jazz while earning acclaim as the 'First Lady of the Flute.'

Humphrey's career evolved as she transitioned from pure jazz to a more commercially viable urban-pop and fusion sound, signing with Epic Records in 1977 and releasing Tailor Made that year, while also contributing flute to Stevie Wonder's Songs in the Key of Life. She formed her own publishing company, Bobbi Humphrey Music Company, and management firm, Innovative Artist Management, in 1977, and later launched Paradise Sounds Records in 1994. Awards poured in, including Best Flutist in Ebony Magazine's readers' poll (1975–77), Best Female Instrumentalist by Billboard and Record World (1976, 1978), and the Key to New Orleans (1977), with standout performances like her 'surprise hit' status at the 1973 Montreux Jazz Festival.

Today, Humphrey continues to tour internationally, maintaining her status as a pioneering female flutist in jazz and fusion, self-describing her style as 'African American classical music' that prioritizes meaningful, enjoyable music and financial success. Her legacy endures through decades of innovation, business acumen, and influence on smooth jazz-pop.
