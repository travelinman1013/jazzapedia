## Biography
Mavis John, born in Clifton Hill, Tobago, began her musical career at age 16 and quickly rose to prominence as the 'soul queen' of the Caribbean, becoming a teen idol in the 1960s and 1970s with hits like 'It’s a Man’s World,' 'Come By Here Boy,' 'We Are Gonna Make It,' and 'I’ll Be Your Friend.' She relocated to Belmont, Trinidad, establishing a long-term home there, and enchanted audiences with her renditions of jazz, blues, soul, and calypso while performing at major events across the Caribbean and North America, including the St. Vincent & The Grenadines Blues Festival and St. Kitts Music Festival.[1][2][3][4]

After pausing her singing career to focus on marriage, motherhood, and her role as a schoolteacher, John returned to the arts in the 1980s through theatre, starring in acclaimed productions such as Derek Walcott's 'Marie La Veau,' 'A Nancy Story' by Trinidad Theatre Workshop, 'Cinderama' at Little Carib Theatre, and 'Shades of I-She,' for which she won a 1996 Cacique Award. Her musical resurgence came in the late 1990s with her solo concert 'Overdue' in 1998 and the critically acclaimed 2001 album 'Mavis Sings,' featuring jazz and kaiso covers like 'Education' by Mighty Sparrow and originals such as 'The Time Is Now' and 'You Are What Love Is.'[2][3]

Known for her versatile voice blending soul, jazz, blues, and Caribbean styles, John has shared stages with international stars like Jeffrey Osborne, The Temptations, The Manhattans, Ashanti, Shaggy, and Third World, as well as Carla Thomas, Eddie Grant, Jean Knight, and Percy Sledge. As a veteran performer, songwriter, actress, and educator, her legacy endures through consistent regional and international appearances into the 2000s.[1][2][3]
