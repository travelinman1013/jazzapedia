## Biography
Arturo R. Molina Jr., born May 31, 1964, in Windsor, California, was raised by his grandmother Lola Molina there before moving with his mother to Los Angeles; he occasionally lived on military bases in Guam and Germany due to family ties and is of Mexican descent. He began his music career in 1982 as Kid Frost, adopting the name as a tribute to his rival Ice-T, with whom he often battled; his early DJs were Dr. Dre and DJ Yella, and he became a breakdancer for Uncle Jamm's Army. In the mid-1980s, he released pre-gangsta 12" singles on Electrobeat and Baja Records, transitioning to Virgin Records in the late 1980s.[1][2][3]

Frost's breakthrough came with his 1990 debut album *Hispanic Causing Panic*, credited as the first Chicano rap and Latin hip-hop album, featuring the hit single 'La Raza,' which reached #6 on Billboard's Rap Songs chart and became an East L.A. anthem blending Spanglish, low-rider culture, and barrio pride. He formed the rap supergroup Latin Alliance, releasing their self-titled album in 1991, followed by solo albums like *East Side Story* (1992). Dropping 'Kid' in 1995, he signed with Ruthless Records (Eazy-E's label), releasing *Smile Now, Die Later* (1995) and *When Hell.A. Freezes Over* (1997), then continued with independent labels, producing albums like *Welcome to Frost Angeles* (2004, mostly with son Scoop DeVille) and others into the 2010s.[1][3][4]

Known for West Coast hip-hop, G-funk, gangster rap, Latin hip-hop, and Mexican hip-hop, Frost's style emphasized Chicano identity and East L.A. elements, paving the way for Latin rappers. He charted on the Billboard 200 multiple times, appeared in Snoop Dogg's 'Vato' video, collaborated widely, became vice president of Goldmark Industries' Music Division in 2006, and announced a gallbladder cancer diagnosis in 2016. Father to producer Scoop DeVille, his legacy endures as a pioneer of Chicano rap.[1][3][5]
