## Biography
Justice is a French electronic music duo formed in Paris in 2003, consisting of Gaspard Augé (born 21 May 1979 in Besançon, Doubs) and Xavier de Rosnay (born 2 July 1982 in Ozoir-la-Ferrière, Seine-et-Marne). They first collaborated on tracks for the Musclorvision compilation 'Hits Up To You,' mimicking Eurovision-style songs, and gained prominence with their 2003 remix of Simian's 'Never Be Alone' for a Paris college radio contest. Signed to Ed Banger Records and managed by Pedro Winter, the duo fused electronic music with strong rock, indie, disco, and pop influences, characterized by pulsating beats, distorted basslines, synthesizers, drum machines, and sampling techniques.[1][2][5]

Their debut album, '†' (Cross), released in 2007, earned critical acclaim, a Grammy for Best Dance/Electronic Album, and featured hits like 'D.A.N.C.E.' and 'Stress.' Subsequent releases included 'Audio, Video, Disco' (2011), the live album 'Access All Arenas' (2013), 'Woman' (2016), and 'Woman Worldwide' (2018), which won another Grammy for Best Electronic/Dance Album in 2019. Justice became renowned for electrifying live performances with visually stunning stage setups, headlining festivals like Coachella in 2024 to promote 'Hyperdrama.'[1][3][5]

Justice's legacy as 21st-century electronic pioneers stems from their genre-transcending innovation, immersive shows influenced by visual artists like James Turrell, and enduring impact on the Parisian electro scene and global audiences.[1][3][6]
