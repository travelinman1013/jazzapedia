## Biography
Mary Elizabeth 'Bessie' Jones (February 8, 1902 – July 17, 1984) was born in Smithville, Georgia, and moved to Dawson as an infant, growing up in a musical Gullah-Geechee family immersed in rural traditions. Her grandfather, Jet Sampson, a former slave born in Africa, taught her field songs, stories of slavery, and 'the old ways,' while her mother played autoharp and family members crafted guitars and banjos. Jones left school at age 10, married Cassius Davis at 12, had a daughter, and later moved to St. Simons Island after his death in 1926, where she joined the Spiritual Singers Society of Coastal Georgia in 1933 and became a community teacher of songs, games, dances, and spiritual music.[1][2][3][4]

Her career gained prominence in 1959 when folklorist Alan Lomax recorded her during fieldwork in the Georgia Sea Islands, recognizing her passion to preserve African-American traditions. In 1961, she traveled to New York for further recordings now in the Lomax archive, and in 1963 formed the Georgia Sea Island Singers, touring extensively at venues like Carnegie Hall, Newport Folk Festival, Smithsonian Folklife Festivals, and performing at the Poor People’s March on Washington (1968) and President Jimmy Carter’s inauguration (1977). Her style blended gospel, folk, country blues, and Gullah ring shouts, emphasizing a cappella group singing, call-and-response, and joyful spirituals rooted in slave ancestry.[1][2][3][7]

Jones released solo albums *So Glad I'm Here* (1973) and *Step It Down* (1975), continued performing into the 1970s, and received the 1982 National Endowment for the Arts National Heritage Fellowship and Duke Ellington Fellowship at Yale. She dedicated her life to educating wider audiences about Black history through music, earning praise from Lomax as the 'Mother Courage of American Black traditions.' She died in Brunswick, Georgia, leaving a legacy of preserved Gullah-Geechee culture.[1][2][3][6]
