## Biography
Larry Darnell, born Leo Edward Donald (or Leo Edward Donald, Jr.) on December 21, 1928, in Columbus, Ohio, began his musical journey as a gospel singer, gaining local fame by age 11. At 15, he left home to tour as a dancer with Irwin C. Miller's Brownskin Models burlesque road show, but soon settled in New Orleans, performing at the renowned Dew Drop Inn where he adopted his stage name and honed a charismatic R&B style backed by Edgar Blanchard's Gondoliers house band.[1][2][3]

Discovered in 1949 by Regal Records' Fred Mendelsohn during a performance of 'I'll Get Along Somehow,' Darnell quickly rose to prominence with hits like 'For You My Love' (No. 1 on Billboard R&B for eight weeks) and 'I'll Get Along Somehow' (No. 2), blending powerful vocals, passionate delivery, and spoken recitations that influenced early rock & roll. Nicknamed 'Mr. Heart & Soul,' he recorded for labels including Okeh, Savoy, Deluxe, Warwick, and Argo through the 1950s, appeared in the 1955 film *Harlem Rock & Roll Revue*, and possibly made lost Motown recordings in Detroit during the early 1960s. His work helped shape New Orleans R&B.[1][2][3]

Darnell's career waned in later years; his final recording was in 1969 for Instant Records. In 1979, he survived a severe mugging en route to a funeral, revealing lung cancer during surgery; one lung was removed in 1980, but he performed once more in 1981 before dying on July 3, 1983, at age 54 in Columbus. Despite early success, he remains best remembered for his 1949-1950 hits.[1][2]
