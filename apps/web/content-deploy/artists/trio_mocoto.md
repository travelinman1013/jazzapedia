## Biography
Trio Mocotó, a pioneering Brazilian band, was formed in 1968 at the Jogral nightclub in São Paulo by Fritz Escovão (vocalist and guitarist), João Parahyba (vocalist and drummer), and Nereu Gargalo (vocalist and percussionist). They gained prominence as the backing band for Jorge Ben, contributing to his seminal albums *Fôrça Bruta* (1969), *Negro É Lindo*, and *A Tábua de Esmeralda*, where they helped pioneer the samba-rock or sambalanço style—a fusion of samba, funk, soul, and rock rhythms. Their work at Jogral also involved supporting legends like Clementina de Jesus, Nelson Cavaquinho, Cartola, and international jazz figures such as Dizzy Gillespie, Duke Ellington, and Oscar Peterson, blending Brazilian grooves with global influences.[2][3][1]

The trio released their own albums starting in the early 1970s, including *Muita Zorra* (1971), *Trio Mocotó* (1973 and 1977), and scored a hit with 'Coqueiro Verde' (written by Erasmo Carlos) in 1971. After a hiatus of over two decades, they reformed in 2000, releasing *Samba Rock* (2001) and *Beleza, Beleza, Beleza!* (2003), followed by European tours and festival appearances. Skowa joined in 2003, replacing Fritz, but both passed away in 2024—Skowa from cardiac arrest in June and Fritz in October. Today, the band continues with original members João Parahyba and Nereu Gargalo alongside Melvin Santhana.[2][1][3]

Trio Mocotó's legacy lies in shaping samba-rock, influencing Brazilian black music and fusions of samba with American pop elements. They earned the APCA award for Best Group in 2001 and Nereu Gargalo's *Samba Power* won Best Album in 2006, cementing their enduring impact on Brazilian music.[2][4]
