## Biography
Ronnie Baker Brooks, born Rodney Dion Baker on January 23, 1967, in Chicago, Illinois, grew up immersed in the Chicago blues scene as the son of legendary blues musician Lonnie Brooks. He received his first guitar at age nine from his father and made his stage debut playing alongside him that year. After graduating from Hales Franciscan High School in 1985, he joined his father's band initially as a roadie and bassist in 1986, progressing to guitarist. His recording debut came on Lonnie's 1988 live album *Live from Chicago: Bayou Lightning Strikes* on Alligator Records, followed by participation in the label's 20th Anniversary Tour with artists like Koko Taylor, Elvin Bishop, and Lil' Ed Williams.[1][3][5][6]

By 1998, Brooks launched his solo career with *Golddigger* on Watchdog Records, produced by Janet Jackson, earning a 2000 Blues Music Award nomination for Best New Artist. Subsequent albums included *Take Me Witcha* (2001), *The Torch* (2006, featuring Lonnie Brooks, Eddy Clearwater, and others, produced by Jellybean Johnson), *Times Have Changed* (2017), and his Alligator debut *Blues in My DNA* (2024), produced by Jim Gaines. The latter won Blues Music Awards for Song of the Year ('Blues in My DNA'), Contemporary Blues Album of the Year, and Contemporary Blues Male Artist of the Year. His style blends Chicago blues, soul blues, blues rock, and elements of rock, funk, and soul, marked by powerful guitar work, soulful vocals, and high-energy performances.[1][3][4][8]

Brooks has performed at major events like the Notodden Blues Festival (2007), Memphis in May, and Musikfest (2009), and headlined the Chicago Blues Festival multiple times, including opening with Shemekia Copeland in 2024. He resides in Dolton, Illinois, and regularly performs at Chicago's Odyssey East Lounge when not touring. From 2007-2010, he toured with band members Carlton Armstrong, C.J. Anthony Tucker, and Steve Nixon, occasionally as the Brooks Family Band with his father and brother Wayne Baker Brooks.[1]
