## Biography
The Quickening is a New Orleans-based jam band formed in 2012 by guitarist, singer, and songwriter Blake Quick after he parted ways with the local funk band Flow Tribe, which had appeared on MTV's The Real World in 2011. Quick assembled a core lineup featuring vocalist and guitarist Rachel 'Mama Ray' Murray, whom he met through a mutual friend during her first visit to New Orleans; she sang with his band at a gig and later relocated from Florida to join him permanently. The rhythm section includes bassist Al Small (sometimes listed as Scott Sibley in early descriptions) and drummers like Jeff Jani or Scott Sibley, with a revolving cast of additional musicians adding horns, pedal steel guitar by Dave Easley, woodwinds, and strings for rich improvisational textures.[1][2][5]

The band's musical style blends soulful grooves, exploratory jamming inspired by the Grateful Dead's storytelling and improvisation, folk elements from artists like Joni Mitchell, and deep soul influences including Sam Cooke, Donny Hathaway, Chaka Khan, Roberta Flack, D’Angelo, Sharon Jones, Marvin Gaye, Etta James, and Ray Charles. Known for 'feel good music' with lush vocal harmonies between Quick and Murray that create a seamless partnership, The Quickening has released three full-length albums and earned acclaim as one of New Orleans' top live jam bands, performing at venues like Tipitina’s and The Broadside. Their sound emphasizes groove, chemistry, and spontaneous energy, spreading from local stages to broader U.S. audiences.[1][2]

While still building a national profile, The Quickening's legacy lies in revitalizing New Orleans' jam and soul scene post-Flow Tribe, fostering a communal, hippie-hearted vibe that prioritizes live performance and musical evolution. Blake Quick views music as a metaphor for life's peaks and valleys, driving the band's ongoing growth and impact in the Crescent City's vibrant music community.[2]
