## Biography
Mara Hruby is an Oakland, California-born singer-songwriter who emerged as a rising force in the indie-soul and alternative jazz genres in the early 2010s. Beginning her professional music career in 2010 with her debut EP "From Her Eyes," Hruby quickly gained recognition for her distinctive approach to reinterpreting classic soul and jazz standards originally performed by male artists, adding her own feminine perspective and emotional depth to songs by artists such as Bob Marley, D'Angelo, Jamiroquai, and Mos Def. Her debut EP achieved over 80,000 downloads and established her as an acoustic soul up-and-comer with a loyal following.

Hruby's musical style draws inspiration from vintage influences including Julie London, Patsy Cline, The Moonglows, Curtis Mayfield, and Brook Benton, creating a sound that blends 1940s and 1950s aesthetics with contemporary sensibilities. Her sophomore EP "Archaic Rapture," released in 2014, showcased her growth as an artist and received recognition from Billboard, which premiered her single "Cry Me A River" as a live studio performance. The project reached the #1 spot on iTunes Jazz charts within its first week of release. Beyond music, Hruby is a multifaceted creative who has worked as a dancer, model, and craftsperson, and she actively advocates for women in the arts through her #PowerWomenUnite initiative.

Throughout her career, Hruby has performed at prestigious venues including Yoshi's Oakland, Blue Note Jazz Club in New York City, and major festivals such as the Long Beach Jazz Festival (2015), Grammy Weekend (2012 & 2016), and the Stern Grove Festival (2012). Her work emphasizes authenticity, emotional honesty, and the importance of women supporting one another in creative fields.
