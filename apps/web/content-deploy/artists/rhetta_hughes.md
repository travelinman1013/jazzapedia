## Biography
Rhetta Hughes (June 15, 1939 – June 3, 2019) was born in Dallas, Texas, where she sang in a Baptist church choir from a young age but initially pursued nursing, working at Parkland Memorial Hospital. Her career pivot came in 1963 after an impromptu performance at a Dallas club where her friend Tennyson Stephens played piano, leading to her hiring as a lounge singer. Spotted by Al Williams of the Four Step Brothers, she and Stephens moved to the Chicago nightclub circuit, marking her entry into professional music.
