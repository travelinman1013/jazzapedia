## Biography
Jack Kelly, a singer and guitarist born around 1900 in northern Mississippi, moved to Memphis, Tennessee, in the 1920s, where he established himself as a street musician in the vibrant jug band scene. He initially collaborated with guitarist Frank Stokes, Dan Sane, and fiddler Will Batts, later forming the South Memphis Jug Band in the early 1930s by adding jug player 'Doctor' D.M. Higgs. The band's music blended **country blues**, ragtime, and string band elements, characterized by Kelly's basic chording and medium-tempo picking complemented by Sane's bass runs, Batts' plaintive fiddling, and Higgs' sonorous jug.[1][2][3]

The group made their recording debut on August 1-3, 1933, in New York for Banner and ARC, cutting around two dozen sides including 'Highway 61 Blues' and 'Ko Ko Mo Blues,' which captured the uninhibited energy of country juke joints. In 1939, Kelly and Batts returned to the studio without Sane and Higgs, possibly with an unidentified guitarist like Little Son Joe, shifting to a more lyrical and topical style in tracks like 'Joe Louis Special' and 'Diamond Buyer,' evoking post-Depression themes. Throughout the 1940s and 1950s, Kelly continued performing in Memphis, teaming up with harmonica player Walter Horton and recording two unreleased sides for Sun Records in 1952 as Jackie Boy and Little Walter.[1][2]

Kelly remained active in Memphis until his death around 1960, contributing to the city's rich jug band tradition alongside groups like the Memphis Jug Band, Gus Cannon's Jug Stompers, and Jed Davenport's Beale Street Jug Band. His work exemplified the Memphis sound, favoring blues-based material with a 'country blues' flavor, though commercial interest waned as urban styles rose. Today, his recordings are valued for their musical excellence and historical insight into prewar Southern string bands.[1][2][4]

## Fun Facts
- In 1952, Jack Kelly and Walter Horton recorded two numbers for Sun Records as 'Jackie Boy and Little Walter,' but the tracks (Sun 174) remained unreleased until acetates were discovered decades later.[1][2]
- Kelly's 1939 recordings shifted dramatically after dropping the jug and second guitarist, adopting a sound reminiscent of the Frank Stokes-Dan Sane partnership, with more profound lyrics on topics like Joe Louis and Depression-era hardships.[1]
- The South Memphis Jug Band was one of four major Memphis jug bands with significant recording careers, alongside Will Shade’s Memphis Jug Band, Gus Cannon’s Jug Stompers, and Jed Davenport’s Beale Street Jug Band.[1]
- Kelly may have backed Little Buddy Doyle on 1939 sides and Joe Hill Louis later, showcasing his role as a versatile session musician beyond his bandleading.[2]
