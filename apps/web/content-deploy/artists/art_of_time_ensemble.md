## Biography
Art of Time Ensemble is a Toronto-based chamber music collective founded in 1998 by artistic director Andrew Burashko with the vision of blurring the boundaries between high art and popular culture.[1][3] The ensemble was created as an outlet to explore the intersection of classical music and contemporary genres, bringing orchestral music out of its traditional silo and giving it contemporary relevance.[1][6] Over its 25-year history, Art of Time Ensemble has produced over 80 unique productions and recordings, toured extensively throughout North America and Europe, and become a fixture on Toronto's cultural landscape.[1][3]

The ensemble comprises some of Canada's top classical and jazz soloists, concertmasters, and principal players from major orchestras around the world.[1] Art of Time has gained wide acclaim for its thoughtful and challenging programming that juxtaposes diverse artistic genres, attracting audiences across traditional boundaries.[3] The ensemble's collaborative roster reads like a who's who of Canadian cultural figures and international artists, including authors Margaret Atwood and Michael Ondaatje, jazz legend Branford Marsalis, vocalists Madeleine Peyroux and Sarah Slean, and members of The Cowboy Junkies and Barenaked Ladies.[1][2]

In May 2023, Burashko announced the 25th anniversary season lineup along with the culmination of the Art of Time Ensemble itself, marking the end of an era that fundamentally transformed how audiences experience music performance in Canada.[4]

## Fun Facts
- Andrew Burashko was born in Moscow into a family of musicians and made his solo debut with the Toronto Symphony Orchestra at just 17 years old.[3][4]
- The Art of Time Ensemble grew from a modest beginning—the first season (1999/2000) consisted of just three one-nighters with no infrastructure, relying on Burashko personally calling musicians to invite them.[5]
- The ensemble's budget grew exponentially from approximately $60,000 in 2005 (when they moved to Harbourfront and began doing four shows of two-nighters) to over a million dollars by the time of its 25th anniversary.[5]
- Art of Time Ensemble produced a notable performance of The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, with the original 2012 production featuring members of Skydiggers and other Canadian artists.[2]
