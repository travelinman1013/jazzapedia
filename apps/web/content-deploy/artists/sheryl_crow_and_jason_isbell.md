## Biography
Sheryl Crow, born February 11, 1962, in Kennett, Missouri, began her career as a backing vocalist for artists like Michael Jackson before achieving breakthrough success with her 1993 album *Tuesday Night Music Club*, which became a word-of-mouth hit and launched her into stardom with hits like 'All I Want to Do.'[5] She developed a roots-rock style blending pop, rock, and country influences, collaborating with major figures such as the Rolling Stones, Eric Clapton, B.B. King, and Tony Bennett, while selling an estimated 50 million albums worldwide.[5] Crow has overcome personal health challenges, including non-invasive breast cancer and a benign meningioma, and continued evolving her sound, as seen in her 2019 album *Threads*, which featured duets with contemporary artists.[5][2]

In her later career, Crow signed with Big Machine Label Group in 2019 to release *Threads*, a duets album including collaborations with Stevie Nicks, Maren Morris, Bonnie Raitt, Mavis Staples, Neil Young, Lukas Nelson, Margo Price, Don Henley, Johnny Cash (via his cover of her song), and Jason Isbell on the Bob Dylan cover 'Everything Is Broken.'[2][5] She performed this track live with Isbell on *The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon* in 2019 and shared stages with him in events like 'The Art of Music' series, where he interviewed her about her creative process and accompanied her on classics like 'Every Day is a Winding Road' and 'My Favorite Mistake.'[1][2][3] Crow's work reflects a commitment to authentic songwriting, often addressing personal and global issues, as discussed in her conversations with Isbell.[1]

Crow's legacy endures as a versatile singer-songwriter who bridges rock and country, inspiring peers in Nashville and beyond through her resilience and collaborative spirit, with Isbell publicly citing her as an aspiration.[1][5] Her influence persists in modern roots-rock, evidenced by her ongoing projects and public television features highlighting her journey.[4]
