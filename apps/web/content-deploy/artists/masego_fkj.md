## Biography
Micah Davis, known professionally as Masego, was born on June 8, 1993, in Jamaica to pastor parents and raised in Newport News, Virginia, after his family settled there from military moves. He began playing piano young, learned saxophone in middle school to impress a teacher—practicing religiously and joining the swim team for lung strength—and became largely self-taught via YouTube tutorials, blending R&B, hip-hop, and jazz into his signature 'TrapHouseJazz' style. Denied a music scholarship at Old Dominion University for lacking classical training, he started producing in college, inspired by Pharrell and Ryan Leslie, and posted spontaneous tracks like '73 degrees' on SoundCloud.[1][2][3][4]

Masego's career surged in 2015 with the collaborative EP *The Pink Polo EP* alongside producer Medasin, featuring 'Girls That Dance,' followed by his 2016 EP *Loose Thoughts*. His 2017 one-take YouTube collaboration with French producer FKJ on 'Tadow'—improvised on the spot—exploded with over 70 million views (hundreds of millions later), leading to his 2018 debut album *Lady Lady* with features from FKJ, SiR, Tiffany Gouché, and De' Wayne Jackson. He participated in DJ Jazzy Jeff's mentorship program that year, then moved to Los Angeles, connecting with producer Kojoa Asamoah to craft soulful tracks exploring love and relationships. Later releases include the 2020 EP *Studying Abroad* (extended version Grammy-nominated in 2022 for Best Progressive R&B Album) and his 2023 self-titled album.[1][2][3][4][5]

Masego's legacy lies in his multi-instrumental innovation—saxophone, drums, keys—and energetic live shows, earning global acclaim and a Kennedy Center debut in 2024. His genre-bending sound continues to evolve, with recent setbacks like losing his LA home in early 2025 California fires underscoring his resilience.[3][4][5]
