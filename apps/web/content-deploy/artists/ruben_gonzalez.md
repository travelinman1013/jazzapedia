## Biography
Rubén González Fontanills (May 26, 1919 – December 8, 2003) was a Cuban pianist who helped forge the modern Cuban piano style in the 1940s. Born in Santa Clara, Cuba, González initially pursued medicine and classical piano, intending to balance a medical career with music. However, after beginning his professional career as a full-time musician in 1941, he abandoned his medical studies and became a central figure in Cuban music for over six decades. He started working as a full-time musician during the dawn of a golden era in Cuban music, performing in nightclubs from 9 p.m. until 4 a.m., often playing 25 or 30 numbers a night in response to shouted requests from audiences—a regimen that kept his mind and fingers nimble.

González's career spanned multiple continents and musical contexts. Between the 1940s and his retirement in the 1980s, he played with Cuba's most successful acts, including Arsenio Rodríguez, the legendary blind bandleader who popularized the son style, and Enrique Jorrín, who created the cha-cha-cha. He toured extensively throughout South America with the ensemble Estrellas Negras, traveled to Venezuela where he established himself between 1957 and 1962, and briefly resided in Argentina playing with tango musicians. In 1962, he became the pianist for Enrique Jorrín's orchestra and continued in that role for 25 years. After retiring in the 1980s, González came out of retirement in the 1990s to participate in the revival ensembles Afro-Cuban All Stars and Buena Vista Social Club, recording solo material and performing live until 2002.
