## Biography
Phirpo y sus Caribes was a Venezuelan band specializing in Latin funk, formed as a side project by the renowned musician, arranger, and conductor Porfi Jiménez, whose real name was Porfirio Jiménez Núñez. Born in 1928 in Hato Mayor del Rey, Dominican Republic, Jiménez began his musical career early, developing expertise across genres before leading this group in Venezuela[1][2][3]. The band's sound blended Latin rhythms with funk elements, exemplified in releases like the Latin funk masterpiece featured by Matasuna Records[1].

Active in the Venezuelan music scene, Phirpo y sus Caribes gained recognition through rare 45s and albums such as 'Comencemos (Let's Start)', a Spanish adaptation of Fela Kuti's track from his 1971 live album with Ginger Baker, highlighting their engagement with Afrobeat influences[5][6]. Jiménez's leadership brought a hot, danceable style to tracks like 'Y Esa Pava Que? Pa' Los Rumberos', reissued in later years[3][5]. Their music reflected a fusion of Caribbean roots and Latin American innovations during a vibrant period of regional funk experimentation[4].

Though not widely mainstream, the band's legacy endures through reissues by labels like Matasuna Records, preserving their contributions to Latin funk and underscoring Jiménez's broader influence as a versatile conductor[1][5].
