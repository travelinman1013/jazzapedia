## Biography
Harold Montgomory Budd (May 24, 1936 – December 8, 2020) was an American composer and poet born in Los Angeles and raised in the Mojave Desert town of Victorville after his father's death at age 13 plunged his family into hardship. Exposed to Black culture and jazz in tough Los Angeles neighborhoods, he played drums in bars and jazz clubs as a teenager, influenced by bebop and artists like Chet Baker and Pharoah Sanders. While in the army, he drummed for jazz saxophonist Albert Ayler, then pursued formal studies in music at California State University, Northridge under Gerald Strang and Aurelio de la Vega, and later at the University of Southern California with Ingolf Dahl, graduating in 1966. His early compositional work embraced minimalism and drone music, drawing from John Cage, Morton Feldman, and painter Mark Rothko.[1][4][5]

Budd taught at the California Institute of the Arts, releasing his debut *The Oak of the Golden Dreams* in 1970 using a Buchla synthesizer, but grew disillusioned with avant-garde 'academic pyrotechnics' and briefly quit composing. Encouraged by Brian Eno and Gavin Bryars, he moved to London in the mid-1970s, recording *The Pavilion of Dreams* (1978) for Eno's Obscure Records. He pioneered a 'soft pedal' piano technique—slow, sustained playing with prominent sustain—featured in collaborations like *Ambient 2: The Plateaux of Mirror* (1980) and *The Pearl* (1984) with Eno, shifting toward atmospheric, studio-crafted ambient sounds with synthesizers and electronic textures, though he rejected the ambient label.[1][3][5]

Later works like *Lovely Thunder* (1986) and *The Room* (2000) refined his minimalist, evocative style inspired by nature over urban modernity, influencing ambient's nature-oriented branch. Budd collaborated with Cocteau Twins' Robin Guthrie, Daniel Lanois, John Foxx, and others, while living reclusively in Joshua Tree, California from 2004. His legacy endures as a defiant creator of 'sweet and pretty' music that subverted avant-garde orthodoxy.[1][3][6]

## Fun Facts
- Budd briefly drummed for jazz icon Albert Ayler during army service and produced a 24-hour piece for solo gong called 'Lirio' in the early 1970s.
- He developed his signature 'soft pedal' piano technique in London, deliberately crafting 'sweet and pretty' music to revolt against the avant-garde's 'ugly sounds.'
- A self-described Luddite, Budd never owned a home studio or piano by the mid-1990s, preferring to leave engineering to experts despite synth use.
- Inspired by Pre-Raphaelite painter Dante Gabriel Rossetti alongside Mark Rothko, eschewing 'cool' trends for romantic, melodic ambient.
