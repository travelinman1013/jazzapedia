## Biography
Emmet Cohen, born May 25, 1990, in Miami, Florida, and raised in Montclair, New Jersey, began studying piano at age three using the Suzuki method. He attended Montclair High School, where he participated in The Gibson/Baldwin Grammy Jazz Ensemble, meeting future collaborators, and later earned a Bachelor of Music from the University of Miami's Frost School of Music in 2012 and a Master of Music from the Manhattan School of Music in 2014 on a full merit scholarship. As a young musician, Cohen frequented jazz clubs, learning from artists and playing the Hammond B-3 organ at Cecil's Jazz Club under Cecil Brooks III and saxophonist Bruce Williams.[2][1][6]

Cohen's career took off with his self-released debut album *In the Element* in 2010, followed by wins in the 2011 Phillips Jazz Piano Competition and finalist status in the Thelonious Monk International Piano Competition. He released *Infinity* (2013) and *Questioned Answered* (2014), establishing himself as a bandleader with the Emmet Cohen Trio featuring members like Russell Hall and Joe Farnsworth. His style blends jazz mastery with classical influences, evident in technical precision and stride piano nods, as in his Mack Avenue debut *Future Stride* (2021). Cohen won the 2019 American Pianists Awards Cole Porter Fellowship, gaining a recording contract and residency, and served as Hammond B-3 Organist-in-Residence at Harlem's SMOKE jazz club.[2][1][3][6]

A dedicated educator, Cohen visits 50 schools yearly via Jazz at Lincoln Center's Jazz for Young People and created the Masters Legacy Series to honor jazz pioneers, starting with Jimmy Cobb. During the COVID-19 lockdown, his 'Live From Emmet's Place' livestream garnered millions of views. He has performed globally at festivals like Monterey, Newport, and North Sea, and venues including the Village Vanguard and Kennedy Center, solidifying his legacy as a pivotal jazz figure.[1][2][4][6]
