## Biography
Dave Brubeck (1920-2012) and Louis Armstrong (1901-1971) were two jazz titans whose paths converged in the late 1950s and early 1960s through their landmark collaboration on the jazz musical 'The Real Ambassadors.' Brubeck, a pioneering cool jazz pianist raised in Concord, California, developed his career in the post-World War II era, forming influential quartets and gaining fame with albums like 'Time Out' featuring odd time signatures. Armstrong, the legendary trumpeter and vocalist from New Orleans, had long embodied jazz's spirit through his Hot Five and Hot Seven recordings and his All Stars band, serving as a U.S. State Department 'jazz ambassador' during the Cold War.[1][2][3] Their joint project, conceived by Brubeck and his wife Iola while living in the Oakland hills, addressed civil rights, racial hypocrisy, and America's global image, satirizing how African-American musicians like Armstrong were celebrated abroad but faced segregation at home.[3]

Musically, 'The Real Ambassadors' blended Brubeck's sophisticated compositions and Iola's incisive lyrics with Armstrong's emotive blues singing and improvisational genius, incorporating cool jazz harmonies, vocalese, and protest themes. Recorded in September 1961 for Columbia Records over three sessions, it featured Brubeck's quartet (with Gene Wright and Joe Morello), Armstrong's All Stars (including Trummy Young, Danny Barcelona, Irving Manning, Joe Darensbourg, and Billy Kyle), Lambert, Hendricks & Ross, and Carmen McRae. Premiered live only once at the 1962 Monterey Jazz Festival, the work tackled issues like segregation in 'Little Rock' and divinity in 'They Say I Look Like God,' which Armstrong delivered with profound seriousness, moving audiences to tears.[1][2][7] Though never staged on Broadway as hoped, the album's release highlighted their shared commitment to social justice, with Brubeck notably canceling Southern tours rather than sidelining his Black bassist Eugene Wright.[3]

Their legacy endures as a powerful statement on race and music's role in activism, influencing later jazz works and underscoring the Brubecks' and Armstrong's allyship against segregation. The project marked the first major collaboration between Dave and Iola Brubeck, setting a template for their future endeavors, and remains relevant for its timeless critique of hypocrisy.[2][5][6]

## Fun Facts
- Louis Armstrong practiced the Brubeck material during rare free time on tour and told others they had written him an 'opera,' despite initial producer rejections over its racial message.[1]
- 'Summer Song' from the album was recorded in one take, leaving everyone in the studio crying after Armstrong's performance.[2]
- At the 1962 Monterey Jazz Festival, Lambert, Hendricks & Ross wore sackcloths and hoods (lifted before singing) for 'They Say I Look Like God,' but the performance wasn't filmed due to Brubeck lacking $750.[2]
- Armstrong affirmed his collaborative spirit in a 1962 interview, saying, 'I'll play with anybody, man, you kidding? That's my hustle.'[1]
