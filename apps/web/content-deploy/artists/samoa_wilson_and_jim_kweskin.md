## Biography
Samoa Wilson is a vocalist with a distinctive voice described by the New York Times as "sweet, effortless, old-timey."[5] Raised in the riverbed of traditional North American folk music, she came up in the Boston scene under the mentorship of jug band and folk legend Jim Kweskin, beginning her musical journey at just 12 years old.[5] Wilson has developed a versatile repertoire spanning vintage folk, blues, and jazz standards, bringing honest emotion and sophisticated interpretation to classic material from the 1920s and 1930s.

Jim Kweskin (born July 18, 1940, in Stamford, Connecticut) is an American folk, jazz, and blues musician best known as the founder of the legendary Jim Kweskin Jug Band.[3] During the 1960s folk revival, Kweskin and his jug band—which included Maria Muldaur, Geoff Muldaur, Fritz Richmond, and others—successfully modernized the sounds of pre-World War II rural music, performing at the Newport Folk Festival five years in a row from 1964-1968.[3] Kweskin is recognized for creating one of the bedrock guitar styles of the folk revival, adapting the ragtime-blues fingerpicking of artists like Mississippi John Hurt and Blind Boy Fuller while incorporating sophisticated jazz and blues elements.[2][3]

Since the 21st century, Kweskin and Wilson have maintained a long and productive musical association, collaborating on multiple projects that explore traditional folk, blues, and jazz with a sophisticated sensibility.[2][3] Their partnership exemplifies Kweskin's consistent musical vision of blending traditional folk and blues with the communal simplicity of folk music and the refined approach of jazz.[2] In 2024, Kweskin released *Never Too Late: Duets with My Friends*, and in 2025, he released *Doing Things Right* as part of The Berlin Hall Saturday Night Revue ensemble.[3]
