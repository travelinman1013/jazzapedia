## Biography
Future Islands is a new wave and post-punk band that formed in 2006 in Greenville, North Carolina, when founding members Samuel T. Herring (vocals and lyrics), William Cashion (bass and guitars), and Gerrit Welmers (keyboards and programming) disbanded their previous project, Art Lord & The Self-Portraits, a Kraftwerk-inspired experimental group. The trio relocated to Baltimore, Maryland in late 2007 and early 2008, establishing themselves as a distinctive force in the city's fertile music scene. They released their debut album Wave Like Home in 2008 on Upset the Rhythm, followed by In Evening Air (2010) and On the Water (2011), all recorded in DIY settings that gave their early work a distinctive, intimate character. Herring's theatrical performance style—characterized by chest-beating and intense emotional delivery—became a signature element of their live shows, helping the band build a devoted cult following through relentless touring of small venues.

Future Islands achieved mainstream breakthrough in 2014 with their album Singles, which featured the viral hit "Seasons (Waiting on You)." The song's performance on the Late Show with David Letterman garnered critical acclaim from publications like Pitchfork and NME, transforming the band from underground favorites to widely recognized artists. Drummer Michael Lowry joined the band in 2020, completing the current four-piece lineup. The band has continued releasing albums including The Far Field (2017) and As Long As You Are (2020), with their seventh album People Who Aren't There Anymore representing what critics consider their most emotionally powerful work. Despite being spread across the country when not touring or recording, Future Islands has maintained creative intimacy and longevity that defies their original understanding that the project would be temporary.

Musically, Future Islands combines the romanticism of new wave with the power and drive of post-punk, though the band has consistently rejected the synthpop classification. Their sound is characterized by melodic, romantic synthesizers paired with post-punk bass tones and Herring's distinctive vocal growl. As of 2024, the band marked 18 years of active existence, a milestone that surprised even the members given their initial lack of expectations for longevity. The band's journey from art school friends to legacy act reflects their commitment to artistic integrity and emotional authenticity across nearly two decades of music-making.

## Fun Facts
- The band's name 'Future Islands' was chosen with the understanding that the members would eventually be spread out doing their own things, reflecting an initial expectation that the project would be temporary—an understanding that 'thankfully never solidified' according to Samuel Herring.
- Samuel Herring and William Cashion perform together as The Snails, a live ska band where they dress as snails on stage, representing a playful side project distinct from Future Islands' serious artistic output.
- Future Islands' breakthrough hit 'Seasons (Waiting on You)' went viral following their performance on the Late Show with David Letterman in 2014, transforming the band from a cult favorite with a strong critical following to mainstream recognition.
- The band's early albums were recorded in unconventional spaces including their living room in Baltimore's historic Marble Hill neighborhood, a skate park in Greenville, North Carolina, and a historic waterfront house in Elizabeth City, North Carolina, giving their recordings a distinctive 'ghosts' quality from the spaces themselves.
