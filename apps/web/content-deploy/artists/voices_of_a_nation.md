## Biography
Based on the available search results, 'Voices from the Nations' (not 'Voices of a Nation') is a music and cultural initiative rather than a traditional musical artist or band. Founded by Martin Neil and Rebekah Borden, the project operates as a platform for promoting indigenous cultural music and traditional storytelling from around the world. The initiative focuses on documenting and celebrating musical expressions from diverse tribes and nations, with a particular emphasis on First Nations communities in North America, as well as partnerships with indigenous groups in Tanzania, Cambodia, and other regions globally.
