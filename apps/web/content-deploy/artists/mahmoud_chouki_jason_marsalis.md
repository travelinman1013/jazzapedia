## Biography
Mahmoud Chouki is a Moroccan string virtuoso, innovative composer, and multi-instrumentalist specializing in oud, guitar, and banjo, who moved to New Orleans around 2017 after discovering the city's vibrant jazz scene on Frenchmen Street in 2015. Born in Morocco, he explored traditional instruments and cultures post-high school, creating complex compositions blending North African, Middle Eastern, Spanish, and New Orleans jazz influences. Despite initially not speaking English, he was welcomed by local musicians, leading to widespread collaborations across genres.

Chouki's career in New Orleans flourished through performances at venues like Snug Harbor, commissions such as the 'Oud Concerto for New Orleans' with the New Orleans Chamber Ensemble, and the original soundtrack for the 2021 Sundance Audience Award-winning film 'Ma Belle, Ma Beauty.' He serves as music curator for the New Orleans Museum of Art and released his album *Caravan: From Marrakech to New Orleans* in 2024 on Gallatin Street Records, produced by Jamison Ross, featuring jazz standards and originals with prominent local artists. His style fuses global rhythms into joyful, improvisational 'musical gumbo,' reflecting cultural pluralism.

Jason Marsalis, born March 4, 1977, in New Orleans, is an acclaimed jazz drummer, vibraphonist, composer, and member of the renowned Marsalis family. Starting drums at age 6 under legendary drummer James Black, he debuted on record as a teenager on brother Delfeayo's 1992 album *Pontius Pilate’s Decision*, graduated from NOCCA and Loyola University, and released his debut as leader, *The Year of the Drummer*, at 21. Known for versatility across jazz, funk, fusion, Brazilian, and Celtic music, he has led groups like Los Hombres Calientes and earned awards including Best Drummer (1999) and Best Contemporary Jazz Album (2013).
