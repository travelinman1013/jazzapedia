## Biography
John Birks 'Dizzy' Gillespie was born on October 21, 1917, in Cheraw, South Carolina, the youngest of nine children in a musical family. His father owned a collection of instruments, allowing young Dizzy to experiment with piano at age 4, trombone at 12, and trumpet at 14. He learned to read music from a school roommate and dropped out in 1935 to pursue music in Philadelphia, joining bands like Frank Fairfax's and earning his nickname 'Dizzy.' By 1937, he moved to New York with Teddy Hill's band, replacing Roy Eldridge, and later played with Cab Calloway (1939-1941), where he began composing.[1][2][3][4][5]

In the 1940s, Gillespie co-founded bebop with Charlie Parker, revolutionizing jazz through complex harmonies, rapid improvisation, and virtuosic trumpet playing that built on Eldridge's style. He popularized 'cu-bop' or Afro-Cuban jazz, collaborating with conga drummer Chano Pozo on hits like 'Manteca.' Gillespie led innovative big bands in the late 1940s with arrangements by Tadd Dameron and George Russell, and despite economic challenges, reformed them for State Department tours starting in 1956, earning the title 'jazz ambassador.' He worked with small groups featuring John Coltrane, Milt Jackson, and others into the 1980s, leading the United Nation Orchestra.[1][2][3][4][6]

Gillespie's legacy as a trumpet virtuoso, composer, bandleader, educator, and cultural icon endures through his showmanship, scat singing, and trademark bent-bell trumpet. He influenced global jazz fusion, received numerous awards including a Grammy Lifetime Achievement, and published his memoir *To Be, or Not... to Bop* in 1979. Active until early 1992, he died of pancreatic cancer on January 6, 1993, in Englewood, New Jersey, at age 75.[1][2][3][4][5]
