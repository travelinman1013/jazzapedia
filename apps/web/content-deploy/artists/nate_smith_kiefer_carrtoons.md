## Biography
Ira Nathaniel 'Nate Smith' (born December 14, 1974) is an American drummer, composer, songwriter, and producer from Chesapeake, Virginia. Smith began playing drums at age 11, initially influenced by rock and funk music before developing a deep interest in jazz at 16 after listening to Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers' Album of the Year. While studying media art and design at James Madison University, Smith performed at the Conference of the International Association for Jazz Education in Atlanta, where he met legendary jazz singer Betty Carter, who invited him to perform at New York's Blue Note at age 20. He continued his studies at Virginia Commonwealth University as a member of the Carpenter Fellowship Program, where he met and performed with jazz bassist Dave Holland, eventually joining Holland's GRAMMY-award-winning Quintet and Big Band in 2003.

Smith's professional career began in 2001 as a songwriter and producer, notably contributing to Michael Jackson's 'Heaven Can Wait.' His visceral, instinctive drumming style has established him as a key figure in reinvigorating the international jazz scene. In 2008, Smith began his recording career, first as a solo artist and later with his band KINFOLK. He received two GRAMMY nominations in 2017 for KINFOLK: Postcards from Everywhere for his composition 'Home Free (for Peter Joe)' in the categories of Best Arrangement, Instrumental or A Cappella and Best Instrumental Composition, and another nomination in 2011 as part of the Dave Holland Octet for Best Large Jazz Ensemble Album. Smith has collaborated and toured with renowned artists including Brittany Howard, Pat Metheny, Ravi Coltrane, Van Hunt, Chris Potter, Jose James, Nicholas Payton, and Norah Jones, while also serving as an esteemed educator on the faculty of Betty Carter Jazz Ahead.

Smith's discography as leader includes Workday, Waterbaby Music Vol. 1 (2008), Kinfolk: Postcards from Everywhere (2017), Pocket Change (2018), Light and Shadow (2020), Kinfolk 2: See the Birds (2021), Pocket Change 2: Mad Currency (2023), and Live-Action (2025).
