## Biography
Norosbaldo 'Noro' Morales Sanabia was born on January 4, 1911, in Puerta de Tierra, San Juan, Puerto Rico, into a large musical family. Trained initially on trombone and bass by his father and a sister before mastering piano, Morales took over as conductor of the family orchestra in 1924 after his father's death, following their invitation to serve as the court orchestra for Venezuelan President Juan Vicente Gómez. The family returned to Puerto Rico in 1930, where the band disbanded, leading Noro to freelance with groups like Ralph Sánchez, the Midnight Serenaders, and others before moving to New York City in 1935.[1][2][3][6]

In New York, Morales quickly rose to prominence, forming the Hermanos Morales Orchestra in 1937 with brothers Esy (flute), Humberto (drums), and Pepito (baritone sax), which became Noro Morales and his Orchestra in 1938. Installed as the house band at El Morocco, he became a pioneer of Latin jazz in the early 1940s, blending Puerto Rican flavors with New York big band sensibilities in genres like mambo, rhumba, cha cha cha, and boleros. His hits like 'Serenata Ritmica' and compositions such as 'Bim, Bam, Bum' (covered by Xavier Cugat) and 'Oye Negra' propelled his popularity at venues like the Copacabana and Palladium, earning him nicknames like 'The Latin Duke Ellington' and 'Dean of Latin Jazz.'[1][2][3][4][6]

Health issues from diabetes-induced glaucoma, compounded by alcohol abuse, gambling, and overeating, prompted his return to Puerto Rico in 1960. There, he performed at La Concha Hotel for nearly four years with a new band of local and New York musicians, recording albums for Marvela and Fragoso labels. Morales died on January 14 or 15, 1964, in San Juan, leaving a legacy as a masterful pianist, bandleader, and composer who stayed true to Latin roots amid commercial pressures.[1][2][6]
