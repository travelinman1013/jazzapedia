## Biography
Cory Weeds is a Canadian jazz saxophonist and impresario based in Vancouver, known for his impeccable swing on tenor and alto saxophone. He studied at the University of North Texas and Capilano University, and has been a professional musician for over 25 years, recording more than 20 albums as a leader that showcase his dynamic playing on hard-swinging tunes and gentle ballads. Early in his career, Weeds was a member of the Vancouver band People Playing Music, touring Canada, the US, and Europe, and co-led the instrumental band CRASH with Jerry Cook, releasing albums like *Crash* (1998) and *Candyshop* (1999). In 2003, CRASH backed Hammond B3 organist Dr. Lonnie Smith on *The Dr. Is In*, leading to tours in the Pacific Northwest. Weeds founded and owned the Cellar Jazz Club in Vancouver, where he performed with icons like Joey DeFrancesco and Harold Mabern, and established the Cellar Music Group record label.[1][2][4][6][9]

"Cory Weeds Meets Jerry Weldon" refers to a collaborative project and 2025 album between Weeds and American tenor saxophonist Jerry Weldon, a New York-born veteran of the jazz scene (born September 27, 1957). They have performed together, including in the Cory Weeds Quintet featuring Weldon at events in Squamish, Canada. Weldon graduated from Rutgers University Jazz Program in 1981, joined the Lionel Hampton Orchestra until 2002, and worked with organists like Jack McDuff, Jimmy McGriff, Joey DeFrancesco, and Dr. Lonnie Smith. In 1990, he became a charter member and featured soloist in Harry Connick Jr.'s big band, touring internationally and appearing on Connick's TV show *HARRY* (2016-2018).[1][3][4][5]

Both artists embody soul jazz and hard-swinging tenor traditions, with Weeds embracing diverse situations and Weldon representing bar-walkin', blues-inflected phrasing. Their partnership continues a tenor saxophone battle tradition, as noted in reviews of their joint work.[1][4]
