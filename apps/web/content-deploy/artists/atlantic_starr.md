## Biography
Atlantic Starr is an American R&B band formed in 1976 in Greenburgh, Westchester County, New York, by three brothers: David Lewis (vocals and guitar), Wayne Lewis (keyboards and vocals), and Jonathan Lewis (keyboards and trombone). The original lineup included drummer Porter Carroll Jr., bassist Clifford Archer, percussionist and flautist Joseph Phillips, trumpeter Duke Jones (who left before recordings), guitarist Sheldon Tucker (who also departed early), lead singer Sharon Bryant, trumpeter William Sudderth III, and saxophonist Damon Rentie (later replaced by Koran Daniels). Influenced by 1970s funk and soul acts like Earth, Wind & Fire, the Commodores, New Birth, and L.T.D., the band initially performed as 'Newban' in California before signing with A&M Records in 1977 at the urging of executive Herb Alpert, who prompted the name change to Atlantic Starr to reflect their East Coast roots.[1][2]

The band's self-titled debut album in 1978, produced by Bobby Eli, featured the R&B hit 'Stand Up' and established their funk-soul sound. They achieved greater success with 1981's Radiance, produced by James Carmichael, highlighted by 'When Love Calls' and Sharon Bryant's prominent vocals. After Bryant left in 1984 for a solo career, Barbara Weathers joined, leading to hits like 'Secret Lovers' (1985) and the No. 1 pop/R&B ballad 'Always' from 1987's All in the Name of Love on Warner Bros. The group underwent multiple lineup changes, paring down to a quintet by the late 1980s, with David Lewis departing after 1994's Time. Later releases like 1999's Legacy featured Wayne and Jonathan Lewis with new members.[1][2]

Atlantic Starr's legacy endures in quiet storm and classic soul genres, blending funk, R&B, and ballads. They remained active into the 21st century, performing for fans despite commercial shifts, with a style rooted in 1970s soul that crossed into pop success in the 1980s.[1][2]

## Fun Facts
- The band originally performed as 'Newban' in California nightclubs before changing to Atlantic Starr at A&M Records executive Herb Alpert's request, adding 'Atlantic' for their East Coast origins.[1][2]
- In 1984, five key members—Porter Carroll Jr., Clifford Archer, Damon Rentie, William Sudderth III, and Sharon Bryant—left simultaneously, marking a major turning point.[3]
- Sharon Bryant achieved solo success post-Atlantic Starr, releasing a 1989 album with R&B hits, while saxophonist Damon Rentie issued solo albums from 1985-1987 and did session work with DeBarge.[1]
- Atlantic Starr's debut name idea kept 'Starr' from an early concept, combined with 'Atlantic' to honor their New York roots after signing with A&M.[1][2]
