## Biography
The Rance Allen Group was a pioneering gospel music ensemble formed in 1969 by Bishop Rance Allen and his brothers Thomas (drums) and Steve (bass guitar), with their brother Esau occasionally joining on percussion.[4] Born in Monroe, Michigan in 1948, Rance Allen displayed exceptional musical and spiritual gifts from an early age, beginning his preaching ministry at five years old and developing proficiency on piano and guitar throughout his childhood.[4] The group came to prominence after impressing record promoter Dave Clark at a Detroit talent show in the late 1960s, leading to their signing with Stax Records' newly created Gospel Truth imprint—making them the label's first gospel act.[1][2] Their 1972 self-titled debut album and subsequent appearance at the Wattstax documentary film earned them recognition as "Best Religious Group" by the National Association of Television and Radio Announcers, establishing them as major forces in contemporary gospel music.[3]

The Rance Allen Group revolutionized gospel music by blending traditional gospel with R&B, soul, and funk elements—a contemporary sound that was groundbreaking and sometimes controversial within conservative Black church circles.[6] Throughout the 1970s, they recorded extensively for Stax Records, with Rance serving as the group's primary vocalist, arranger, keyboardist, and guitarist.[1] Following Stax's closure in 1975, the group continued recording independently between 1978 and 1980, releasing albums including "Straight From the Heart," "Smile," and "I Feel Like Going On."[1] Beyond their musical achievements, Rance Allen became an ordained minister and pastor, serving as Pastor of New Bethel Church in Toledo, Ohio since 1985 and later being consecrated as Jurisdictional Prelate of Michigan Northwestern Harvest in 2011.[4] The group's legacy spans over five decades of gospel excellence, influencing subsequent generations of contemporary gospel artists and maintaining their dedication to ministry and spiritual outreach.[4] Bishop Rance Allen passed away on October 31, 2020, from complications due to a medical procedure.[3]
