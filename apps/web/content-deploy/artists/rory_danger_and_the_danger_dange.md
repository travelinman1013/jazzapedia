## Biography
Rory Danger and the Danger Dangers is a New Orleans-based avant-garde rockabilly band led by the multi-talented musician Rory Danger, who was born in Kansas. The band emerged from the New Orleans underground music scene and quickly established itself as a distinctive force in the city's avant-garde rockabilly landscape. With an epic premiere show at Chazfest 2010, followed by a legendary farewell performance and a heroic reunion, the group rapidly dominated the New Orleans avant-garde rockabilly scene and has maintained that prominence since.

The band is recognized as one of the finest concept-driven rock acts to emerge from New Orleans' musical underbelly. Rory Danger serves as the band's saxophonist, singer, and clarinetist, bringing a multi-instrumental approach to the group's sound. The ensemble has achieved notable recognition within the regional music community, including nominations for Best Emerging Artists and Best Album from OffBeat Magazine and the Gambit in 2015, an appearance on HBO's Treme, and a lifetime achievement award at the 2023 French Quarter Festival. Their discography includes the 2014 album 'Age of Exploration' and the 2023 double vinyl release 'Age of Invention,' which showcases the band's eclectic approach by incorporating four distinct musical styles.
