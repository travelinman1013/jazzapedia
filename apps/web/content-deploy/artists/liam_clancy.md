## Biography
Liam Clancy (1935–2009) was born William Clancy on September 2, 1935, in Carrick-on-Suir, County Tipperary, Ireland, the youngest of a musical family. Growing up in a pub-owning household during the War of Independence era, he developed an early passion for performance, acting in local theater like J.M. Synge's 'The Playboy of the Western World' and launching his sister Peg Power's acting career. After brief stints in insurance, he moved to Dublin, learned guitar, and connected with folk song collector Diane Hamilton Guggenheim, leading to his emigration to New York in the mid-1950s.[1][7]

In New York, Clancy joined brothers Paddy and Tom in the Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem, recording for Tradition Records (managed by brother Paddy) with albums like 'The Rising of the Moon' (1956) and 'Come Fill Your Glass With Us.' Their 1961 Ed Sullivan Show appearance in Aran sweaters, extended to 16 minutes, catapulted them to fame, securing a Columbia Records deal and global tours, including the White House for President Kennedy. Known for a repertoire blending rebel songs ('The Patriot Game'), drinking songs ('The Jug of Punch'), and Irish-language pieces, Liam's mellow tenor and guitar work defined their style amid the American folk revival. He left the group in 1973 for solo work.[1][2]

Post-1973, Clancy formed a acclaimed duo with Tommy Makem (1975–1988), scoring a No. 1 Irish hit with 'And the Band Played Waltzing Matilda' (1977), hosted a Canadian TV series winning an Emmy, and later collaborated with family like Robbie O'Connell and son Dónal. His solo career included the 2008 album 'The Wheels of Life' with guests like Tom Paxton and Mary Black. Admired by Bob Dylan for his ballad singing, Clancy published his autobiography 'The Mountain of the Women' (2002) and was honored with a University of Limerick doctorate (2001). He died on December 4, 2009, in Cork, Ireland.[2][5]
