## Biography
The Big 6 Brass Band formed in 2017 in New Orleans' Sixth Ward, starting as a six-member ensemble featuring trumpeter Eric Gordon, trombonist Lamar Heard, tuba player Clifton Smith, snare drummer Pierre Carter, bass drummer Thaddeus Ramsey, and cowbell percussionist Chris Tero. They began playing jam sessions at Josie’s Playhouse, quickly gaining popularity in the second line community with high-energy covers of hit songs like SZA’s “The Weekend,” Michael Jackson, and Fantasia, alongside traditional brass band tunes such as “Red Dress” and “Lilly of the Valley.”[1][2] As demand grew, the band expanded to include additional members like trombonist Dwayne Finnie, trumpeters Chris Cotton and Chadrick Honore, and saxophonist Utopia Francis, evolving beyond its original numerical name to represent a communitarian spirit while all members hail from the Sixth Ward.[1]

Big 6 Brass Band blends brass band traditions with contemporary genres including funk, R&B, hip hop, jazz, and classical, earning them the nickname 'radio band' for their versatile covers but marking a shift with original compositions on their self-titled debut album *Big Six*, released June 24, 2019. Tracks like “The Mind,” “Haters,” “Go Down,” and “On the Run” showcase their confident, party-ready sound reflective of modern New Orleans brass music.[1][2] They maintain strong ties to their roots, frequently performing at Josie’s Playhouse and venues like Tremaine Hideaway and the Jump Off Lounge, even as they play larger festivals.[1][6]

The band's roster draws from experienced musicians, including alumni of prominent New Orleans brass bands, positioning them as vanguard innovators in the scene while honoring its history. Their mixtape circulated widely in the second line community, solidifying their dominance shortly after formation.[2]
