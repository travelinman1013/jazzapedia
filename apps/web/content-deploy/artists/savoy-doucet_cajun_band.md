## Biography
The Savoy-Doucet Cajun Band, formed in 1977, is a trio dedicated to preserving traditional Cajun music, consisting of husband-and-wife Marc and Ann Savoy on accordion and guitar, respectively, and fiddler Michael Doucet of Beausoleil. Marc Savoy, born October 1, 1940, on his grandfather's rice farm near Eunice, Louisiana, began playing traditional music at age 12, inspired by his fiddling grandfather who occasionally played with legendary fiddler Dennis McGee; at 12, he built his own accordion from toilet float rods, and by 25, he established Savoy Music Center in Eunice. Ann Savoy, married to Marc in 1976, contributed her guitar skills and deep knowledge of Cajun music history, authoring a definitive book that earned the Botkin Book Award.[1][2][3][4][5][8]

The band honed a tight, intense sound rooted in authentic Cajun traditions, performing at house parties, Louisiana dance halls, major festivals like Newport Folk and Berlin Jazz, presidential inaugurations, and international venues including Queen Elizabeth Hall in London; they recorded five albums on Arhoolie Records, such as 'Live! At the Dance' (1994) and 'The Best of the Savoy-Doucet Cajun Band' (2002), often demonstrating historical evolutions like early double fiddle-triangle sounds or French ballads from southwest Louisiana. Their performances emphasize earthy sensuality and revival of old tunes without studied pretense, grounding the music in its cultural origins while touring worldwide on State Department tours.[1][2][5][6][7]

Marc received the National Heritage Fellowship, the nation's highest honor for traditional artists, Michael Doucet earned a Grammy, and the group has left a lasting legacy in Cajun music preservation, with members trading instruments onstage and educating audiences on the genre's roots; their work continues to influence Cajun culture through family bands and ongoing performances.[2][3][4]
