## Biography
William Robert 'Billy The Kid' Emerson was born on December 21, 1925, in Tarpon Springs, Pinellas County, Florida, into a musical family with Bahamian roots. He learned piano from his uncle John Hannah and played in local bands in Tampa and St. Petersburg, earning his nickname while dressed as a cowboy outlaw. After serving in the U.S. Navy during World War II, he attended Florida A&M University on an athletic scholarship, joined the Air Force during the Korean War, and met Ike Turner in Greenville, Mississippi, joining his Kings of Rhythm.

Emerson's career peaked in the 1950s with Sun Records, releasing 'No Teasing Around' in 1954 and writing hits like 'Red Hot' (later covered by Billy Lee Riley and Bob Luman) and 'When It Rains It Really Pours' (covered by Elvis Presley). He moved to Vee-Jay and Chess Records, working as a songwriter and A&R for artists including Junior Wells, Buddy Guy, and Howlin’ Wolf, often with Willie Dixon. In 1966, he founded Tarpon Records, launching Denise LaSalle. His style blended slashing blues, infectious R&B, rock & roll, and later gospel, performing on European tours into the 1970s.

In the late 1970s, Emerson rededicated to faith, becoming Rev. William R. Emerson and composing gospel music, though a 1986 near-death experience solidified his born-again commitment. He received the 2017 Florida Folk Heritage Award and was inducted into the Rockabilly Hall of Fame. Emerson passed away on April 25 or 26, 2023, at age 97.
