## Biography
Ruby Rose Blevins, professionally known as Patsy Montana, was born on October 30, 1908, in Hope, Arkansas, as the only girl among eleven siblings. She grew up immersed in church songs, fiddle music, and the recordings of country star Jimmie Rodgers. In 1929, she moved to California to study violin at UCLA, where she won a local talent contest in 1931 by yodeling and performing Jimmie Rodgers songs, earning her initial radio exposure on KMIC as "The Yodeling Cowgirl From San Antone." She adopted the stage name Patsy Montana after performing with cowboy star Monte Montana on a radio show hosted by singer-songwriter Stuart Hamblen.

Montana's breakthrough came in 1933 when she joined the Prairie Ramblers, a successful Kentucky string band, and became a regular performer on WLS Chicago's National Barn Dance, one of the pioneering country-themed broadcasts that predated the Grand Ole Opry. Her signature song, "I Want to Be a Cowboy's Sweetheart," which she composed herself and recorded in 1935, became a historic milestone—it was the first million-selling single by a female country artist. This achievement established her as a groundbreaking figure in country music, demonstrating that women could write their own songs, headline shows independently, and achieve major commercial success in a male-dominated industry.

Montana maintained an active career spanning over seven decades, performing regularly on the National Barn Dance until the 1950s and collaborating with notable artists including Gene Autry, Pat Buttram, Red Foley, and George Gobel. Though rock and roll and folk music challenged her career in the 1960s, she experienced a revival in the 1970s through college campus concerts and renewed interest in country music. She continued performing into late 1995, just before her eighty-seventh birthday, and passed away on May 3, 1996. Later that year, she was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame, cementing her legacy as one of the most important pioneering female country music stars.
