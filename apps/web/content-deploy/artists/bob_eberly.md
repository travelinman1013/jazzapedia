## Biography
Bob Eberly, born Robert Eberle on July 24, 1916, in Mechanicville, New York, and raised in Hoosick Falls, began his career as a guitarist and vocalist in local clubs after winning Fred Allen’s amateur hour in the mid-1930s. Discovered by the Dorsey Brothers in Troy, New York, he joined their orchestra in spring 1935 as a replacement for Bob Crosby, opting to stay with Jimmy Dorsey after the brothers split, where he remained for eight years as a featured romantic baritone vocalist specializing in slow ballads.[1][2][5] His style, described as individual and rivaling Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra, propelled him to high rankings in polls, including third in Billboard’s college polls (1940-1942) and second in Down Beat’s 1941 poll.[1][2]

Eberly's peak fame came from duets with Helen O'Connell, engineered by arranger Tutti Camarata for Dorsey’s radio show, featuring his ballad verse followed by her upbeat chorus on hits like 'Amapola' (1941), 'Tangerine,' 'Green Eyes,' and 'Maria Elena.' He recorded the original 'I'm Glad There Is You' in 1942, a jazz standard, and appeared in films including I Dood It (1943) and The Fabulous Dorseys (1947).[1][4] Entering military service in December 1943, he sang with Wayne King’s orchestra in Chicago until 1945, after which solo efforts on Decca, Coral, and Riviera labels failed to recapture his stardom amid the big band era's decline.[2][4]

Post-war, Eberly toured solo, co-hosted TV shows with O'Connell, and performed in small clubs into the 1970s, with his final gig at Disney World's Top of the World in 1980. He died on November 17, 1981, in Glen Burnie, Maryland, from cancer complications after lung surgery funded by Frank Sinatra, leaving a legacy as a swing-era crooner whose warm baritone defined Jimmy Dorsey's sound.[1][2][5]

## Fun Facts

- Was best friends and roommates with Jimmy Dorsey, who encouraged him to go solo, but he preferred the security of a steady band salary.[1]
- Frank Sinatra, whom he rivaled in polls, paid for his 1980 lung cancer surgery despite never meeting.[1][5]
- His younger brother Ray Eberle was a vocalist with Glenn Miller, and they grew up together in Hoosick Falls, New York.[2][3]
