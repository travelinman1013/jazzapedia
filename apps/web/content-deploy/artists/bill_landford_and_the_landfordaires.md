## Biography
Bill Landford was a pioneering gospel singer known for his tenor falsetto, blues-weary vibrato, and spare guitar accompaniment. Prior to forming his own group, he was a member of influential ensembles including the Golden Gate Quartet, Southern Sons, and Selah Jubilee Singers, where he honed his skills in gospel and spirituals.[1][3][5] In 1945, Landford established Bill Landford & The Landfordaires, blending traditional gospel with spirituals in folk, country, and word genres, characterized by distinctive guitar intros and rich a cappella harmonies.[1][5]

The group signed with Columbia Records, releasing both traditional pieces and original compositions by Landford, such as 'Run On for a Long Time' (1949) and 'I'm Troubled Lord, I'm Troubled.'[1][2] Their music appeared on numerous compilations, preserving their signature style that emphasized heartfelt harmonies and spiritual depth.[1] Landford's recordings, particularly of the traditional hymn 'God's Gonna Cut You Down' (as 'Run On for a Long Time'), influenced later artists across genres.[2][3]

Though specific details on Landford's later career and death are scarce in available sources, the Landfordaires' contributions to postwar gospel resurgence endure through reissues and covers by artists like Johnny Cash and Moby, cementing their legacy in American roots music.[2][3][5]
