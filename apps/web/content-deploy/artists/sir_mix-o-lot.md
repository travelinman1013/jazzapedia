## Biography
Anthony L. Ray, known professionally as Sir Mix-a-Lot, was born on August 12, 1963, in Seattle, Washington. Growing up in a city not yet known for hip-hop, he developed an early passion for music and electronics, influenced by the rise of hip-hop in the early 1980s. After high school, he began DJing parties at local community centers like the Rainier Vista Boys and Girls Club in South Seattle and later the Rotary Boys and Girls Club in the Central District. There, he met local DJ 'Nasty' Nes Rodriguez, leading to the co-founding of Nastymix Records in 1983 with businessman Ed Locke. His breakthrough came with 'Square Dance Rap' in 1986, followed by 'Posse on Broadway' in 1987, which referenced Seattle landmarks and peaked in the Top 100. His debut album *Swass* (1988) went platinum, featuring a hip-hop cover of Black Sabbath's 'Iron Man' with Metal Church.[1][2][3]

Sir Mix-a-Lot's career peaked with the 1992 album *Mack Daddy* on Def American, propelled by the massive hit 'Baby Got Back,' which topped the Billboard Hot 100 for five weeks, earned double platinum status, and won a 1993 Grammy for Best Rap Solo Performance. The song's playful celebration of curvier women sparked controversy, with MTV restricting its video to after 9 PM. He followed with *Chief Boot Knocka* (1994), featuring 'Put 'Em On The Glass,' and a Grammy-nominated track. His style blended old school hip-hop with humor, West Coast flair, and innovative production techniques like speeding up vocals for a 'Smurf voice' effect. Collaborations included grunge band Mudhoney on 'Freak Momma' for the *Judgment Night* soundtrack (1993).[1][2][3][4]

In later decades, Sir Mix-a-Lot released *Daddy's Home* (2003), hosted a Seattle radio show (2017-2019), and continued performing while promoting local talent. His legacy as a Seattle hip-hop pioneer endures, with 'Baby Got Back' remaining a cultural staple, alongside his entrepreneurial ventures and influence on the genre's mainstream breakthrough from the Pacific Northwest.[1][2][3]
