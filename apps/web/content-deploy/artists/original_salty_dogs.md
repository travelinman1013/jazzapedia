## Biography
The Original Salty Dogs Jazz Band formed in 1947 at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, when a group of students created a jazz club that evolved into the Purdue Jazz Society. Initially performing as 'The Original Peerless Jazz Band' on campus and 'The Salty Dogs' at local taverns, the ensemble quickly gained traction playing traditional jazz influenced by 1910s-1920s Dixieland artists and 1940s-1950s revivalists like Lu Watters and Turk Murphy. As members graduated, some relocated to Chicago, establishing a professional offshoot while the campus band continued with new students, leading to the Chicago group adopting 'The Original Salty Dogs Jazz Band' name by the late 1950s to avoid confusion.[1][2]

Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the band solidified its lineup and reputation, performing at Chicago venues like the Hunt Club, Sabre Room, Blue Note, and Red Arrow, while driving from Purdue for weekend gigs. They released limited-edition campus recordings in the late 1950s, their first widely distributed album in 1963 on Audiophile Records, and a commercial debut in 1964 on Delmark Records, followed by albums on GHB, Jazz & Jazz, OKOM, Xylophonia, and Stomp Off labels. Festival appearances began in 1969 at the St. Louis Ragtime and Traditional Jazz Festival on the Goldenrod Showboat, becoming a staple event, and they occasionally shared stages with acts like The Kingston Trio and George Shearing.[1][2][4]

Despite lineup changes in the 1970s, including vocalist Carol Leigh joining in 1973 inspired by the Turk Murphy style, the band persisted with core members from the 1950s-1960s, offering occasional performances into the 2020s. Their enduring midwestern presence preserved traditional jazz amid shifting musical tastes.[1][2][5]
