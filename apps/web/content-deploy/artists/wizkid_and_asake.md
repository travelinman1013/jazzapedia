## Biography
Wizkid (Ayodeji Ibrahim Balogun, born July 16, 1990, in Surulere, Lagos, Nigeria) and Asake (Ahmed Ololade, born January 13, 1995) are two leading Nigerian artists pivotal to the global rise of Afrobeats. Wizkid began his career in the late 2000s, releasing his breakthrough single 'Holla at Your Boy' in 2010, which earned him the Next Rated Award at The Headies in 2011. His debut album *Superstar* (2011) featured hits like 'Don't Dull,' followed by *Ayo* (2014). Global fame arrived with the 2016 Drake collaboration 'One Dance,' topping the Billboard Hot 100. Albums like *Made in Lagos* (2020), with the Grammy-nominated 'Essence' ft. Tems, solidified his legacy as Africa's biggest music export, blending Afrobeats, reggae, R&B, and hip-hop.[4][5] Asake, who studied Theatre and Dramatic Arts at Obafemi Awolowo University, started as a dancer and drummer, entering music professionally around 2015. Influenced by Fuji, hip-hop, and Afrobeats, he gained traction with 2020's 'Lady' and exploded in 2022 via YBNL Nation, releasing EP *Ololade* and debut album *Mr. Money with the Vibe*, debuting at #66 on Billboard 200 with hits like 'Sungba' (Burna Boy remix) and 'Terminator'.[1][3]

Their careers intersected notably with the 2023 track 'MMS,' which broke Spotify Nigeria's first-day streaming record. Asake's rapid ascent continued with albums *Work of Art* (2023) and *Lungu Boy* (2024), both topping Nigerian charts, plus sold-out shows like Barclays Center (2023), the first by an African artist. He left YBNL in 2025 to launch Giran Republic with 'Why Love.' Wizkid founded Starboy Entertainment post-EME, headlining arenas and influencing fashion. Both artists' styles—Wizkid's melodic fusion and Asake's vibrant Fuji-Afrobeats—have driven Afrobeats' mainstream dominance, earning Wizkid a Grammy for 'Brown Skin Girl' and Asake nominations for BET, Grammys, and more.[1][2][4]

Their legacy includes pioneering African music globally: Wizkid as the first Nigerian on major international charts, Asake as a chart-topping force with historic milestones. Genres like Afrobeats, Afropop, and Afrofusion define their Spotify profile (popularity 84), inspiring a new generation amid ongoing evolutions like Asake's independence.[1][2][5]
