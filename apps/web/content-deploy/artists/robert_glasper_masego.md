## Biography
Robert Andre Glasper, born April 5, 1978, in Houston, Texas, grew up immersed in music through his mother, Kim Yvette, a professional blues singer, and church performances where he played organ. He attended the High School for the Performing and Visual Arts (HSPVA), graduating in 1997, which honed his piano skills and laid the foundation for his genre-blending style fusing jazz, hip-hop, R&B, neo-soul, and blues.[1][2][4][5] His early albums like 'Mood' (2002) and 'In My Element' (2007) showcased his acoustic jazz trio, while 'Double-Booked' (2009) introduced The Robert Glasper Experiment, an electric band experimenting with hip-hop and R&B elements, earning a Grammy nomination.[1][4][7]

Glasper's breakthrough came with 'Black Radio' (2012), featuring neo-soul and hip-hop artists like Erykah Badu, Bilal, Lupe Fiasco, Lalah Hathaway, and Yasiin Bey; it debuted in the top 10 across four Billboard charts and won the Grammy for Best R&B Album, redefining genre boundaries with live recordings and no overdubs.[2][4][6][7] Follow-ups like 'Black Radio 2' (2013) earned another Grammy for Best Traditional R&B Performance on 'Jesus Children of America,' and he contributed to Kendrick Lamar's 'To Pimp a Butterfly' (2015) and composed for the Miles Davis biopic 'Miles Ahead.'[1][3][4] In 2018, he formed R+R=NOW and August Greene, continuing his collaborative fusion approach.[1][2]

Glasper's legacy includes 4 Grammy Awards (with 12 nominations total across genres), an Emmy, and pioneering hyper-collaborative projects that bridge jazz with contemporary Black music, influencing a new paradigm of boundaryless creativity. He hosts the Blue Note Cruise and curates sold-out residencies blending diverse artists.[1][2][4][6]
