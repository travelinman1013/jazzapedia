## Biography
Crystal Winds was a short-lived American soul-funk band formed in the late 1970s by key figures Paul Coleman (keyboardist) and M.C. (Morris) Brown (saxophonist), both alumni of the mid-1970s band Rasputin Stash, which released two albums on Cotillion (Atlantic subsidiary) and Chicago indie Gemigo.[2] The group debuted with their sole album *First Flight* around 1979-1980, featuring Coleman and Brown writing most tracks, handling male lead vocals, and arranging strings, with Brown also writing horn arrangements.[2] Female vocals were provided by Theresa Davis, and the project involved legendary conductor Rich Tufo (associated with Curtis Mayfield and Curtom acts like Linda Clifford) for strings and horns.[2] Other contributors included guitarist Martin Dumas (co-writer on 'Lover’s Holiday' and ex-Rasputin Stash member) and drummer E. Frank Donaldson (on two tracks, also ex-Rasputin Stash).[2]

The band's musical style blended soul, funk, and jazz elements, highlighted by tracks like 'Signs of Winter's Time,' later reissued by Athens of the North on AOTNLP050.[2][4] Despite limited commercial success—reflected in current Spotify popularity of 10—*First Flight* has garnered cult interest among collectors for its rich arrangements and ties to Chicago's funk scene.[2] No extensive career development or later albums are documented, suggesting Crystal Winds disbanded after this release, leaving a modest legacy in obscure soul reissue circles.[2][3]
