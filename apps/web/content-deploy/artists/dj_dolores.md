## Biography
Helder Aragão, better known as DJ Dolores, is a Brazilian DJ, designer, and musician from Sergipe. He gained early recognition as a participant in the mangue movement in Recife, Brazil, where he contributed as a designer, notably creating the iconic 'crabs with brains' artwork for the movement's first release.[1][4] Transitioning into music in the late 1990s, he immersed himself in electronic music, adopting the DJ Dolores moniker and sampling sounds from the streets of Recife to produce innovative tracks blending electronic grooves with regional northeastern Brazilian rhythms.[1][2]

DJ Dolores formed the Orchestra Santa Massa, a collective that fused electronic beats with traditional manguebeat and regional sounds, achieving national and international acclaim.[1] His solo discography includes albums like *Aparelhagem* (2005) and *1 Real* (2008), while he has also composed scores for films such as *O Rap do Pequeno Príncipe Contra as Almas Sebosas* (2000), *Narradores de Javé* (2003), *Neighboring Sounds* (2012), and *Tatuagem* (2013).[1] His work exemplifies the manguebeat scene's experimental spirit, merging urban electronic production with Brazil's cultural heritage.[2][4]

DJ Dolores remains a key figure in Brazil's electronic and world music landscape, with his Recife-rooted sound influencing the global perception of Brazilian electronica. Active in the local scene since 1989, his legacy endures through his contributions to music, design, and film scoring.[1][2]
