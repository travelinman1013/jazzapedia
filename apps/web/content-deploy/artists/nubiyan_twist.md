## Biography
Nubiyan Twist is a Leeds-born, London-based musical collective founded around 2011 at Leeds College of Music by guitarist, producer, and bandleader Tom Excell. Emerging from the college's jazz courses and production studios, the group began as a collaborative project blending Afrobeat influences with contemporary jazz, hip-hop, electronic music, reggae, dub, and UK sound-system culture, inspired by Excell's childhood exposure to his father's jazz collection, classical guitar studies, and local Caribbean community vibes. The ensemble, often described as a nonet or larger group with a rotating cast, features virtuosic players including a powerful horn section, soulful vocals by Nubiya Brandon, live dubs/electronics, turntablism, and an explosive rhythm section drawing from Brazil to the UK.[1][2][3][8]

The band developed organically through frequent jams among friends at Leeds College, woodshedding their process before self-producing early tracks co-written by Excell and keyboardist Joe Henwood, later recruiting drummer Finn Booth and percussionist Pilo Adami. Their debut album garnered strong support from jazz, world, and hip-hop press including Huey Morgan, David Rodigan, and Craig Charles, followed by releases like Siren Song (2016), Freedom Fables (2021) on Strut Records—a vocal-oriented exploration of narratives and personal stories—and later albums such as Find Your Flame (featuring vocalist Aziza Jaye) and Jungle Run (with guests like Tony Allen and Mulatu Astatke). Known for their eclectic, groove-driven sound that's cinematic and multi-genre, they've performed globally, selling out London's Jazz Cafe, appearing at Glastonbury, Boomtown, Edinburgh Jazz Festival, and David Byrne's Meltdown at Queen Elizabeth Hall.[1][2][4][5][6]

Over nearly 15 years, Nubiyan Twist has evolved into a powerhouse emphasizing collective identity amid industry pressures for solo branding, balancing individual solos with group dynamics rooted in jazz improvisation. Their music reflects personal catharsis—navigating COVID, parenthood, health challenges like a leg amputation, and loss—while fostering unity through diverse global influences from highlife and Ethiojazz to soul and electronica, solidifying their legacy as genre-defying innovators in the UK jazz scene.[2][3][4][7]
