## Biography
Rodrigo Campos is a Brazilian composer and instrumentalist who emerged from the vibrant samba circles of São Mateus, a neighborhood in São Paulo, where he began his artistic journey playing cavaquinho and percussion. His debut solo album, "São Mateus não é um lugar assim tão longe" (2009), established him as a significant voice in contemporary Brazilian music, earning widespread critical acclaim and recognition as one of the year's best releases. His second album, "Bahia Fantástica" (2012), further solidified his reputation, garnering national and international accolades including the Best New Artist award at the Brazilian Music Awards in 2013.

Campos became a central figure in the "samba sujo" (dirty samba) movement and a core member of Clube da Encruza, a dynamic musical collective that emerged from São Paulo in the early 2010s. This collective represented one of the most innovative moments in Brazilian music, bringing together musicians who blended traditional samba with contemporary experimental approaches. His work on "Bahia Fantástica" featured collaborations with fellow Clube members and artists including Luísa Maita and Criolo, showcasing his ability to craft intricate compositions that capture intimate moments in unexpected places. Campos' musical style is characterized by rich detail, sophisticated arrangements, and a blend of New MPB (Música Popular Brasileira), samba, and funk influences.
