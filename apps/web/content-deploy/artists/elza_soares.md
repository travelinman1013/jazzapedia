## Biography
Elza Soares, born Elza da Conceição Gomes on June 23, 1930, in the Moça Bonita favela of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, grew up in extreme poverty as the daughter of a factory worker and a washerwoman. At age 13, in 1950, she won a radio singing contest on Rádio Tupi by performing 'Lá Vai Samba,' adapting it with scat singing inspired by Louis Armstrong—though she later claimed ignorance of American music at the time—launching her career despite her impoverished background and oversized high heels that amused the host.[1][2][6] After her first husband's death from tuberculosis, she left her children with her mother and toured Argentina for eight months in 1958 with Mercedes Batista, then returned to Rio and São Paulo, gaining fame with hits like 'Se Acaso Você Chegasse' (1959) and building her signature husky, gravelly voice in samba, sambalanço, bossa nova, and MPB.[1][3][5]

Soares rose to national prominence in the 1960s, recording hits such as 'Boato' (1961), 'Cadeira Vazia' (1961), 'Só Danço Samba' (1963), and 'Mulata Assanhada' (1965), while blending samba with jazz and soul elements; she represented Brazil at the 1962 FIFA World Cup in Chile, meeting Louis Armstrong, and released albums like the 'Elza, Miltinho e Samba' series (1967-1969).[1][4][5] Facing adversity during the military dictatorship, economic struggles, and personal hardships—including a violent marriage to soccer player Garrincha—she persisted, moving briefly to Italy in 1969 before returning. Her later career saw innovative comebacks, such as 'Do Cóccix Até o Pescoço' (2002) mixing samba with funk, rap, and tango, and 'A Mulher do Fim do Mundo' (2016), incorporating hip-hop and electronic music with avant-garde collaborators.[1][4][6]

Named Singer of the Millennium by BBC Radio in 1999 alongside Tina Turner, Soares was a symbol of resilience, women's rights, and Afro-Brazilian culture, performing at events like the 2007 Pan American Games and 2016 Rio Olympics opening until her death on January 20, 2022, at age 91 in Rio de Janeiro.[1][2][6]
