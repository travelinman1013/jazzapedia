## Biography
Jimmy Smith, born James Oscar Smith on December 8, 1925, in Norristown, Pennsylvania, grew up immersed in music, playing piano from age nine and drums in his high school band. After serving in the Navy during World War II, he studied at the Ornette Coleman School of Music and Philadelphia Musical Academy, transitioning to the Hammond B3 organ in 1951 after witnessing Wild Bill Davis perform. This innovation defined his career, as he pioneered its use in jazz, blending bebop phrasing with blues and funk grooves, creating the soul jazz genre. Smith debuted in New York in 1956, signing with Blue Note Records and releasing seminal albums like *A New Sound A New Star* and *The Sermon!*, establishing him as the first jazz organ superstar through collaborations with Kenny Burrell, Lou Donaldson, and others.

Smith's career peaked in the 1960s with Verve Records, producing hits like *Bashin'* with Oliver Nelson's big band and duo albums with Wes Montgomery. He toured extensively, performed at Newport Jazz Festival, and appeared in films, though he took a hiatus in the 1970s to run a failed supper club. Revived in the 1980s-1990s, he recorded for Blue Note, Elektra, and Verve, contributing to Michael Jackson's *Bad* (1987) and Frank Sinatra's *L.A. Is My Lady* (1984) via Quincy Jones. His final album, *Dot Com Blues* (2000), featured Etta James, Dr. John, and B.B. King, incorporating blues and soul. Smith died on February 8, 2005, in Scottsdale, Arizona, honored as a NEA Jazz Master that year, leaving a legacy as the Hammond B3 master whose style influenced hip-hop sampling by Beastie Boys and others.

The Spotify reference 'Jimmy Smith w/Etta James & Dr. John' highlights their collaboration on *Dot Com Blues*, a late-career soul jazz-blues fusion reflecting Smith's genre-spanning evolution from hard bop to funk.
