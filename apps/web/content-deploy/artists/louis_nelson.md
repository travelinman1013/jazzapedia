## Biography
Louis Hall Nelson (September 17, 1902 – April 5, 1990) was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, into a highly educated family; his mother, Anna Hattie Adams Nelson, was a gifted pianist. Raised partly by family friend Reverend Isaac H. Hall, he attended Lutheran School and New Orleans University, graduating in 1919. Inspired by trombonist Lawrence Johnson’s smooth tone, Nelson began his career with Joe Gabriel’s band in Thibodaux around 1920, playing rural dance halls, and soon joined Kid Rena’s band. Throughout the 1920s, he performed with New Orleans jazz luminaries like Buddy Petit, Kid Punch Miller, Sam Morgan, Chris Kelly, Papa Celestin, Kid Howard, and the Kid Harris Dixieland Band, while supplementing income with driving and chauffeuring jobs.[1][2]

During the Great Depression, Nelson played in a Works Progress Administration band under Pinchback Touro and Louis Dumaine, and later with the Original Tuxedo Orchestra in 1936. He served in the U.S. Navy during World War II as Musician First Class in Memphis, Tennessee. Post-war, he joined Sidney Desvigne’s Orchestra until it relocated, then aligned with Kid Thomas Valentine’s band in 1945, playing West Bank venues. His career revived in the late 1950s through Preservation Hall, founded from Larry Borenstein’s gallery sessions; Nelson became a charter member of the Preservation Hall Jazz Band, recording extensively with Kid Thomas (Bill Russell, 1949), Percy Humphrey (Riverside), and on Atlantic’s Jazz at Preservation Hall series. Known for his mellow tone and harmony playing in traditional New Orleans jazz and brass bands like Young Tuxedo, Eureka, George Williams, and Kid Howard, he toured globally from 1963 with George Lewis to Japan, Europe, South America, Australia, Canada, Mexico, and U.S. festivals.[1][2][3]

In 1981, Nelson received a National Endowment for the Arts grant to teach jazz history to New Orleans public school students. Until his death at 87, he performed regularly at Preservation Hall, led the Louis Nelson All-Stars, and appeared at every New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, cementing his legacy as a traditional jazz trombonist who bridged early 20th-century New Orleans sounds to international audiences.[1][2]
