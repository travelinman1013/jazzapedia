## Biography
Explosions in the Sky is an American post-rock band formed in Austin, Texas, in 1999 by guitarists Michael James, Munaf Rayani, and Mark Smith from Midland, Texas, and drummer Chris Hrasky from Rockford, Illinois. Originally named Breaker Morant, the group changed its name after Hrasky remarked on fireworks exploding in the sky following their first performance at KVRX radio, where they recorded their debut track 'Remember Me as a Time of Day.' They quickly gained local acclaim for their live shows and were signed to Temporary Residence Limited after The American Analog Set submitted a demo tape with a note praising its intensity, leading to a enduring partnership now spanning over 20 years.[1][2][4]

The band's career developed through a series of dynamic, instrumental albums characterized by elaborate guitar work, emotional crescendos, and narrative structures, starting with How Strange, Innocence (2000) and Those Who Tell the Truth Shall Die, Those Who Tell the Truth Shall Live Forever (2001), the latter sparking media attention due to its release timing before 9/11 and provocative liner notes featuring an airplane image. Their style draws from instrumental post-rock influences, emphasizing cathartic, emotive sound without vocals, which has supported tours with acts like Nine Inch Nails and Fugazi, soundtrack work, and licensing for films, TV, commercials, and games. Albums like The Earth Is Not a Cold Dead Place (2003), All of a Sudden I Miss Everyone (2007), Take Care, Take Care, Take Care (2011), The Wilderness (2016), and End (2023) showcase their evolution toward more experimental and restrained elements, with releases sometimes delayed by extensive touring and external events like the COVID-19 pandemic.[1][2][3]

Over 25 years, Explosions in the Sky has built a loyal following beyond post-rock, popularizing the genre's emotional dimension through their quiet-loud-quiet dynamics while rejecting larger labels to maintain creative control. Their unanimous decision-making process among the four members ensures collective ownership, though it slows output, as seen in the seven-year gap before End, which they clarified was not a farewell despite its title.[1][3]
