## Biography
Steven Oquendo is a Puerto Rican and Dominican-descended trumpeter, bandleader, and music educator born in 1979 in New York City. His musical journey began at age 10 when he first learned trumpet, leading him to attend the prestigious Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School, where he was a member of the award-winning LaGuardia Concert Jazz Ensemble. During his high school years, Oquendo earned the Outstanding Soloist Award in 1998 from Wynton Marsalis at the Jazz at Lincoln Center's Essentially Ellington Competition and was selected for the Grammy All-American High School Jazz Orchestra. He was mentored by two of jazz's most respected trumpeters, Jon Faddis and Wynton Marsalis, establishing himself early as a powerful force in the Latin music scene.

Oquendo's professional career has been marked by extensive touring across Africa, Europe, South America, and the Caribbean, with collaborations spanning diverse genres and artists including Celia Cruz, Rubén Blades, Eddie Palmieri, Juan Luis Guerra, Destiny's Child, and Big Pun. In 2009, while working as a music instructor at Harlem School of the Arts, Oquendo founded the Steven Oquendo Latin Jazz Orchestra (SOLJO), a 19-piece big band that has become a cornerstone of New York's Latin jazz scene. SOLJO has performed at prestigious venues including Jazz at Lincoln Center's Dizzy's Club and has earned recognition for its sophisticated arrangements of Afro-Cuban, salsa, and mambo classics. Beyond his work as a bandleader, Oquendo serves as music director for Pelham Preparatory Academy in the Bronx and assistant director of the All-City Latin Ensemble, earning recognition from Good Morning America as a 2022 Class Act teacher for his educational impact.
