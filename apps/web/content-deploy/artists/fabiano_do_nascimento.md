## Biography
Fabiano do Nascimento was born in Rio de Janeiro in 1983 into a deeply musical family, with his great-grandfather Ladário Teixeira being a blind virtuoso saxophonist who contributed to the development of the saxophone itself.[1][3] Initially trained in classical piano and music theory as a child, Fabiano's passion shifted to the guitar at age ten, which he pursued with intense devotion under the mentorship of his late uncle Lúcio Nascimento, a revered bassist, composer, and arranger.[1][3] He studied at the Conservatório de Música Brasileira in Rio de Janeiro and became largely self-taught through extensive research and practice, developing exceptional technical skill while remaining deeply rooted in Brazilian musical traditions.[3]

In 2001, Fabiano relocated to Los Angeles, where his distinctive artistry quickly gained recognition.[1][5] He first made waves as a founding member of the critically acclaimed Latin jazz group Triorganico alongside woodwind player Pablo Calogero and percussionist Tiki Pasillas, recording their debut album "Triorganico – Convivencia" under Stonesthrow and Now-Again Records.[3][5] Since then, he has established a prolific solo career spanning nine full-length albums released on prestigious labels including Now-Again Records, Far Out Recordings, Leaving Records, and Real World Records.[1] His music synthesizes the deep traditions of Brazilian jazz—particularly Afro-samba and choro—with adventurous, genre-fluid elements including American jazz, experimental electronica, and orchestral arrangements.[1][2]

Fabiano is recognized as a singular voice in contemporary music, performing on various multi-string guitars (6, 7, 8, and 10-string nylon instruments) and creating what has been termed "retro-futuristic Brazilian music."[2][4] His work has been celebrated by major media outlets, including an NPR Tiny Desk Concert feature.[1] As a seasoned live performer, he has toured extensively across North America and Asia, with a successful European debut tour in 2024 that included sold-out shows and a standout performance at London's ICA.[1] He is currently based in Los Angeles and Tokyo.[1][4]
