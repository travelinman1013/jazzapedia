## Biography
Mulatu Astatke (born 19 December 1943) is an Ethiopian musician, composer, and arranger widely regarded as the father of Ethio-jazz. Born in Jimma, Ethiopia, he received formal musical training at Lindisfarne College and Trinity College of Music in England, and later at Berklee College of Music in Boston, where he became the first African student at the institution. During his time in the United States in the 1960s, Astatke absorbed diverse musical influences including jazz, Latin music, and funk, which he synthesized with traditional Ethiopian musical elements to create Ethio-jazz—a revolutionary genre that fuses Ethiopian traditional music with American jazz, Latin rhythms, and African popular styles.

In the early 1970s, Astatke brought his innovative sound back to Ethiopia, where he introduced the vibraphone and conga drums to Ethiopian popular music, instruments that became central to his artistic identity. He recorded landmark albums including Mulatu of Ethiopia (1972) and Yekatit Ethio Jazz (1974), most released through Amha Records in Addis Ababa. His work appeared on all three known instrumental albums released during Ethiopia's Golden Age of Music in the 1970s, and he collaborated with prominent Ethiopian artists including Mahmoud Ahmed. In 1973, he performed as a special guest with Duke Ellington's orchestra during its Ethiopian tour. Following the closure of Amha Records in 1975 under the Derg regime, many of his recordings fell into obscurity until the 1990s, when international collectors and audiences began rediscovering his work.

Astatke's career has spanned over six decades of continuous innovation and global influence. In the 2000s, he expanded his international collaborations, performing with the Either/Orchestra, recording with The Heliocentrics, and serving as an Abramowitz Artist-in-Residence at MIT and a fellow at Harvard University's Radcliffe Institute, where he focused on developing modern Ethiopian instruments. In 2024, he collaborated with Tel Aviv's Hoodna Orchestra on the album Tension, and in 2025, he released Mulatu Plays Mulatu through Strut Records—his first major studio release in over a decade, featuring new arrangements of classic compositions recorded in London and Addis Ababa with traditional Ethiopian instruments. In 2025, Astatke announced his retirement from touring, concluding a transformative career that fundamentally shaped the international perception of Ethiopian music and its integration with modern jazz traditions.
