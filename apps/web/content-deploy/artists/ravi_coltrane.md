## Biography
Ravi Coltrane, born August 6, 1965, on Long Island, New York, is the second son of legendary jazz saxophonist John Coltrane and pianist Alice Coltrane, named after Indian sitarist Ravi Shankar. After his father's death in 1967, the family relocated to Los Angeles, where a young Ravi, initially shy and interested in photography and film, began on clarinet before switching to saxophone in high school. He graduated from El Camino Real High School in Woodland Hills in 1983 and studied saxophone at the California Institute of the Arts starting in 1986, marking the beginning of his serious musical pursuit.[1][2][3][4]

Coltrane's career gained momentum in the early 1990s after moving to Queens, New York, where he apprenticed with masters like Elvin Jones, Jack DeJohnette, Wallace Roney, Joanne Brackeen, and especially Steve Coleman, whose M-Base approach profoundly shaped his rhythmic and harmonic sensibilities beyond traditional bebop or his father's modal style. His debut as a leader, *Moving Pictures* (1998), featured collaborators like Jeff 'Tain' Watts, Lonnie Plaxico, and Michael Cain, earning acclaim and leading to tours with his band including Andy Milne and Steve Hass. Subsequent releases like *From the Round Box* (2000) with Geri Allen, *Mad 6* (2002), *In Flux* (2005), *Blending Times* (2009), and *Spirit Fiction* (2012) showcased his evolution as a composer and improviser. He joined the Blue Note 7 in 2008 for their anniversary album *Mosaic* and co-owns RKM Music, producing artists like Luis Perdomo and Ralph Alessi.[1][3][5]

Known for his post-bop and free jazz style blending influences from mentors while forging a personal voice—thoughtful, ego-free, and innovative—Coltrane has performed with icons like McCoy Tyner, Pharoah Sanders, Herbie Hancock, Chick Corea, and Branford Marsalis. Grammy-nominated, he continues as a bandleader exploring his heritage without being defined by it, emphasizing creative exploration in modern jazz.[1][2][6][7]
