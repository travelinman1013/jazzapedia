## Biography
The Dur-Dur Band, meaning 'spring' in Somali, was formed in 1980s Mogadishu by bassist Abdillahi Ujeeri and keyboardist Eise Dahir Qasim (also known as Isse Dahir Qassim or Abukar Dahir Qasim), aiming to assemble the city's top talent at the Juba Hotel. Emerging during a vibrant era of cultural experimentation post-independence and socialist reforms, the band fused traditional Somali dhaanto rhythms with psychedelic rock guitars, Bollywood-inspired melodies, funk, disco, soul, and influences from Michael Jackson, Bob Marley, Santana, and Bollywood music, quickly surpassing rivals like Iftin Band by recruiting their singer Sitey Xosul Wanaag and dominating Mogadishu's disco scene with bootleg live recordings.[1][2][3]

Lead vocalists including Sahra Abukar Dawo, Abdinur Adan Daljir, Mohamed Ahmed Qomal, Abdukadir Mayow Buunis, and others propelled the band to fame across Somalia, Ethiopia, Djibouti, and Kenya, releasing multiple albums like Volume 1 (1986), Volume 2 (1987), and Volume 5 (1987) before the 1991 Somali Civil War forced disbandment and diaspora to East Africa, Europe, the US, and elsewhere; founders Ujeeri, Qasim, and Dawo resettled in Ohio.[1][2][3] Revived as Dur-Dur Band International in London in 2011 by Ujeeri and manager Liban Noah, with members like singer Mohamed Ahmed Qomal and keyboardist Muhammed Karama, the group toured Europe, saw reissues by Analog Africa (2018) and Awesome Tapes From Africa (2013), and released The Berlin Sessions (2023) despite setbacks from COVID-19 and member retirements.[1][2][4]

The band's legacy endures through rediscovered tapes, Grammy-nominated compilations like Sweet As Broken Dates, and energetic live shows blending original spirit with international lineups from the UK, US, and Sweden, symbolizing Somali music's resilience amid war and exile.[1][2][3]
