## Biography
El Michels Affair & Black Thought refers to the collaborative project between Leon Michels, the founder and leader of the New York-based cinematic soul group El Michels Affair, and Tariq 'Black Thought' Trotter, the co-founder and lead MC of The Roots. Leon Michels, born in 1982, began his career young, appearing on a record at age 16 with the group behind 'Thunder Chicken'. He gained prominence in the early 2000s New York funk and soul scene, founding El Michels Affair in 2005 after leaving Sharon Jones & The Dap-Kings, where he had toured and released albums. The group became known for its wide-ranging cinematic soul sound, serving as the backing band for Wu-Tang Clan members and releasing multiple albums while sharing members with like-minded collectives such as Menahan Street Band and The Budos Band[8][9][10]. Black Thought, originating from South Philadelphia, drew early influences from mixtapes and Stevie Wonder, navigating a challenging upbringing marked by violence, drug dealing, and loss that shaped his introspective lyricism[1][3][5].

The two artists first connected in the 2000s when Black Thought discovered the contemporary soul scene, particularly favoring Michels' Menahan Street Band, founded in 2007. This led to shared fundraising events in NYC and Philly, studio jams, and eventually their full collaboration during the 2020 COVID lockdowns, when Black Thought, freed from his Tonight Show commitments with The Roots, reached out for beats. Michels provided sample-based production drawing from his soul and hip-hop influences, resulting in the 2023 album 'Glorious Game', featuring Black Thought's most personal verses over ominous, bottom-heavy, 1970s-indebted R&B beats[2][3][4][6].

Their musical style blends El Michels Affair's throwback funk, soul, and cinematic production—often using samplers and record crackles—with Black Thought's virtuoso lyricism addressing autobiography, South Philly hardships, societal decay, black life in America, and self-discovery. The project stands as a highlight in Black Thought's series of producer collaborations, showcasing his narrative depth without a full Roots album, and underscores Michels' role as a prolific backdrop producer for major artists[1][3][6][7].
