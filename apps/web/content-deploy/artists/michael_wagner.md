## Biography
Michael Wagner, born and raised in Atlanta, Georgia, began his musical journey as a studio session guitarist before discovering his true passion in DJing and music production. His eclectic tastes draw from house, techno, melodic sounds, and rock-n-roll, blending these influences to create high-energy performances that captivate audiences. Starting with guitar work, Wagner transitioned into DJing, leveraging his unbridled energy and crowd-reading skills to become a sought-after performer across nightlife scenes in California, Indiana, Arizona, Florida, and Nevada. His motto, 'Music Heals,' tattooed on his arm, reflects his belief in music's power to unite and bring joy.

Wagner's career evolved through solo performances and key collaborations, including his work with the international DJ/producer duo DFILA alongside Argentine-Armenian artist Niko SMB (Nicky X Ros). Formed during a two-month production stint in Argentina, DFILA released 'WET (2C)' via Repopulate Mars (under Lee Foss), gaining support from major DJs like SIDEPIECE, followed by upcoming tracks 'Lean Back' and 'Wastin Time' on Deadmau5's Hau5trap label. Demonstrating versatility beyond house and tech, he collaborated with DJ Fredy Muks and singer True Rylan on the 2022 pop/trap single 'A Libra Minus Balance.' Currently, Wagner focuses on original solo music while continuing to push genre boundaries.

His legacy lies in his multi-genre mastery as a DJ, producer, songwriter, and guitarist, inspiring through innovative mashups and trailblazing sounds that bridge rock roots with electronic music, positioning him as an emerging force in the global scene.
