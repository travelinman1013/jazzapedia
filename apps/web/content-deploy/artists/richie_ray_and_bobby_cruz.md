## Biography
Richie Ray (born Richard Maldonado Morales in 1945) and Bobby Cruz formed one of the most influential duos in salsa music history. They met as teenagers in Brooklyn, New York—Richie was born to Puerto Rican parents on Hoyt Street, while Bobby, born in Hormigueros, Puerto Rico, had formed a band that needed a bass player, which Richie joined at age twelve. After working as a Latin band in Catskill Mountain resort hotels to perfect their craft, they recorded their first album, "Ricardo Ray Arrives," in 1965 on Fonseca Records, which was presented at the Village Gate alongside mentor Tito Puente, who would support them throughout their career. Initially, Bobby played guitar and bass while Carlos Arroyo sang, but when Arroyo left, Bobby transitioned to vocals with guidance from mentor Rafael "Chivirico" Dávila, leading to their breakthrough.

From the mid-1960s through the early 1970s, Richie Ray and Bobby Cruz became known as "Los Reyes de la Salsa" (The Kings of Salsa), defining the genre during its formative era. Their music synthesized Afro-Cuban rhythms, jazz, rock and roll, and classical influences—Richie Ray enriched compositions with melodies from Mozart, Beethoven, Bach, and Chopin. Albums like "Jala Jala y Boogaloo" and "El Bestial Sonido de Ricardo Ray & Bobby Cruz" (1972) established them as innovators, earning them nine gold albums and critical acclaim at venues like the Palladium and Bronx Music Palace. Their 1975 hit "La Zafra" won the Festival of Orchestras prize, cementing their status as salsa pioneers.

In 1974, both Ray and Cruz became born-again Christians, leading to a significant shift in their musical direction. They transitioned from secular salsa to "salsa with a message," creating a new style that blended Afro-Caribbean rhythms with jazz and classical elements. Albums like "A Su Nombre Gloria" and songs such as "Juan en la Ciudad" and "Los Fariseos" showcased this evolution. After nearly two decades in Christian music, they reunited in 1999 for a concert in Bayamón, Puerto Rico, which was critically acclaimed and recorded under the Universal label. To date, they have recorded 105 albums, earned twelve gold records, and received three Grammy Awards, including one for Lifetime Achievement, solidifying their legacy as architects of modern salsa music.

## Fun Facts
- Bobby Cruz was originally a guitarist and bass player in his own band before transitioning to vocals; the original singer, Carlos Arroyo, left because he disliked the sound of his own voice, which led to Bobby's unexpected career change as a vocalist.
- In 1974, Richie Ray and Bobby Cruz participated in a 12-hour band contest in Puerto Rico competing against 14 other salsa bands, during an era when traditional musicians resisted the term 'salsa,' arguing it literally meant sauce and was inappropriate for their music.
- At the height of their popularity in 1974, both Richie Ray and Bobby Cruz independently became born-again Christians within months of each other, leading to their separation from secular music and the creation of an entirely new musical genre called 'salsa with a message.'
- In 1998, Bobby Cruz published an autobiography titled 'Cuando era niño' (When I Was a Child) and edited a recording to accompany the book, demonstrating his commitment to preserving their musical and personal legacy.
