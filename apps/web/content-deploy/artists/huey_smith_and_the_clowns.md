## Biography
Huey Pierce 'Piano' Smith was born on January 26, 1934, in the Central City neighborhood of New Orleans, Louisiana. Influenced by Professor Longhair's innovative piano work, he developed his signature shuffling right-handed piano style. At age eight, he wrote 'Robertson Street Boogie,' performing with friend Percy Anderson as Slick and Doc. He attended Walter L. Cohen High School, began club work at 15 with Guitar Slim (Eddie Jones), and signed with Savoy Records in 1952, releasing 'You Made Me Cry.' In 1953, he recorded with Earl King, establishing himself in New Orleans rhythm and blues.[2][3][1]

In the mid-1950s, Smith formed Huey 'Piano' Smith and His Clowns, signing with Ace Records under Johnny Vincent. Featuring vocalist Bobby Marchan, the band scored hits like 'Rockin' Pneumonia and the Boogie Woogie Flu' (1957, Top Five R&B), 'Don't You Just Know It'/'High Blood Pressure' (1958, pop Top Ten), and 'Sea Cruise' (1959, overdubbed by Frankie Ford). Known for novelty tunes, boogie-woogie piano, and comedic stage antics with drag and choreography, they toured widely. Marchan left in 1960 for a solo hit, replaced by Gerri Hall and Curley Moore. Smith briefly joined Imperial, returned to Ace for 'Pop Eye' (1962), and recorded with groups like the Hueys and Pitter Pats.[1][2][3][4]

By the 1960s, chart success faded; Smith converted to Jehovah's Witnesses, retiring from music. He made sporadic comebacks, including 1971's 'Rocking Pneumonia' re-recording, 1979 Jazz & Heritage Festival with reformed Clowns, and 1981 Tipitina's show, but ceased performing thereafter. He died on February 13, 2023, in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, aged 89, leaving a legacy in rock and roll through his infectious New Orleans sound.[2][3]

## Fun Facts
- Bobby Marchan, the Clowns' lead, was a female impersonator who dressed the band in wigs and drag for comedic stage routines, once prompting Huey's mother to dispel rumors her son was 'a big fat sissy.'[4]
- The Clowns' driver was Rudy Ray Moore, later famous as the blue comedian Dolemite.[4]
- 'Sea Cruise' became a hit only after white teen Frankie Ford overdubbed his vocals onto Smith's instrumental track to appeal to pop radio.[1][2]
- Smith named his band after emulating the Coasters, the 'Clown Princes of Rock and Roll,' and modeled their humorous style accordingly.[4]
