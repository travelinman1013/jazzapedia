## Biography
Les Getrex, a self-taught guitarist, singer, and songwriter from New Orleans, Louisiana, began his musical journey after a neighbor recognized his natural talent and invited him to join a band as lead guitarist. Deeply rooted in the New Orleans music scene, he emerged with a notable blues single, 'Don't Say A Mumblin' Word,' in 1976, blending blues, funk, soul, and R&B influences with a gospel-inflected voice and playful performance style.[1][2][3]

Over a career spanning more than thirty years, Getrex has performed extensively in New Orleans venues like The Rock and R&B clubs, released albums such as *300 Miles* on C&M Records featuring tracks like 'One Believer' and remakes of his blues hits, and achieved milestones including his debut leading his own band at the New Orleans Jazz Fest. He tours overseas twice yearly, covering classics by Ray Charles and Otis Redding alongside traditional Mardi Gras songs like 'Indian Red' on his album *Les Getrex Sings The Classics*, and performs on Norwegian Cruise Line ships in their Fat Cats Jazz & Blues Club.[1][3][5][6]

Regarded as one of the last true bluesmen, Getrex's authentic sound embeds New Orleans culture, characterized by emotional delivery—walking through audiences or channeling blues pain on stage—and a loose, professional band dynamic where he focuses on rhythms and fills while showcasing collaborators.[1][3][7]
