## Biography
Junior Sisk is widely regarded as one of the leading voices in traditional bluegrass music today. A native of the Virginia Blue Ridge, specifically from Ferrum in Southwest Virginia, Sisk was born in Arlington, Virginia and raised in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. With roots deeply planted in family tradition—his father a songwriter and guitarist, his mother a singer—Sisk began playing music at age 14. Inspired early on by legends like The Stanley Brothers, Larry Sparks, Dave Evans, and especially the Johnson Mountain Boys, he developed a distinctive hard-driving, emotional style that defines classic bluegrass.

Sisk first made his mark as a songwriter in the early 1990s, penning enduring hits for the Lonesome River Band such as "Game (I Can't Win)" and "Tears Are Blinding Me," which helped the band ascend into bluegrass stardom. His performing career took shape with influential roles in Wyatt Rice & Santa Cruz, Lost & Found, and Blueridge, where he helped shape a powerful blend of modern and traditional bluegrass. In 1998, he formed Junior Sisk & Ramblers Choice, releasing Sounds of the Mountains on Rounder Records. After reforming the group in 2006 following his departure from Blueridge, Sisk launched a successful run with Rebel Records that included the breakthrough 2011 album Heart of a Song, which won IBMA Album of the Year in 2012.

Sisk's accolades solidified his place as a torchbearer for traditional bluegrass, including IBMA Male Vocalist of the Year in 2013, SPBGMA Bluegrass Band of the Year in 2014, and Recorded Event of the Year in 2016 for "Longneck Blues," a duet with Ronnie Bowman. His 2020 album Load the Wagon spent six months at #1 on national charts and earned multiple IBMA nominations. Known for his unmistakable high-lonesome voice and straight-ahead traditional bluegrass sound, Sisk has remained a consistent force in the genre for over 30 years, with his band now recording for Mountain Fever Records.
