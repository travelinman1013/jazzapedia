## Biography
Curtis Stigers was born on October 18, 1965, in Hollywood, California, but grew up in Boise, Idaho, where his passion for music ignited as a teenager. He played in punk and blues bands, received classical training on clarinet and saxophone in high school, and later studied drums in rock bands. After graduating, Stigers moved to New York City in 1987 at age 21 to pursue rock music but gravitated toward the city's blues and jazz clubs, performing as a saxophonist and vocalist in a jazz trio.[1][2][5][6][8]

Stigers burst onto the scene in 1991 with his self-titled debut album on Arista Records, produced by Clive Davis after spotting him in a New York restaurant; it sold over 1.5 million copies worldwide, featuring self-penned pop/soul hits like 'I Wonder Why' (a worldwide top-ten hit), 'You’re All That Matters To Me,' and 'Never Saw A Miracle.' He contributed '(What’s So Funny ‘Bout) Peace Love and Understanding' to The Bodyguard soundtrack, which sold over 45 million copies. In 2001, he pivoted to Concord Jazz, releasing nine genre-bending albums blending jazz with rock, blues, soul, country, and folk influences over 18 years, including Baby Plays Around, Secret Heart, and You Inspire Me. He co-wrote and sang the Emmy-nominated theme 'This Life' for Sons of Anarchy and appeared in Ted and Ted 2.[1][2][3][4][5]

Throughout his career, Stigers has maintained a prolific touring schedule worldwide, performing with artists like Elton John, Eric Clapton, Bonnie Raitt, Prince, Nancy Wilson, and Toots Thielemans, and with symphony orchestras. His versatile style—smooth ballads mixing jazz crooning, pop, R&B, and soul—has earned critical acclaim, DownBeat recognition as a rising jazz star, and praise from JazzTimes as one of the best male jazz singers of his generation. He continues recording from his Idaho home, as seen in recent kitchen sessions.[1][2][3][4]
