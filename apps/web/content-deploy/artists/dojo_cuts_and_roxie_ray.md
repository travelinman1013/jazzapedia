## Biography
Dojo Cuts is an Australian retro soul and funk band formed in late 2008 in Sydney, initially as a six-piece ensemble that quickly rose to prominence as one of the country's hottest heavy funk units. Featuring the powerful, gritty vocals of Roxie Ray (now known as Sarsha Simone), the band blends crisp, tight funky instrumentals inspired by 1960s and 1970s sounds with modern funk elements, creating timeless feel-good music. Their self-titled debut album captured this energy through covers like Stevie Wonder’s “Uptight” and originals such as “The 1-2-3’s,” which gained worldwide radio play and support from DJs including Craig Charles and Nik Weston.[1][2][3][5]

The band's rhythm section delivers heavy breaks, complemented by a harmonious horn section and Roxie Ray's commanding presence, making their live shows explosive crowd-pleasers. Legendary Daptone Records producer Gabriel Roth praised them, writing liner notes for their debut and declaring fandom alongside Neal Sugarman of The Dap-Kings. Following the 2011 debut, they planned a second album in 2012, while Roxie Ray expanded with collaborations on projects by Milano Jazz-Dance Combo, Lack Of Afro, and others; the project has evolved with Sarsha Simone and multi-instrumentalist/producer Nate Goldentone (likely Nate from early listings) at its core, maintaining disciplined arrangements and raw soulful performances.[1][5][6]

Dojo Cuts follows in the vein of Australian funk predecessors like Cookin’ On 3 Burners and The Bamboos, stirring the Southern hemisphere scene and gaining international acclaim for reviving classic soul with fresh appeal, as noted by outlets like Dusty Groove America.
