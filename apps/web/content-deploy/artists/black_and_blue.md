## Biography
Black 'n Blue was formed in 1981 in Portland, Oregon, by childhood friends Jamie St. James (vocals) and Tommy Thayer (guitar), with the lineup completed by Jeff Warner (guitar), Patrick Young (bass), and Pete Holmes (drums).[1] Inspired by the burgeoning hard rock and heavy metal scenes, the band drew influences from Kiss, Aerosmith, and Led Zeppelin, building a local following through relentless gigging and a DIY attitude.[1] The band relocated to Los Angeles and was signed to Geffen Records, where they released four critically acclaimed studio albums throughout the 1980s: their self-titled debut (1984), "Without Love" (1985), "Nasty Nasty" (1986), and "In Heat" (1988).[1][2]

Black 'n Blue's music was characterized by a fusion of hard rock and glam metal, marked by powerful guitar riffs, anthemic choruses, and high-energy performances.[1] Their early albums featured raw energy and catchy hooks, while later releases incorporated more polished production and melodic elements.[1] The band's later albums were notably produced by Gene Simmons of Kiss, which helped them gain visibility in the rock community.[1] Over their tenure in the 1980s, Black 'n Blue sold over a million albums and scored hit singles including "Hold On to 18" and "Miss Mystery," touring relentlessly with major acts like Kiss, Aerosmith, Queensrÿche, and Yngwie Malmsteen.[2]

Despite their critical acclaim and commercial success, Black 'n Blue never achieved the superstar status of some contemporaries and disbanded in 1989.[1][3] However, their legacy endured through the subsequent careers of band members: Tommy Thayer became the lead guitarist for Kiss in 2002, while Jamie St. James fronted Warrant from 2004-2008.[1][2] The band reunited for live performances and released a studio album, "Hell Yeah!," in 2011.[2] Black 'n Blue continues to perform on the live circuit, particularly at rock cruises and festivals, with a current lineup featuring original members Jamie St. James (vocals) and Pete Holmes (drums) alongside Brandon Cook and Bobby Capka (guitars) and Patrick Young (bass).[2]
