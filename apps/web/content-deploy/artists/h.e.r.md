## Biography
Gabriella Sarmiento Wilson, known professionally as H.E.R. (standing for 'Having Everything Revealed'), was born on June 27, 1997, in Vallejo, California, to a Filipina mother and an African American father who was a musician. Displaying prodigious talent from a young age, she joined her father's band by age 7, performing background vocals and mastering instruments like bass, guitar, piano, and drums. At age 9, she made her acting debut in the Nickelodeon film *School Gyrls* and performed at the Apollo Theater, covering Aretha Franklin's 'Freeway of Love.' By age 10, she appeared on the *Today* show playing Alicia Keys' 'If I Ain't Got You' and gained further exposure on shows like *The View*, *Good Morning America*, Maury, and the 2010 BET Awards with Queen Latifah.[1][2][4][5][6]

Signed to RCA Records at 14 in 2011, Wilson released her debut single 'Something to Prove' as Gabi Wilson before reemerging in 2016 as H.E.R. with her self-titled EP *H.E.R. Vol. 1*, embracing anonymity to let her music speak for itself. Her career skyrocketed with hits like 'Best Part' featuring Daniel Caesar, earning her first Grammy in 2018, followed by her debut album *Back of My Mind* in 2021, which topped R&B charts. Known for her R&B style influenced by Prince, Stevie Wonder, Sly and the Family Stone, and Alicia Keys, she has expanded into acting, starring in *The Color Purple* (2023) as Mary 'Squeak' Agnes, and performed at high-profile events like the Super Bowl LVII halftime show in 2024.[1][2][3][5][6][8]

H.E.R. has amassed numerous accolades, including an Academy Award for 'Fight for You' from *Judas and the Black Messiah* (2021), five Grammys, a Children's and Family Emmy, and others, solidifying her legacy as a versatile artist blending soulful R&B with cinematic storytelling and social impact.[2][3][5][8]
