## Biography
Gary Peacock (May 12, 1935 – September 4, 2020) was an American jazz double bassist born in New York City, whose early musical experiences included piano, trumpet, and drums. At age 15, he was profoundly inspired by a Jazz at the Philharmonic concert featuring Oscar Peterson and Ray Brown, leading him to pursue music seriously. After high school in 1953, he studied briefly at Seattle's Schillinger School of Music, but it closed, pushing him into professional gigs influenced by bassists like Paul Chambers, Ray Brown, and Scott LaFaro. In the early 1960s, he married composer Annette Peacock, recorded with Paul Bley (nine albums together), and collaborated with avant-garde figures like Albert Ayler on Spiritual Unity and Bill Evans.

Peacock's career evolved through free jazz and beyond; he moved to New York in 1962, worked with Jimmy Giuffre, Roland Kirk, and Archie Shepp, then joined Ayler's trio in 1964. A period in Japan in the late 1960s led to albums like Eastward, followed by studies in biology at the University of Washington (graduating 1976). He formed the iconic Standards Trio with Keith Jarrett and Jack DeJohnette in 1977, releasing Tales of Another, and taught at Cornish School of the Arts until 1983. His style emphasized melodic freedom, interactive trio playing, and influences from Ornette Coleman, blending post-bop, free jazz, and standards interpretation.

Peacock's legacy endures through over a dozen leader albums, Tethered Moon trio with Masabumi Kikuchi and Paul Motian, and recordings with Marilyn Crispell, Jan Garbarek, and Ralph Towner. His innovative bass lines, transformative 'being played' philosophy, and bridging of jazz eras influenced generations, cementing his status as a pivotal figure in modern jazz bass.

## Fun Facts
- Peacock had a mystical experience at 18 while drumming for his high school class, feeling 'played rather than playing,' which confirmed his musical path.
- He briefly studied biology at the University of Washington, graduating in 1976 after a stint in Japan where he stepped back from music.
- Married to Annette Peacock in the early 1960s, their union produced the innovative Bley-Peacock Synthesizer Show (1968-1971), pioneering live electronic jazz.
