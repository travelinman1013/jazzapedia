## Biography
James Thomas Smith, known professionally as Jamie xx, was born on 28 October 1988 in South London, England. He began his musical career in 2006 by joining the indie pop band the xx with schoolmates Romy Madley Croft and Oliver Sim from the Elliott School in London, a hub for talents like Hot Chip, Burial, and Four Tet. The band's debut album *xx* (2009) achieved platinum status in the UK and won the Mercury Prize, establishing a minimalist pop sound blending indie, R&B, and electronic elements, with Jamie xx as a driving force in production using tools like the MPC he received for his 18th birthday[1][2].

As a solo artist, Jamie xx adopted the moniker in 2009 with a promotional mix for *xx*, followed by acclaimed remixes for artists like Florence + the Machine, Adele, Radiohead, and Gil Scott-Heron's *We're New Here* (2011), which influenced tracks like Drake and Rihanna's 'Take Care'. His debut album *In Colour* (2015) earned a Mercury Prize nomination and a Grammy nod for Best Dance/Electronic Album, while his 2024 release *In Waves* featured a darker, broodier electronic style with club-ready production[1][2][4]. He has also produced for major artists including Drake, Alicia Keys, Tyler, the Creator, and his xx bandmates' solo projects like Oliver Sim's *Hideous Bastard* (2022) and Romy's *Mid Air* (2023)[1][4][5].

Jamie xx's style fuses UK garage, house, R&B, and indie, pioneering minimalist electronic pop and becoming a defining DJ and producer of his generation. His legacy includes shaping dancefloor soundtracks, collaborating across genres, and evolving from band member to solo innovator, with ongoing work hinted at for future xx material despite diverging solo paths[1][2][4].
