## Biography
Thamires Tannous was born in Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul, in central Brazil, a region rich with forests, rivers, and the Pantanal wetland, which deeply influenced her connection to nature—a recurring theme in her songwriting. Showing prodigious talent from a young age, she performed at age 2 using a key as a microphone, composed songs on her mother's piano by age 4, and studied violin for five years starting at 8, before discovering her calling as a singer during orchestra performances. Influenced by her mother's love for MPB artists like Gilberto Gil, Elis Regina, and Caetano Veloso, and her father's traditional Brazilian folk and Lebanese Arabic music, she graduated with a bachelor's in Popular Singing from Souza Lima College in São Paulo and studied jazz and improvisation at Didier Lockwood's school in France.[1][2][3]

Her career launched with the 2014 debut album 'Canto para Aldebarã,' produced by Dante Ozzetti, honoring her Lebanese heritage through Arab percussion blended with contemporary Brazilian melodies, earning critical acclaim and the 2015 Prêmio Grão de Música for 'JÁ DEU!'. In 2019, she released 'Canto-correnteza,' produced by Michi Ruzitschka, fusing Afro-Brazilian percussion with diverse rhythms, featuring artists like Chico César and Vincent Segal. She has performed across Brazil, Austria, Germany, Portugal, and France, and in 2021 participated in the UK-based 'Making Tracks Music' residency, yielding a 2022 live album. Recent singles include 'É só deixar' (2022) with Carlos Malta and 'Bebuia' (2023) with Momi Maiga and Michi Ruzitschka. Now based between São Paulo and Vienna, her style merges regional Mato Grosso do Sul sounds, MPB, and global influences in the new MPB genre.[1][3][5]

Though still rising, Tannous has gained national recognition in Brazil through awards and tours, with her profound voice and nature-inspired lyrics positioning her as a bridge between traditional Brazilian heritage and contemporary innovation.
