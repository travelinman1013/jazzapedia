## Biography
The Milk Carton Kids are an American indie folk duo consisting of Joey Ryan and Kenneth Pattengale, who came together in 2011 after both had pursued individual careers as solo singer-songwriters.[1] Ryan grew up in a household filled with marquee artists of the 1960s and 1970s—Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, Simon & Garfunkel, and Neil Young—and learned guitar from his mother, who sang in a folk duo in Berkeley, California.[3] The duo quickly realized they could find their authentic voice and forge a distinct identity by working together in harmony rather than individually, with their vocal blend and songwriting partnership becoming central to their artistic identity.[1] Based in Los Angeles and Eagle Rock, California, they have released six studio albums as of their seventh album 'I Only See The Moon,' establishing themselves as significant figures in contemporary indie folk music.[1]

The band's name derives from one of their early songs, 'Milk Carton Kid,' which contains the lyric "I don't feel the pain I once did, one day it just vanished like a Milk Carton Kid."[3][4] The metaphor references the awkwardness of youth that dissipates upon coming of age, though it also carries deeper historical resonance—referring to the 1980s and 1990s phenomenon in the United States where photographs of missing children were printed on milk cartons, a practice initiated by Midwestern dairies to aid law enforcement.[1] This generational specificity appealed to both Ryan and Pattengale, who were born in 1982 and came of age around the year 2000.[1] Despite Joey Ryan's stated self-consciousness about the band name over the years, the duo has maintained it throughout their career.[1]

The Milk Carton Kids' musical approach emphasizes minimalist arrangements and folk traditions while continuously seeking fresh sonic territory.[1] Their career has been marked by significant life events that influenced their work: Kenneth Pattengale underwent cancer surgery (and is now cancer-free) and Joey Ryan became a father of two while also working as a producer on Chris Thile's 'Live from Here' radio show, the reboot of 'A Prairie Home Companion.'[5][7] The duo took their first substantial break from touring and recording after eight years on the road, which initially created tension but ultimately reinvigorated their creative partnership and led them to expand their sound by occasionally incorporating additional musicians in the studio.[5] Their work has been featured in television productions, including a cover of 'Simone' by England Dan & John Ford Coley for the HBO series 'Vinyl.'[6]

## Fun Facts

- Both Joey Ryan and Kenneth Pattengale were born in 1982 and turned eighteen in the year 2000, making them 'xennials' or 'elder millennials'—a generation that specifically experienced the milk carton missing children phenomenon during their childhood.[1]
- The duo took their first real break from touring and recording after eight years on the road, during which they initially felt creatively stifled by their minimalist two-person format but ultimately rediscovered their love for performing as a duo.[5]
- The Milk Carton Kids portrayed England Dan and John Ford Coley in the HBO series 'Vinyl,' and their cover of 'Simone' by England Dan & John Ford Coley was featured in the show's soundtrack.[6]
