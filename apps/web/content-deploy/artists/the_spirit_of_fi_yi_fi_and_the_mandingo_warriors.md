## Biography
The Spirit of Fi Yi Yi and the Mandingo Warriors is a New Orleans-based Black Masking Indian gang and musical ensemble led by Big Chief Victor Harris. Harris began his masking journey at age 15 as a flag boy for the Yellow Pocahontas, a tribe led by the legendary Big Chief Allison "Tootie" Montana.[5] In 1984, Harris founded the Mandingo Warriors and became known as the Spirit of Fi Yi Yi, establishing himself as a cultural leader in New Orleans' Black Indian tradition.[6] Over his 59-year masking career, Harris and the Mandingo Warriors became known for blending African percussion traditions with New Orleans' distinctive musical and cultural practices, performing at venues ranging from the White House to Paris, France.[2]

The ensemble's musical style is deeply rooted in African drumming and percussion traditions, incorporating hand-sewn ceremonial suits adorned with cowrie shells, corn husk ribbons, sequins, beads, and gems that reflect African masking heritage.[5] Beginning in 1992, Wesley joined the group to play African bass drum on Mardi Gras Day, and for the next 30 years, the Mandingo Warriors performed New Orleans' music with African drums at major festivals and cultural events.[2] In 2018, Wesley co-authored the book "Fire in the Hole: The Spirit Work of FIYIYI & The Mandingo Warriors," which documented the group's cultural significance and spiritual mission.[2] Harris's retirement celebration in February 2026 at the New Orleans Museum of Art honored his legacy as the longest continuously masking Black Masking Indian and his profound impact on preserving and advancing African-rooted musical and cultural traditions in New Orleans.[5]
