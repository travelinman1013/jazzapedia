## Biography
U2 is an Irish rock band formed in Dublin in 1976 when four teenagers—Larry Mullen Jr., Paul Hewson (Bono), David Evans (the Edge), and Adam Clayton—met at Mount Temple Comprehensive School.[1] The band began modestly, with Mullen posting a "musicians wanted" notice on the school's bulletin board on September 25, 1976, leading to their first rehearsal in his kitchen.[1][2] Initially calling themselves "Feedback" and later "The Hype," the group eventually settled on the name U2, inspired by the famous Cold War spy plane.[3] Though the members had limited musical proficiency, they were inspired by the punk rock movement sweeping Europe in the late 1970s and believed that technical skill was not a prerequisite for success.[1] With manager Paul McGuinness's guidance from 1978 onward, U2 built a local following through performances across Dublin, including a series of shows at the Dandelion Market in 1979.[1]

U2 achieved commercial and critical success throughout the 1980s and beyond, establishing themselves as one of the world's most innovative and popular rock bands.[3] Their early albums—*Boy* (1980), *War* (1983), and *The Joshua Tree* (1987)—showcased their distinctive sound, characterized by the Edge's minimal, reverb-drenched guitar work and Bono's expressive, quasi-operatic vocals.[1][3] Albums like *War* produced politically conscious singles such as "Sunday Bloody Sunday" and "Pride (In the Name of Love)," cementing their reputation as socially aware artists.[1] The band continued to evolve musically, experimenting with electronic and industrial influences on *Achtung Baby* (1991), *Zooropa* (1993), and *Pop* (1997), before returning to a more conventional mainstream sound with *All That You Can't Leave Behind* (2000) and *How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb* (2004).[1] Beyond their musical achievements, U2 became known as "the conscience of arena rock," using their massive worldwide platform to advocate for social and political causes.[4]

The band's influence extends across multiple decades of popular music, with their anthemic sound and innovative production techniques shaping rock music's trajectory. Their collaboration with producers like Steve Lillywhite, Brian Eno, and Daniel Lanois resulted in some of the most acclaimed albums in rock history.[2] U2's legacy encompasses not only their commercial success—including multimillion-selling albums and number-one hits—but also their commitment to using their platform for activism and social change, making them one of the most significant rock bands of the late 20th and early 21st centuries.

## Fun Facts
- U2's name was suggested by a friend and also evoked the famous U-2 spy plane used by the United States during the Cold War.[3]
- In 1981, U2 opened for Thin Lizzy at the inaugural Slane Concert, which the Edge later called one of U2's worst shows, contributing to a period of self-doubt for the band.[1]
- Bono, the Edge, and Larry Mullen Jr. were members of a Charismatic Christian group called the "Shalom Fellowship" in Dublin, which led them to question their involvement in rock music and nearly caused the band to break up before they decided to leave the group instead.[1]
- On September 9, 2014, U2 unexpectedly appeared at Apple's iPhone and Apple Watch launch at Cupertino, where they performed the new song "The Miracle (Of Joey Ramone)" and announced a new album collaboration with Apple.[2]
