## Biography
La Sonora Carruseles is a Colombian salsa band formed in 1995 in Medellín by Mario Rincón 'Pachanga', who served as the musical director at Discos Fuentes record company. The group began as an experimental project following a sound rehearsal, which led to the approval and release of their debut album *Espectacular* that same year. Specializing in **salsa dura** (hardcore salsa), they blend traditional rhythms with modern digital production, paying tribute to classic salsa styles while innovating within the genre.[1][2]

Over the years, Sonora Carruseles has released numerous albums, including *Salsa y Fuego* (1996), *Heavy Salsa* (1998), *La Salsa La Traigo Yo* (2003), and *Se Prendió La Rumba* (2015), maintaining a steady output every few years. The band has toured extensively across Europe and Latin America, gaining popularity in Spanish-speaking countries, and now features a multinational lineup with members from various Latin American countries, half of whom are Colombian. Currently led by Manolo Puerto and musically directed by Morist Jimenez Jr., they are based in Medellín, though some sources mention connections to Miami.[1][2][4]

Their international recognition surged in August 2015 when U.S. President Barack Obama added their song 'La Salsa la Traigo Yo!' to his personal #POTUS playlist, sparking global interest. The band's music has also appeared in televised competitions like *So You Think You Can Dance*, solidifying their legacy as ambassadors of Colombian salsa with a focus on energetic, danceable **salsa dura**.[1]
