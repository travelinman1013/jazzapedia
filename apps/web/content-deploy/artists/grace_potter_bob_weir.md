## Biography
Grace Potter is a Vermont native born at midnight on June 20, 1983, in Waitsfield, known for her powerful vocals, multi-instrumental skills on guitar and keyboards, and high-energy live performances. She rose to prominence with her band Grace Potter and the Nocturnals, releasing breakthrough albums like the 2010 self-titled record featuring tracks such as 'Medicine' and 'Paris (Ooh La La),' followed by 'The Lion the Beast the Beat' in 2012 and her solo debut 'Midnight' in 2015. Her style blends rock, jam band elements, and covers of classics, often delivering frenetic, impassioned sets that captivate audiences, as seen in her 75-minute performance at Sound Summit in 2018 shortly after giving birth to her first child.[2][7][8]

Bob Weir, born in 1947, co-founded the Grateful Dead in 1965 at age 17 alongside Jerry Garcia, developing from a novice rhythm guitarist—briefly fired in 1967 for limited skills—to a key songwriter partnering with John Perry Barlow on cowboy-inspired tunes like those on 'American Beauty' and 'Workingman's Dead.' His unique voice contributed jazz-infused works like the 'Weather Report Suite' on 1973's 'Wake of the Flood.' Post-Dead, Weir continued with projects like Wolf Bros.[1][4]

The pairing of 'Grace Potter, Bob Weir' on Spotify (popularity 53, genres unknown) reflects their notable collaborations, including duets on Grateful Dead's 'Friend of the Devil' at Sound Summit 2018 near Mill Valley, CA, and the 2015 'Dear Jerry' tribute concert celebrating Jerry Garcia, where they delivered an emotional, slow rendition—Potter's first Dead song exposure. These performances highlight Potter's admiration for Dead music and Weir's enduring legacy in jam and improvisational rock.[1][2][3]
