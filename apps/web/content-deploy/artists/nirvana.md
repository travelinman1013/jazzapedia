## Biography
Nirvana, the seminal grunge band, was formed in 1987 in Aberdeen, Washington, by vocalist/guitarist Kurt Cobain (born February 20, 1967, in Aberdeen, Washington; died April 5, 1994, in Seattle) and bassist Krist Novoselic (born May 16, 1965, in Compton, California). Cobain, who grew up in the rural logging town of Aberdeen amid a tumultuous childhood and family breakdown, dropped out of high school and bonded with Novoselic over punk and metal music. They experimented with early bands like Fecal Matter, Stiff Woodies, Skid Row, and The Sellouts before settling on Nirvana, recruiting various drummers including Aaron Burckhard, Dale Crover, and Chad Channing. Inspired by punk acts like Black Flag and the Melvins, as well as Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin, they recorded their debut album *Bleach* in 1989 with Sub Pop, marking their entry into Seattle's burgeoning grunge scene.[1][2][3][5][6]

In 1990, drummer Dave Grohl (born January 14, 1969, in Warren, Ohio) joined, solidifying the classic lineup after signing with DGC Records at the recommendation of Sonic Youth's Kim Gordon. Their 1991 breakthrough album *Nevermind*, produced by Butch Vig, exploded with the single 'Smells Like Teen Spirit,' catapulting grunge to mainstream success and voicing Generation X disillusionment through raw, distorted guitars, heavy riffs, and Cobain's anguished lyrics blending punk aggression with melodic hooks.[2][3][5][6] Despite rapid fame, internal tensions and Cobain's struggles with addiction and health persisted, leading to the abrasive *In Utero* (1993) and MTV Unplugged session, before Cobain's suicide in 1994 ended the band.[6]

Nirvana's legacy endures as pioneers of grunge and alternative rock, shifting music from hair metal to raw authenticity, influencing countless artists, and achieving enduring popularity (Spotify: 83) in genres like grunge and rock.

## Fun Facts

- Early band The Sellouts ended when bassist Steve Newman attacked Cobain with a vacuum cleaner.[3]
- Cobain was so nervous auditioning for the Melvins that he couldn't play a note.[4]
