## Biography
Nathaniel Adams Coles, known as Nat King Cole, was born on March 17, 1919, in Montgomery, Alabama, into a musical family and raised in Chicago after his father became a pastor. He learned piano and organ from his mother, the church organist, debuting musically at age four, and by 12 was performing in church. At 17, he formed his first jazz group, the Royal Dukes, and in 1936 recorded with his brother Eddie's Solid Swingers for Decca. After touring with Shuffle Along in 1937, he settled in Los Angeles, forming the King Cole Trio (initially King Cole and His Swingsters) with guitarist Oscar Moore and bassist Wesley Prince, featuring a unique drummerless swing style with innovative piano-guitar voicings.[1][2][3]

## Fun Facts
- The King Cole Trio's unorthodox drummerless lineup—piano, guitar, and bass—created a delicate swing sound that juxtaposed piano and guitar to mimic a single instrument, standing out against the big band era.[1][3]
- The trio's name originated from club owner Bob Lewis suggesting Cole assemble a small band for his Swanee Inn in 1937, leading to their formation.[1]
- In 1956, Nat King Cole was attacked on stage in Alabama by White Citizens Council members during a kidnapping attempt but completed the show and vowed never to return to the South.[2]
- Cole's daughter Natalie Cole posthumously duetted with him on 'Unforgettable' in 1991, earning seven Grammys in 1992.[2]
