## Biography
Barbara Mason, born on August 9, 1947, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, entered the music industry as a teenager initially focusing on songwriting. At age 12, she led groups after winning local talent shows, and by 17, she released her debut single 'Girls Have Feelings Too' on Arctic Records, introduced by deejay Jimmy Bishop. Her breakthrough came in 1965 with the self-written 'Yes, I'm Ready,' peaking at No. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100 and No. 2 on R&B, exemplifying the emerging Philly soul sound with her high, girlish vocals.[1][2][7][8]
