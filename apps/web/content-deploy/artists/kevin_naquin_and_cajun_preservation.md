## Biography
Kevin Naquin is a Cajun accordion player and vocalist from Ossun, Louisiana, who has dedicated his career to preserving and advancing traditional Cajun music.[1][5] Born into a musical family with deep roots in Louisiana's Cajun heritage, Naquin began playing accordion at age 13, quickly demonstrating exceptional talent by placing second in the 1994 junior accordion contest at Mulate's Restaurant in Breaux Bridge.[1] His musical lineage includes two great-grandfathers who were legendary Cajun musicians: accordionist Hadley Fontenot and fiddler Edius Naquin, both of whom helped sustain Cajun music during the lean years before the Cajun renaissance of the 1960s and 70s.[1]

Naquin's professional career took off in the late 1990s, with his recording debut coming in 1997 on cassette.[1] Between 2000 and 2004, he won over a dozen awards from the Cajun French Music Association (CFMA), including multiple Band of the Year, Accordionist of the Year, and Best Recording of the Year honors.[1][2] His band, the Ossun Playboys, became one of South Louisiana's most respected Cajun ensembles, known for their powerful performances that blend traditional Cajun sounds with contemporary influences.[1] In 2004 alone, Naquin and his band dominated the Le Cajun Awards, winning Band of the Year, Best Recording of the Year for "Bayou Groove," Song of the Year for "C'est trop tard," and Accordionist of the Year.[1]

Beyond his musical achievements, Naquin has become a cultural ambassador and political figure, serving as a Republican member of the Lafayette Parish Council.[5][6] Through his project "Kevin Naquin & Cajun Preservation," he remains dedicated to keeping the classic sound of Cajun music alive, specializing in everything from energetic two-steps to soulful waltzes.[3] His vision extends beyond personal recognition; as he stated, "All I want to do is be recognized 50 years down the road as a pioneer and a band that provided Cajun music."[4]
