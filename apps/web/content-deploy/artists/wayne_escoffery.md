## Biography
Wayne Escoffery is a Grammy Award-winning tenor saxophonist born on February 23, 1975, in London, England.[2] He moved to the United States in 1983 and settled in New Haven, Connecticut in 1986, where his formal music education began at age eleven when he joined The New Haven Trinity Boys Choir and started taking private saxophone lessons.[2] Despite growing up in a relatively non-musical household, Escoffery discovered his passion for jazz and studied at the Neighborhood Music School, ACES Educational Center for the Arts, and the Jazzmobile in New York City.[1] He became a protégé of saxophone legend Jackie McLean at The Hartt School, where he graduated summa cum laude with a bachelor's degree in jazz performance, and later earned a Master of Music degree from the Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz Performance at the New England Conservatory, studying under jazz giants including George Coleman, Jimmy Heath, Don Braden, Clark Terry, Ron Carter, Barry Harris, and Charlie Persip.[1]

Since moving to New York City in 1999-2000, Escoffery has established himself as one of the jazz world's most talented and in-demand saxophonists.[1][2] He began his professional New York career as a sideman with the Eric Reed Septet and became a steady member of the Mingus Big Band, Orchestra, and Dynasty from 2001 onwards, contributing to their Grammy Award-winning album "Live at The Jazz Standard."[5] In 2006, he secured a coveted frontline position in Tom Harrell's working quintet, with whom he toured globally and recorded seven studio albums while co-producing four of those releases over more than a decade.[1][4] Escoffery has recorded ten studio albums as a leader and currently leads The Wayne Escoffery Quartet featuring pianist David Kikoski, bassist Ugonna Okegwo, and drummer Ralph Peterson.[1] He is also the founder of the Black Art Jazz Collective and serves as a musical director of The Mingus Big Band.[4]

Escoffery is recognized as a 2014 and 2021 Downbeat Critics Poll Winner for both tenor and soprano saxophones and is known for his beautiful tone, impressive technique, and versatility.[2][4] Over his career, he has performed and recorded with an extensive roster of jazz luminaries including Ron Carter, Ben Riley, Abdulah Ibrahim, Carl Allen, Al Foster, Billy Hart, Eddie Henderson, Rufus Reid, Wallace Roney, Randy Brecker, and Herbie Hancock.[4][5] His work with Jazz At Lincoln Center's Music Of The Masters, a group assembled by Wynton Marsalis to honor the music of Dexter Gordon and Miles Davis, further solidified his reputation as a rising star in contemporary jazz.[3]
