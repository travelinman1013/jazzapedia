## Biography
The Po' Ramblin' Boys, a bluegrass band, formed in 2014 at the Ole Smoky Moonshine Distillery in Gatlinburg or Sevierville, Tennessee, on the Tennessee side of the Smoky Mountains. Founded by mandolinist and bandleader C.J. Lewandowski, the group began as a house band, recruiting longtime friends banjoist Jereme Brown (then a welder), guitarist Josh Rinkel (running a sign company), and bassist Jasper Lorentzen (working in the distillery tasting room). They played extended sets multiple times a week for visitors, honing their neo-traditional, hard-charging bluegrass sound characterized by heartfelt vocals, thrilling harmonies, and straightforward instrumentation, quickly gaining attention that led to their first out-of-town gig in Alberta, Canada, and a European tour shortly after.[1][2][3][4][5]

Over the next decade, the band evolved through lineup changes while building a prolific career, touring extensively across the US and Europe, releasing albums on prestigious labels like Smithsonian Folkways and Rounder Records, and earning major accolades. They were named Emerging Artist of the Year at the 2018 IBMA Bluegrass Music Awards, received multiple IBMA Entertainer of the Year nominations, and garnered a Grammy nomination for Best Bluegrass Album for 2019's 'Toil, Tears & Trouble.' Their music reflects the ramblin' life they live, with hits like the No. 1 Bluegrass Unlimited chart single 'Wanderers Like Me' from their recent album, emphasizing themes of road-weariness, longing, and unyielding passion for bluegrass.[1][2][3][4]

As they entered their second decade, the band maintained momentum with a refreshed lineup including younger members guitarist John Gooding from California and fiddler Max Silverstein from Maine, alongside veterans Lewandowski, Brown, and Lorentzen. Known for their slick western wear, archival approach to tradition, and commitment to 'true-blue' bluegrass, they continue headlining festivals, appearing at events like IBMA Bluegrass Live!, and planning new recordings to push the genre forward while honoring its roots.[1][2][3][6]

## Fun Facts
- The band formed spontaneously when the Ole Smoky Distillery asked C.J. Lewandowski to assemble a full-time house band, pulling in friends from non-music day jobs like welding and sign-making.
- Their first gigs beyond the distillery were a festival in Alberta, Canada, followed immediately by a two-week European tour, marking an explosive start after just 1.5 years of local playing.
- Bandleader C.J. Lewandowski produced and captured the swan song recordings of bluegrass legend Bobby Osborne (of the Osborne Brothers) before his passing in 2023.
- Sevierville, their home base, is Dolly Parton's hometown, which they highlight in interviews as a point of local pride.
