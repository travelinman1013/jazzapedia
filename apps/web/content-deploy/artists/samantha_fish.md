## Biography
Samantha Fish, born January 30, 1989, in Kansas City, Missouri, grew up immersed in music influenced by her mother's role as a church choir instructor and her father's casual guitar playing with friends. Initially playing drums, she switched to guitar at age 15 after discovering artists like Bonnie Raitt, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Tom Petty, and the Rolling Stones, particularly their album *Sticky Fingers*. As a teenager, she frequented Knuckleheads Saloon to hear touring blues acts and, after turning 18, began sitting in with performers, honing her skills across blues, rock, funk, and other genres.[1][2][3]

Fish launched her career in 2009 with the self-produced live album *Live Bait*, which led to a deal with Ruf Records and the collaborative project *Girls with Guitars* (2011) alongside Cassie Taylor and Dani Wilde. Her solo breakthrough came with *Runaway* (2011), produced by mentor Mike Zito, earning her the 2012 Blues Music Award for Best New Artist. Subsequent releases like *Black Wind Howlin'* (2013), *Chills & Fever* (2017), *Kill or Be Kind* (2019), the collaborative *Death Wish Blues* with Jesse Dayton (2023), and *Paper Doll* (2025) showcased her evolving style blending blues rock with country, funk, and ballads, garnering two Grammy nominations for Best Contemporary Blues Album.[1][5]

Fish's legacy includes over 20 awards, performances with icons like Buddy Guy, Slash, and The Rolling Stones, and headlining major festivals. Her powerful guitar work, visceral rhythms, and emotive vocals have established her as one of the foremost guitarists of her generation, with a career marked by relentless touring and critical acclaim.[1][2][4]
