## Biography
William Henry 'Chick' Webb was born on February 10, 1905, in Baltimore, Maryland, where he faced significant physical challenges from tuberculosis and a deformed spine from a young age, standing only about four feet tall. Despite these hardships, he discovered drumming as therapeutic, dropping out of school early and honing his skills without learning to read music by memorizing arrangements. In 1924, he moved to New York City, sitting in with luminaries like Johnny Hodges, Benny Carter, and Duke Ellington, before forming his Jungle Band in 1926 and the Harlem Stompers in 1927, which evolved into the Chick Webb Orchestra by the early 1930s.[1][2][3][7]

Webb's orchestra became legendary at Harlem's Savoy Ballroom starting in 1931, earning him titles like 'King of Swing' and 'King of the Savoy' through victorious 'cutting contests' against bands led by Count Basie, Fletcher Henderson, and Benny Goodman. His innovative drumming style emphasized forceful timekeeping, soloistic flair, cymbal interplay, and integration of drums into big band arrangements, defining swing precision and driving lindy hop dances. In 1935, he hired 17-year-old Ella Fitzgerald as vocalist, adopting her as his daughter; their hits like 'A-Tisket, A-Tasket' (1938) and 'Stompin' at the Savoy' (1934) brought national fame via radio, Decca Records, and venues like the Metropolitan Opera House.[1][2][3][4][5][6]

Despite declining health from his rigorous schedule, Webb remained a swing era titan until his death from tuberculosis on June 16, 1939, in Baltimore at age 34. Fitzgerald led the band briefly afterward. His legacy as a virtuoso showman and drumming innovator influenced big band evolution and inspired generations of musicians.[1][2][5][6][7]
