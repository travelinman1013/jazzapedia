## Biography
Masters of Reality is an American rock band formed in 1981 in Syracuse, New York by vocalist and guitarist Chris Goss and guitarist Tim Harrington.[1][2] Initially conceived as a two-piece electronic and guitar project mixing Kraftwerk-inspired synthesizers with heavy Black Sabbath-influenced riffs, the band expanded to a four-piece lineup in the mid-1980s to incorporate live drums and greater spontaneity.[4][5] The band's name originated from a Warner Bros. pressing of Black Sabbath's 1971 album Master of Reality that had misprinted labels reading "Masters of Reality."[5] After catching their attention through demo tapes and live performances, Rick Rubin signed the band to Def American in 1988, releasing their self-titled debut album that would become a cult classic despite limited mainstream success.[4][5]

Following the dissolution of their original lineup in 1989, Masters of Reality underwent a dramatic transformation when legendary Cream drummer Ginger Baker joined the band for their 1992 album Sunrise on the Sufferbus, which produced the Top 10 chart hit "She Got Me (When She Got Her Dress On)."[1][2] Baker's departure after approximately one year led to the recruitment of Victor Indrizzo, formerly of Circus of Power.[1][2] Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, the band released several albums including Welcome to the Western Lodge (1999), the collaborative Deep in the Hole (2001) with Queens of the Stone Age, and Give Us Barabbas (2004).[2][6] Chris Goss remained the sole consistent member throughout the band's evolution, establishing himself as a prominent producer for desert rock and stoner rock acts including Kyuss, Queens of the Stone Age, and Soulwax.[1]

After a fifteen-year hiatus, Masters of Reality returned to active status in 2024 with the single "Sugar," a collaboration between Goss and Alain Johannes, followed by the 2025 album The Archer.[6] The band's musical output has ranged across stoner metal, progressive art rock, and pop influences, reflecting Goss's eclectic artistic vision.[1] The current lineup features Chris Goss on vocals and guitar, John Leamy on drums, and Paul Powell on bass guitar, with the band resuming live performances at major European festivals including Desertfest in London and Berlin in 2024.[6]

## Fun Facts
- The band's name originated from a manufacturing error: a Warner Bros. pressing of Black Sabbath's Master of Reality album had misprinted labels that read 'Masters of Reality' instead, which Chris Goss adopted for his project.[5]
- On September 10, 1989, after a tense gig at The Cubby Hole near Chicago's Wrigley Field where internal band tensions had reached a breaking point, Chris Goss called Delicious Vinyl co-founder Matt Dike from a phone booth in desperation, leading to significant changes in the band's direction.[5]
- Legendary Cream drummer Ginger Baker, one of rock music's most influential percussionists, joined Masters of Reality for their 1992 album Sunrise on the Sufferbus, which produced a Top 10 chart hit, though Baker departed after only about one year with the band.[1][2]
- Chris Goss has become a highly respected producer in the desert rock and stoner rock scenes, working with artists including Kyuss, Soulwax, Melissa Auf der Maur, and The Eighties Matchbox B-Line Disaster, while remaining the sole consistent member of Masters of Reality throughout the band's 45-year existence.[1]
