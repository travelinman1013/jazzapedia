## Biography
Arthur Foy was born in Alabama, raised in Mississippi, and later transplanted to Louisiana, where he emerged as a compelling entertainer known for his soulful performances with his own band and show.[1] Active primarily in the 1970s and 1980s, Foy recorded his standout single 'Love Dreams' in 1980, a deep, breezy soul masterpiece featuring rich vocals, expert instrumentation, prominent Rhodes piano, and meticulous production that has since become highly sought after by collectors.[1][2][3] The original MCS 45 pressing is exceptionally rare, with only seven documented copies noted on auction sites, one of which sold for $709 in 2009.[1][3]

On the B-side, 'Love Storm' showcased Foy's southern soul strut, co-produced and co-written with the legendary Carl Marshall, building dynamically as its title implies and adding significant credentials to the release.[1] Foy's music exemplified the raw, emotive style of regional southern soul, earning him a cult following among DJs and enthusiasts despite limited commercial output.[1][2] He passed away in 2018, leaving behind a cherished legacy preserved through reissues like the Izipho Soul vinyl edition dedicated to his memory.[1]
