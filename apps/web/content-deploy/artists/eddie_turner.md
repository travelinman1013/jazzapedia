## Biography
Eddie 'Devil Boy' Turner, born in Cuba and raised in Chicago, Illinois, discovered his passion for music at age 12, inspired by the Beatles, Rolling Stones, and live performances by Cream and Jimi Hendrix with the Soft Machine in 1969. His uncle introduced him to jazz guitarists like George Benson and Wes Montgomery, while Chicago blues legends such as Howlin’ Wolf, Muddy Waters, Hound Dog Taylor, and Son Seals shaped his early sound, blended with jazz influences from Jimmy Smith and Phil Upchurch. Attending the University of Colorado in the early 1970s, he studied liberal arts, played in the region's first punk/R&B band The Immortal Nightflames, and joined Mother Earth, backing Tracy Nelson.

Turner's career advanced in the late 1970s and early 1980s with the Legendary 4-Nikators and as lead guitarist for Zephyr's final album, *Heartbeat* (1982), following the death of singer Candy Givens in 1984. He briefly left music for real estate in Denver but returned in the mid-1990s, joining Ron Miles' electric band (*My Cruel Heart*, 1996) and, at the invitation of friend Kenny Passarelli, forming the Otis Taylor Band, contributing psychedelic guitar to five albums over a decade until 2004. His style fuses Afro-Cuban rhythms, Chicago blues, psychedelic rock, jazz, and funk, earning praise as a 'psychedelic blues guitar hero' evoking Jeff Beck, Jimi Hendrix, and Tommy Bolin.

In 2005, Turner signed with NorthernBlues Music, releasing *Rise* (nominated for Blues Music Award Best New Artist Debut), *The Turner Diaries* (2006, Independent Music Awards Vox Pop winner for Best Blues Album), *Miracles & Demons* (2010, Blues Blast nominee for Best Contemporary Album), a live album *Naked In Your Face* (2016), and later *Change in Me*. Now based in Denver, Colorado, he performs solo as a singer/songwriter/guitarist, celebrated for dynamic, genre-blending urban blues.
