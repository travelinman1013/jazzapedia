## Biography
Brenda & The Tabulations were an American R&B group formed in 1966 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, emerging from a chance encounter between lead singer Brenda J. Payton and Maurice Coates, who worked together as counselors at a summer camp in downtown Philadelphia during the summer of 1966.[1][2] When they performed songs for the children at the end of the season, producer Gilda Woods overheard them singing and was impressed by their sound.[2][3] Two days later, after Coates and Payton hastily composed "Dry Your Eyes," Woods brought them to producer Bob Finiz at Jamie/Guyden Records, where they recorded their debut single.[3] The group's name was created by Maurice Coates, who chose "Tabulations" to represent counting money, reflecting the group's aspirations for commercial success.[1] With the addition of Eddie Jackson and James Rucker (later replaced by Jerry Jones), Brenda & The Tabulations quickly rose to prominence in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

The group achieved significant commercial success with their debut single "Dry Your Eyes" (1967), which reached number 20 on the pop charts and number 2 on the R&B charts, becoming an instant smash that launched them into national touring.[1][2][4] From 1967 to 1969, they charted six masterpieces on the Dionn label and continued recording for various imprints including Philco-Ford, Top & Bottom (operated by their manager Gilda Woods), and later Epic Records and Chocolate City Records.[2][4] Another major hit, "Right On The Tip Of My Tongue" (1971), reached number 23 on the pop charts and number 5 on the R&B charts.[2][4] The group's versatility was notable, sometimes featuring male vocalists and eventually evolving into an all-girl trio with Brenda Payton, Pat Mercer, and Deborah Martin by the early 1970s.[3] Throughout their career, Brenda and Maurice Coates remained the consistent core members, touring extensively on the soul circuit and becoming popular live performers.

Brenda J. Payton, born October 24, 1945, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, began her singing career at age 14 as part of a group called The Joyettes (also referenced as The Joyous) with sisters Joyce and Carol Jefferson before forming Brenda & The Tabulations.[1][2][4] The group released three albums: "Dry Your Eyes" (1967), "Brenda and the Tabulations" (1970), and "I Keep Coming Back for More" (1977).[2][4] Payton passed away on June 14, 1992, in Philadelphia, leaving behind a legacy as a pioneering figure in Philadelphia soul music.[2][4] Though the group disbanded in the late 1970s, their influence on soul and R&B music endured, with their original recordings being reissued and compiled on various collections, cementing their place in the history of classic soul music.
