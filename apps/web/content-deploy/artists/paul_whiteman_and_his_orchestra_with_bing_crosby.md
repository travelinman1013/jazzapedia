## Biography
Paul Samuel Whiteman (March 28, 1890 – December 29, 1967) was an American bandleader, composer, orchestral director, and violinist born in Denver, Colorado. His early career began with classical training on the viola, leading to positions in the Denver Symphony Orchestra by 1907 and the San Francisco Symphony in 1914. During World War I, he conducted a U.S. Navy band, and post-war in 1918, he formed the Paul Whiteman Orchestra in San Francisco, moving to New York City in 1920 where they recorded hits like 'Whispering' and 'Valencia' for Victor, earning him the title 'King of Jazz'.[2][1]

## Fun Facts
- Whiteman commissioned George Gershwin's 'Rhapsody in Blue' in 1924, which premiered with Gershwin at the piano and became the orchestra's signature tune.[2][1]
- Despite being called the 'King of Jazz,' his style was often more commercial and symphonic compared to African-American jazz bands, blending symphonic music with jazz.[1][2]
- He starred in the 1930 Technicolor film 'King of Jazz,' featuring his orchestra and the debut of 'Rhapsody in Blue' on screen.[1]
- Whiteman recorded with African-American artists like Billie Holiday and Paul Robeson, and hired Don Redman as an arranger, countering segregation-era norms.[1]
