## Biography
Supernova is an American punk rock band formed in Costa Mesa, California, in 1989 by bassist/vocalist Art Mitchell (Art Nova), guitarist/vocalist Hayden Thais (Hank), and drummer Dave Collins (Dave Nova). Adopting an outlandish science fiction gimmick where they claimed to be aliens from the planet Cynot 3 fleeing a supernova explosion in their rock 'n' roll-powered spaceship, the band quickly gained traction in the Orange County punk scene with energetic live shows, independent 7" singles, and EPs, earning local and college radio airplay.[1][5] Their breakthrough came in 1994 when the mostly instrumental track 'Chewbacca'—featuring Wookiee growls—was featured on the soundtrack to Kevin Smith's indie film Clerks, exposing them to a wider audience despite Thais departing that year to join Man or Astro-man? and Servotron.[1]

With Jodey Lawrence (Jo Nova) replacing Thais on guitar, Supernova signed to Amphetamine Reptile Records and released their debut album Ages 3 & Up in 1995, followed by extensive touring including the inaugural Vans Warped Tour alongside acts like The Aquabats and Reel Big Fish, and opening for The Buzzcocks, Dick Dale, The Presidents of the United States of America, and The Supersuckers.[1] They issued Rox in 1998 (with another Warped Tour appearance in 1999) and the compilation Pop as a Weapon in 2001, blending trash-pop punk influences akin to the Ramones and Dickies with short, dopey, nonsense-filled songs.[1][5] Lineup changes ensued: Lawrence left in 2008 (humorously cited as becoming a 'full-time Earthling'), replaced briefly by Corey Pollock (Chainsaw) from The Aquabats, who departed in 2010; Lawrence returned.[1] The band sporadically reunited, performing as Gum Fighters in 2012 and releasing the EP No Data in 2014 with demos from a cancelled album.[1]

Supernova's musical style is characterized by high-energy noise rock and skate punk with sci-fi aesthetics, short punk tracks, and humorous lyrics, maintaining a cult following in punk circles. Their legacy endures through Warped Tour participation, film soundtrack placement, and a 2007 Yo Gabba Gabba! performance of 'Up & Down,' bridging punk with children's TV.[1]
