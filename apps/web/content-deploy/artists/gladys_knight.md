## Biography
Gladys Maria Knight was born on May 28, 1944, in Atlanta, Georgia, and began her remarkable musical career at just four years old with a church recital at Mount Mariah Baptist Church.[3] She won the Ted Mack Amateur Hour before age eight with her rendition of a Nat King Cole song.[6] At age eight, she began performing with her siblings—brother Merald "Bubba" Knight and cousins William Guest and Edward Patten—forming a group initially called "the Pips."[2] Throughout the 1950s, the group performed at churches, talent shows, and clubs, opening for popular R&B acts, and signed with Brunswick Records in 1957.[2] After releasing their first album in 1960 when Knight was just 16, the group experienced a temporary halt when Knight left to start a family with musician Jimmy Newman, but she returned to the music business in 1964.[2][5]

Gladys Knight and the Pips achieved their greatest success after signing with Motown Records in 1966, where they recorded iconic hits including "I Heard It Through the Grapevine" (1967) and "Neither One of Us (Wants to Be the First to Say Goodbye)" (1974), the latter winning a Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Performance.[1] Disputes with Motown over song selection and unpaid royalties led the group to leave for Buddah Records in 1973, where they recorded their signature song "Midnight Train to Georgia," which became a number-one hit on both pop and R&B charts and won the Grammy for Best R&B Performance by a Duo, Group, or Chorus in 1974.[1][2] Throughout the mid-1970s and 1980s, Knight and the Pips continued to record successful albums and perform on the casino and supper-club circuit with an evolved easy-listening and adult contemporary sound.[5] The group was inducted into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame in 1989 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996.[5]

In 1987, Knight decided to pursue a solo career, and she and the Pips recorded their final album together, "All Our Love," which included the Grammy-winning single "Love Overboard."[1][2] As a solo artist, Knight recorded the theme song for the James Bond film "Licence to Kill" (1989) and continued to tour and record throughout the 1990s and beyond.[2][3] She won her first solo Grammy in 2000 for her album "At Last" (Best Traditional R&B Vocal Album) and earned another Grammy in 2005 for her gospel duet with Ray Charles, "Heaven Help Us All."[1] Known as the "Empress of Soul," Knight has won seven Grammy Awards total (four as a solo artist and three with the Pips) and recorded two number-one Billboard Hot 100 singles, eleven number-one R&B singles, and six number-one R&B albums.[2] Beyond music, she made her film acting debut in 1976 in "Pipe Dreams," earning a Golden Globe nomination for New Star of the Year, and has appeared in various television shows and films throughout her career.[1][2]
