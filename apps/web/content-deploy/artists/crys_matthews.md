## Biography
Crys Matthews was born and raised in Richlands, a small town in Southeastern North Carolina known as the 'Town of Perfect Water.' A preacher's kid, classically-trained clarinetist, and former drum major, she initially aspired to become a high school band director after starting clarinet in sixth grade. Her path shifted dramatically in college at Appalachian State University, where a serendipitous gig filling in on keys and singing for a band ignited her passion for songwriting and performance; she wrote her first song shortly after, won a campus talent show, taught herself guitar, and began her journey as a folk singer inspired by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s call to be a 'drum major for justice.'

Matthews began performing professionally around 2010, relocating from North Carolina to Herndon, Virginia about ten years ago, and later to Nashville, Tennessee. She blends Americana, folk, blues, bluegrass, country, jazz, and funk into bold performances featuring traditional melodies and honest, original lyrics focused on social justice, hope, and truth—earning comparisons to Woody Guthrie as a troubadour of her generation. Key milestones include winning the 2017 NewSong Music and Performance Competition grand prize at Lincoln Center out of 5,000 entrants, performing at Sundance Film Festival’s ASCAP Music Café, Northeast Regional Folk Alliance, Falcon Ridge Folk Festival, and a riverboat cruise from Paris to Normandy; her 2021 album *Changemakers* saw its title track named the International Folk Music Association's Song of the Year in 2022.

Now a prolific lyricist and composer, Matthews released *Reclamation* recorded at Nashville's Sound Emporium Studios, reclaiming spaces in Country and Americana for Black artists, LGBTQ+ people, and women while embracing her identity as a Black butch lesbian Southerner. Her music galvanizes audiences at festivals, clubs, and coffeehouses nationwide, emphasizing hope amid division, with recent projects like *Battle Hymn for an Army of Lovers* and *The Imagineers* solidifying her as a leading voice in social justice music.
