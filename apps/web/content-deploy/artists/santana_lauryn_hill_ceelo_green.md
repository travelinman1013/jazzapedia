## Biography
Carlos Santana, born on July 20, 1947, in Autlán de Navarro, Mexico, developed his musical foundation there, learning violin and guitar from his father, a mariachi violinist, before moving to Tijuana and later the San Francisco Bay Area in the early 1960s. Influenced by blues artists like B.B. King and T-Bone Walker, he formed the Santana Blues Band in 1966, which evolved into Santana, pioneering a fusion of rock, blues, Latin rhythms, and jazz with percussion-heavy instrumentation including timbales and congas. Their breakthrough came with the self-titled debut album in 1969, featuring the hit 'Evil Ways,' followed by Billboard #1 albums Abraxas and Santana III, and a legendary Woodstock performance that year.[1][2][3][4][6]

Santana's career spanned decades with over 100 million records sold worldwide, marked by a resurgence in 1999 via Supernatural, which sold over 25 million copies and won nine Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year, thanks to collaborations with artists like Rob Thomas ('Smooth') and Lauryn Hill. He earned additional honors such as 10 Grammy Awards total, three Latin Grammys, Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction in 1998, Billboard Century Award in 1996, Lifetime Achievement in 2009, and Kennedy Center Honors in 2013. His style, known for crystalline guitar tone and melodic blues lines over Latin-African rhythms, topped guitarists lists (e.g., #11 by Rolling Stone in 2023).[1][2][3][4][5][6]

Santana's legacy includes activism via the Milagro Foundation for children's health and education, memoirs like The Universal Tone (2014), and consistent innovation across albums like Africa Speaks (2019), influencing global music by bridging Latin and rock genres while achieving Top 10 albums over six decades.[1][2][4]
