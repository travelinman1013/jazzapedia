## Biography
Christian Berishaj, professionally known as JMSN (pronounced "Jameson"), is an American singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and record producer born in 1982 in Dallas, Texas, and raised in Eastpointe, Michigan.[1][3] Of partial Albanian descent, Berishaj demonstrated early musical aptitude, learning guitar and working with Pro Tools as a child, and began recording his own music at age 12.[2][3] His early career saw him navigate multiple projects and label relationships: he formed the band Love Arcade while in high school, which signed to Atlantic Records when he was 18 and released a self-titled album in 2006 on which Berishaj performed every instrument.[1][3] After Love Arcade disbanded, he worked under the moniker Christian TV, signing with Universal Motown Records and licensing songs to films and television, including appearances on *So You Think You Can Dance*.[3][4]

Seeking creative independence and artistic authenticity, Berishaj founded his own label, White Room Records, and adopted the JMSN moniker in 2012, marking a decisive shift toward alternative R&B.[1][2] His debut album *Priscilla* (2012) earned critical acclaim for its darker emotional themes and melancholic production, which critics compared to The Weeknd's aesthetic.[1] He continued building momentum with *Pllaje* (2013), which garnered industry recognition and led to collaborations with artists including J. Cole and The Game.[1] Subsequent albums—*It Is* (2016), *Whatever Makes U Happy* (2017), *Velvet* (2018), *Heals Me* (2021), and *Soft Spot* (2023)—solidified his reputation as an innovative R&B artist known for soulful, emotive vocals and introspective lyrics exploring themes of love, loss, and self-discovery.[1][5]

Based in Los Angeles, JMSN has become an influential figure in contemporary R&B and alternative music, recognized for his ability to blend live instrumentation with electronic production and his work as a producer and songwriter for other artists including Ty Dolla $ign, Ab-Soul, and The Game.[5] His 2023 single "Soft Spot" gained viral attention in late 2024 through social media, with a remix featuring rapper Sada Baby released in December 2024.[1]

## Fun Facts
- Berishaj performed every instrument on the Love Arcade self-titled album at age 19, producing, mixing, and recording the entire project himself before the band was assembled for touring.[3][4]
- His mother cold-called label executives to support his early Love Arcade project, demonstrating early grassroots promotion efforts that eventually led to Atlantic Records signing.[4]
- The viral success of "Soft Spot" in late 2024 came from a snippet of the song's music video shared on social media, leading to a remix with rapper Sada Baby released in December 2024, years after the album's 2023 release.[1]
- JMSN is a multi-disciplinary creative, working not only as a musician but also as a videographer and designer, often handling visual aspects of his projects.[3]
