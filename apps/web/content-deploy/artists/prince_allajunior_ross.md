## Biography
Prince Alla, born Keith Lorenzo Blake on May 10, 1950, in St. Elizabeth, Jamaica, is a pioneering roots reggae singer who helped establish the foundation for roots reggae music globally. Raised in Greenwich Town, Kingston, Blake began his musical career in the late 1960s as a member of the vocal group The Leaders alongside Milton Henry and Roy "Soft" Palmer, recording rocksteady tracks for producer Joe Gibbs at Federal Recording Company. His early career was interrupted when he embraced the Rastafari movement deeply, spending significant time at Prince Emmanuel Edwards' Bobo Hill camp in Bull Bay during the late 1960s and early 1970s, where he lived according to strict Rastafarian principles and withdrew from the music industry.

Prince Alla re-emerged into the music scene in the mid-1970s as a committed roots reggae artist, recording some of his most influential and spiritually grounded works with producer Bertram Brown's Freedom Sounds label and Tappa Zukie's Stars label. His classic recordings from this period—including "Sun Is Shining," "Bucket Bottom," "Lot's Wife," and "Stone" (mixed by the legendary King Tubby)—became regarded as roots reggae standards, characterized by their incorporation of Old Testament biblical narratives placed within contexts of social injustice in Jamaica and the world. Dubbed "The Gentle Giant" for his warm and irrepressible character, Prince Alla maintained a humble lifestyle in West Kingston while continuing to record and perform internationally throughout subsequent decades.

In the early 2000s, Prince Alla experienced a significant resurgence in popularity as new generations of reggae enthusiasts discovered his music through reissued classic albums. He became recognized as a pioneering figure in roots reggae, continuing to tour internationally at festivals and concerts while recording for UK and European dub-reggae producers who appreciated his strictly roots and culture approach. His career, spanning from the late 1960s to the present, demonstrates his enduring commitment to authentic roots reggae music and Rastafarian spirituality.
