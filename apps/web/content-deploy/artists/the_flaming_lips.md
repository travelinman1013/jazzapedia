## Biography
The Flaming Lips formed in Oklahoma City in 1983 when founder and guitarist Wayne Coyne enlisted his vocalist brother Mark and bassist Michael Ivins to start a band.[2] The group's name has been attributed to various origins, including a porn film, an obscure drug reference, or a dream in which a fiery Virgin Mary plants a kiss on Wayne in the backseat of his car.[2] After Mark Coyne departed to get married, Wayne assumed full control as lead guitarist, primary singer, and songwriter.[2] Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, the band recorded several albums and EPs for Restless Records, progressing through numerous lineup changes while developing their distinctive neo-psychedelic sound.[3]

The Flaming Lips achieved their breakthrough in 1994 with the hit single "She Don't Use Jelly," which reached #9 on the Billboard Alternative charts and #55 on the Billboard Hot 100.[3] Following this success, they released critically acclaimed albums including 1995's *Clouds Taste Metallic*, 1999's *The Soft Bulletin*, and 2002's *Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots*, their highest-selling and most critically acclaimed record, which reached Gold certification in Australia and the United States and Platinum in the United Kingdom.[1][3] The album track *Approaching Pavonis Mons by Balloon (Utopia Planitia)* earned the band their first Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance.[1]

Led by flamboyant frontman Wayne Coyne, the Flaming Lips have drawn from the performance tropes of stadium rock and opera, incorporating lush multi-layered song arrangements of funk and psych-rock with themes of science fiction, space, and romance.[5] Over four decades, Wayne Coyne has remained the only original band member, while the band has released sixteen studio albums, eighteen extended plays, ten compilation albums, and four visual albums, establishing themselves as cross-genre touring titans known for their immersive and vibrant live shows.[1][3][4]

## Fun Facts
- According to one origin story, Wayne Coyne allegedly stole a collection of musical instruments from an area church hall to start the band.[2]
- The band made its live debut at a local transvestite club in Oklahoma City.[2]
- Wayne Coyne has described being inspired by a Tom Petty documentary called 'Runnin' Down A Dream,' which sparked the idea of imagining what would have happened if Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers had been influenced by his older brothers' druggie friends instead of becoming the iconic band they are.[4]
- Despite leading a band known for offering the most immersive stage show in rock music, Wayne Coyne and Steven Drozd are natural introverts.[4]
