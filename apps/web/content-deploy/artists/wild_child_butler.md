## Biography
George "Wild Child" Butler (October 1, 1936 – March 1, 2005) was an American blues harmonica player and vocalist born in Autaugaville, Alabama. He earned his nickname "Wild Child" from his mischievous childhood behavior—crawling across floors and pulling at the skirts of women guests at family parties. Butler displayed musical talent from an early age, singing at family gatherings when he was just five years old. At age 12, he fashioned a makeshift harmonica from a Prince Albert tobacco can filled with rocks, teaching himself to play the instrument upside-down—a technique he maintained throughout his entire career. Following the Great Migration, Butler moved to Chicago in the mid-1950s, where he became immersed in the city's thriving blues scene and performed alongside legendary musicians including John Lee Hooker and Sonny Boy Williamson II.

Butler's recording career began in 1963 with his first recordings "Aching All Over" and "Down In The Chili" for Sharp Records, a small Montgomery-based label. He subsequently recorded for Jewel Records (20 tracks) and Chess Studios, the legendary Chicago recording house. Throughout the late 1960s and beyond, Butler performed frequently in the corridor between Houston, Texas, and New Orleans, Louisiana, occasionally collaborating with blues legend Sam "Lightnin'" Hopkins. His signature song "Gravy Child" came from his Mercury Records album *Keep On Doing What You're Doing*. Notable later releases included *Funky Butt Lover* (1977, TK Records), *Lickin' Gravy* (1989, MC Records), *These Old Men Blues* (1991, Bullseye Blues), *Stranger* (1994, Bullseye Blues), and *Sho' 'Nuff* (2001, APO Records).

Butler characterized his personal style as "the swamp sound," distinguished by his gutsy baritone growl and rootsy blues approach that bridged Delta blues traditions with urban electric blues. He resettled in Windsor, Ontario, Canada in 1981 with his wife Elaine, where he maintained an active performing schedule both domestically and internationally until his death from a pulmonary embolism on March 1, 2005. Though perhaps less famous than some contemporaries, Butler remained a true believer in traditional blues throughout his life, distinguishing himself as an artist while placing his music within the larger continuum of blues history.

## Fun Facts
- Butler fashioned his first harmonica from a Prince Albert tobacco can filled with rocks, creating holes in the back to mimic a real harmonica. He played the harmonica upside-down for his entire career as a result of this self-taught method.
- His nickname "Wild Child" originated from his mischievous childhood habit of crawling across floors and pulling at the skirts of women guests at family parties—a behavior that stuck with him throughout his life.
- Butler claimed he never received payment for some of his recording arrangements, despite contributing to multiple sessions and releases across various labels including Chess Studios.
- When asked in a 2001 interview whether he would modify his classic sound for commercial success, Butler quickly rebuked the notion, remaining committed to the "rootsy" blues that was his trademark until his death.
