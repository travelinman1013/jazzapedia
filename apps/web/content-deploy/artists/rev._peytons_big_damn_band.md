## Biography
Josh 'Reverend' Peyton, the frontman of Reverend Peyton's Big Damn Band, grew up in rural Brown County, Southern Indiana, where he developed an early passion for rootsy country blues, ragtime, folk, and traditional styles. He began playing music at age 12, writing stories from age three and songs by 13, quickly becoming a lead guitarist in local bands despite a year-and-a-half hand injury around 18-19 that temporarily halted his playing. Inspired by acoustic blues icons like Charlie Patton, Blind Willie Johnson, Bukka White, and Furry Lewis, Peyton and his band made pilgrimages to Clarksdale, Mississippi, to study under masters such as T-Model Ford, Robert Belfour, and David 'Honeyboy' Edwards.[1][2][3]

Formed around 2004, the band—initially featuring Peyton on bottleneck slide guitar (including a 1935 model), his wife 'Washboard Breezy' on washboard, and cousin Aaron 'Cuz' Persinger on drums and bucket—evolved into a high-energy trio known for its unique mix of bluegrass, roots rock, country blues, and Americana. Renowned as road warriors, they performed over 200-300 shows annually since 2006 across 38 countries and 48 states, releasing albums like Big Damn Nation, The Gospel Album, The Whole Fam Damnily, The Wages, Between the Ditches, So Delicious, Peyton on Patton, and the #1 Billboard Blues chart-topper Dance Songs For Hard Times (produced by Grammy winner Vance Powell). Their handmade, front-porch blues style, emphasizing melody, true stories, and showmanship, earned features in Rolling Stone, Living Blues, Vintage Guitar, three Blues Music Award nominations, and recognition as one of Indiana's top 25 musicians.[2][3][4][6]

The band's relentless touring and authentic evangelism for country blues have cemented their legacy as 'the greatest front-porch blues band in the world' and America's foremost country blues outfit, with Peyton hailed as the premier finger-picker today. Albums like The Front Porch Sessions showcase his guitar mastery and vivid songwriting, aiming for timeless, hand-made American music.[2][3]
