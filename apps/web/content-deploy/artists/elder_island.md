## Biography
Elder Island is a British electronic music trio formed in Bristol, consisting of vocalist and cellist Katy Sargent, bassist and beat engineer Luke Thornton, and guitarist and synth virtuoso David Havard. The members met during their university studies in fine art, photography, and graphic design, with Luke and David having known each other since childhood, starting music together at age 16. They began making music as a hobby in shared houses, influenced by Bristol's vibrant genre-splicing scene, initially experimenting with 'experimental folk music' using basic equipment like a cheap microphone, GarageBand, a second-hand cello, and random instruments before incorporating electronic elements.

Formed around 2014 as an experiment, the band released their eponymous debut EP that year, featuring ambient soundscapes of field recordings, loops, and percussive elements. Their 2016 EP 'Seeds In Sand' marked a shift to a more cohesive dance-influenced sound. The debut album 'The Omnitone Collection' arrived in 2019 as an integrated concept album, blending electronica, house, pop, neo-soul, poetic lyricism, and unfamiliar instruments over synth-heavy beats. They have toured extensively, selling out shows in venues like New York's Bowery Ballroom, LA's El Rey Theater, London's Roundhouse and Printworks, and performing at festivals like Lightning In A Bottle, with continued activity post-pandemic including UK and North American tours.

Elder Island's style defies genre, prioritizing organic collaboration, improvisation, and themes drawn from memory, myth, biology, news, and television, refined through shared artistic backgrounds. Their DIY ethos and close friendship maintain a focus on fun and experimentation, resulting in shapeshifting songs where textures and crypticism are central.
