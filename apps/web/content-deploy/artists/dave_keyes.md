## Biography
Dave Keyes is a native New Yorker and accomplished keyboardist, singer, and songwriter who has been a prominent figure in the blues and American roots music scenes for over 40 years.[1][2] Beginning his musical journey in the 5th grade when he first learned to improvise on a 12-bar blues,[2] Keyes developed a deep connection to blues music that would define his career. He describes the blues as the foundation of all music, comparing it to the roots of a tree from which all other genres branch off.[2] Throughout his extensive career, Keyes has worked both as a solo artist and bandleader with his Dave Keyes Band, earning multiple Blues Music Award nominations and winning the Blues Foundation's International Blues Challenge.[1][2]

Keyes' musical style encompasses a wide range of influences spanning blues, boogie, gospel, rock and roll, and soul.[1][2] His songbook reflects diverse inspirations from Ray Charles to Leon Russell, and his original compositions range from New Orleans second-line funk to slow sensual blues and swaggering shuffles.[1][4] Beyond his work as a performer and recording artist with seven albums to his name,[2] Keyes has maintained a significant presence in Broadway and television, serving as conductor for the six-year Broadway run of the Grammy-winning musical "Smokey Joe's Cafe" and music directing productions including "Rock and Roll Man" based on the life of DJ Alan Freed.[1]

Keyes' legacy is defined by his versatility and longevity as both a bandleader and sideman, having collaborated with an impressive roster of blues, roots, and rock and roll legends. His work has taken him across the globe, with festival appearances in the United States and Europe, including multiple performances at France's prestigious Cognac Blues Festival and annual appearances at Lugano, Switzerland's Blues to Bop Festival.[1] His commitment to staying true to his artistic voice while respecting the blues tradition has made him a respected figure in the contemporary blues and roots music community.[2]
