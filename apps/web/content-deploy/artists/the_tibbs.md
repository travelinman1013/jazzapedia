## Biography
The Tibbs is an eight-piece retro soul and funk band formed in 2012 in Amsterdam, Netherlands, founded by enthusiasts of northern soul and funk inspired by the golden age of soul music. Fronted by the powerful vocalist Elsa Bekman, known for her raw, gritty, and unique vocals, the group initially gained traction by covering lesser-known soul classics paired with rare beat instrumentals. Reared on a diet of rhythm & blues, funk, jazz, pop, and ska, they blend garage soul influences traceable to Detroit and Philly sounds, evolving from covers to their own original soulful creations as their popularity grew.

Based around Amsterdam, The Tibbs quickly expanded their repertoire, establishing themselves as a super tight soul revue. Their deep retro soul style reflects a dedication to vintage influences while delivering high-energy performances. Active since the 2010s, they have built a following through their distinctive sound and Bekman's commanding presence, positioning them as a standout in the modern retro soul scene.
