## Biography
Marisa de Azevedo Monte, born July 1, 1967, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, grew up immersed in the sounds of samba through the Portela samba school, which her father helped manage, while also pursuing rigorous classical training in opera.[3][4][5] As a teenager she studied lyric singing and, at 19, moved to Italy (Rome) to further her bel canto and operatic studies, but soon gravitated toward popular music, performing Brazilian and international repertoires in clubs and theaters.[1][3] There she met producer and journalist Nelson Motta, who encouraged her to return to Brazil and helped organize her early theatrical-style shows, giving her a substantial live following even before she released her first album.[1][3]

Her debut, the live album “MM” (1989), captured that eclectic stage concept and became a sensation in Brazil, propelled by the hit “Bem Que Se Quis” and selling around half a million copies.[2][3] Monte consolidated her position with her first studio album “Mais” (1991), produced by Arto Lindsay in New York and featuring collaborators such as Arnaldo Antunes, Nando Reis, Ryuichi Sakamoto, Bernie Worrell, Naná Vasconcelos, and John Zorn, blending MPB with art‑pop, rock, and avant‑garde textures.[1][3] Through albums like “Verde, Anil, Amarelo, Cor‑de‑Rosa e Carvão” (1994), “Barulhinho Bom” (1997) and “Memórias, Crônicas e Declarações de Amor” (2000), she became one of the most acclaimed Brazilian vocalists of the 1990s, noted for her clear, technically refined yet emotionally intimate voice and her role not only as singer, but also as songwriter, producer, and curator of Brazilian musical heritage.[1][3]

Monte’s style is typically categorized as MPB, but her work continuously folds in samba, bossa nova, pop, rock, and experimental influences, making genre labels feel limited.[2][3] In the 2000s she founded her own label Phonomotor, released the critically praised paired albums “Universo ao Meu Redor” (a samba‑focused project) and “Infinito Particular” (a more personal, collaborative set) in 2006, and gained further international recognition with multiple Latin Grammy nominations and wins.[3] Her collaboration with Arnaldo Antunes and Carlinhos Brown as the trio Tribalistas yielded the massively successful album “Tribalistas” (2002), with hits such as “Já Sei Namorar” and “Velha Infância” that expanded her audience in Europe and beyond.[1][2][3] Over more than three decades she has become a central figure in contemporary Brazilian music, often cited among the greatest Brazilian artists of her generation, and in 2021 she became the first Brazilian woman to receive the Tenco Award for lifetime achievement in songwriting, underscoring her lasting artistic legacy.[2][7]

## Fun Facts
- Before becoming a pop icon, Marisa Monte seriously intended to be an opera singer, studying lyric singing from her teens and moving to Rome at 19 specifically to pursue an operatic career.[1][3]
- Her breakthrough debut album, “MM”, was not a conventional studio album but a live recording of a theatrical concert that mixed classic Brazilian songs, international pop, and visual staging, and it became a massive hit in Brazil.[1][3]
- Monte co‑founded her own label, Phonomotor Records, giving her unusual artistic and business control for a Brazilian pop artist and releasing major works like “Memórias, Crônicas e Declarações de Amor” (2000) and “Tribalistas” (2002) through it.[3]
- In 2021 she became the first Brazilian woman to receive the prestigious Tenco Award for lifetime achievement in songwriting, highlighting her stature not just as a vocalist but as a composer of international renown.[7]
