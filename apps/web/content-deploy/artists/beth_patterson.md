## Biography
Beth Waggoner Patterson, born in Lafayette, Louisiana, began her musical career in her teens as a classical oboist, Cajun bass player, and even heavy metal bassist, while earning her first professional income in high school with a local symphony and Cajun band. She studied traditional Irish music and ethnomusicology at University College Cork in Ireland, experimenting with musical fusions, and later completed a bachelor's degree in Music Therapy from Loyola University New Orleans. Influenced by progressive rock band Rush, she blends traditional Irish, Celtic, and folk ballads with Cajun, world-beat, progressive rock, and her own songwriting, creating a unique style she dubs 'WAP' (Songwriter/World/Acoustic/Progressive).[1][2][4][6]

Patterson founded the ensemble Poor Clares, debuting at the 2003 New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival with albums like *Change of Habit* and *Songs for Midwinter*. She released solo albums on Little Blue Men Records, including *Hybrid Vigor* (Celtic fusion with swing and Louisiana elements), *Take Some Fire* (world-beat and rock-influenced), *Caught in the Act* (2005 live bouzouki album), and the Grammy-nominated *On Better Paths* (2009) for Best Contemporary Folk Album. Post-Hurricane Katrina, which closed her regular venue O'Flaherty's Irish Pub, she continued performing at Kerry Irish Pub and internationally in 20 countries, appearing on over 200 recordings, including soundtracks like *The One-Eyed King* and *Extract*.[1][3][4][5]

Based in New Orleans, Patterson performs solo, as 'Bad Beth & Beyond' (2013-2018 bawdy alter ego), duo ZoüKeys with husband Josh Paxton (since 2017), Round Pegs with Patrick O'Flaherty, and New Orleans Steamcog Orchestra as 'B.P. Hatbox'. Her primary instrument is the Irish bouzouki (8- and 10-string), alongside bass guitar and English horn, showcasing her versatility across genres and her razor wit in performances.[1][2][6]
