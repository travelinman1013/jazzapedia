## Biography
Hypnotic Brass Ensemble are eight brothers from the south side of Chicago who emerged from an extraordinary musical family legacy.[1][2] Their father, Kelan Phil Cohran, was a multi-instrumentalist and bandleader with deep roots in Mississippi and a seminal role with Sun Ra in Chicago during the 1950s.[2][3] Growing up, the brothers were immersed in music from an early age—they were awakened at 6 a.m. for several hours of practice before school and became central members of their father's Youth Ensemble, performing in the Sun Ark, a warehouse space behind the family home.[2] Simultaneously, they developed a parallel passion for hip-hop, secretly listening to N.W.A, Public Enemy, Ice Cube, and Eazy-E under the covers, which they would later blend with their jazz heritage.

By the late 1990s, with all brothers out of school, they began busking on the streets of Chicago, combining their jazz roots with modern hip-hop sensibilities to create their distinctive sound.[1][2] The band's name originated from an incident on the Chicago El train platform, when a man in a suit became so captivated by their performance that he missed multiple trains before telling them, "You guys just hypnotized me."[2] The group eventually relocated to New York City, where they played relentlessly and gained recognition through performances with artists like Mos Def and Erykah Badu.[1][2] Since then, they have achieved international acclaim, appearing on Britain's Later with Jools Holland and collaborating on Gorillaz albums, establishing themselves as one of the most innovative and individual brass ensembles in contemporary music.[1][2]

## Fun Facts
- The band's name originated from a spontaneous moment on the Chicago El train platform when a stranger became so mesmerized by their street performance that he missed multiple trains before approaching them to say, 'You guys just hypnotized me.'[2]
- As children, the brothers would sneak under their covers at night to listen to N.W.A and Public Enemy while simultaneously being trained in their father's jazz and cosmic music traditions during early morning practice sessions, creating the unique fusion that defines their sound.[2]
- Before forming Hypnotic Brass Ensemble, the brothers created earlier groups including 'Gangsters with a Curfew' (GWC) and 'Wolf Pak' (Wolves on the Lookout for Pigs and Klansmen), where they would hum harmonies and pass around a microphone to rap.[2]
- The band's father, Phil Cohran, has direct historical connections to both 1920s Mississippi blues heritage and Sun Ra's experimental Arkestra movement in 1950s Chicago, making the family a living bridge between multiple eras of African American musical innovation.[2][3]
