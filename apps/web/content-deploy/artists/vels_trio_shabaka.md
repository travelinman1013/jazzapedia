## Biography
Shabaka Hutchings, born in London in 1984, spent much of his childhood in Barbados from age six and returned to England as a teenager, initially living in Birmingham before moving to London. At 19, he enrolled at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, earning a classical clarinet degree, and joined the Tomorrow's Warriors program, where he connected with key figures in London's jazz scene.[1][3][4] His early career embraced free improvisation at venues like Café Oto, collaborating with peers and veterans, before leading influential ensembles that defined the 2010s UK jazz renaissance.

Hutchings rose to prominence as a saxophonist and bandleader with Sons of Kemet (until 2022), The Comet Is Coming (as King Shabaka), and Shabaka and the Ancestors, blending nu jazz, indie jazz, jazz fusion, and experimental jazz with Afro-Caribbean rhythms, electronic elements, and global influences from South African jazz to Ethiojazz.[1][2][3][4] Key releases include *Wisdom of Elders* (2016), *Channel the Spirits* (2016, Mercury Prize nominee), *Afrikan Culture* EP (2022), and his solo debut *Perceive Its Beauty, Acknowledge Its Grace* (2024) on Impulse!. In 2023, he announced a hiatus from saxophone due to physical strain, shifting to flutes like shakuhachi and bansuri, inspired by practices such as long-tone exercises.[1][2]

His legacy includes awards like the 2013 MOBO for Sons of Kemet, 2014 Paul Hamlyn Composer Award, and Jazz FM Innovation honors, positioning him as a pioneer of London's jazz scene, influencing a new generation while curating projects like the 2018 Brownswood compilation.[1][3]
