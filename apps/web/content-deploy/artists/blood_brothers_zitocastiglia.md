## Biography
Blood Brothers is a blues rock supergroup formed by two acclaimed guitarists and vocalists, Mike Zito and Albert Castiglia, who combined their respective solo careers and bands to create a collaborative project.[1] Mike Zito, a nine-time Blues Music Award winner and St. Louis native based in Beaumont, Texas, is a self-taught guitarist who built his reputation through solo work and his involvement with the all-star band Royal Southern Brotherhood (formed in 2011 with Cyril Neville and Devon Allman).[2][5] Albert Castiglia, a five-time Blues Music Award winner born in New York City but Miami-raised, earned his credentials by backing legendary Chicago blues musician Junior Wells in the late 1990s, gaining direct exposure to the electric blues tradition that shaped his playing style.[2][3] Together, Zito and Castiglia represent over 45 years of combined experience in the blues and roots music genres, with each artist having won Blues Music Awards in the Blues Rock Artist of the Year category and for Blues Rock Album of the Year in their individual careers.[1]

The Blood Brothers project officially launched in 2023 with their debut studio album, produced by Joe Bonamassa and Josh Smith and recorded at Dockside Studio in Maurice, Louisiana.[1][6] The album featured contributions from both artists' powerhouse bands, including Matt Johnson and Ephraim Lowell on drums, Doug Byrkit on bass, Lewis Stephens on piano and organ, and guest appearances from Josh Smith on guitar and Joe Bonamassa on the track "A Thousand Heartaches."[1] In November 2023, they released a live recording, Blood Brothers: Live in Canada, capturing the energy of their recent tour.[2] Their 2024 debut studio album won the Blues Music Award for Blues Rock Album of the Year, cementing their status as a significant force in contemporary blues rock.[1] The project represents a deep musical partnership between two artists who serve as each other's creative confidantes, combining their songwriting talents and high-energy performances to create what producers describe as "a total listening experience greater than the sum of its parts."[1][6]

## Fun Facts
- Mike Zito wrote the song "In My Soul" during a deeply personal period in summer 2022 when his wife Laura was diagnosed with cancer; Albert Castiglia suggested he write about his feelings, and this was the only song that emerged from that emotional time, created spontaneously without overthinking or analysis.[1]
- Albert Castiglia's musical lineage traces back to the pioneering Chicago blues era through Junior Wells, who himself took over for Little Walter in Muddy Waters' band during the 1950s, giving Castiglia a direct connection to one of the most influential figures in electric blues history.[2]
- The Blood Brothers project brought together two separate powerhouse bands from Zito and Castiglia's solo careers, featuring dual drummers (Matt Johnson and Ephraim Lowell) to create a fuller, more dynamic sound than either artist typically employed in their individual work.[1]
- Mike Zito's first internationally distributed album "Today" was released in 2008, marking the beginning of his rise to prominence, while his 2024 solo album "Life Is Hard" won a Blues Music Award for Blues Rock Album of the Year, demonstrating his continued relevance and productivity alongside the Blood Brothers project.[5]
