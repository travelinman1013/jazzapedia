## Biography
Manuel Moreno Maya, known as **El Pele**, was born on January 17, 1954, in the San Pedro district of Córdoba, Spain. A flamenco singer renowned for his sharp intuition and spontaneous, pure singing style, he emerged as a revelation at age 15 by winning the Cayetano Muriel Award in Cabra. His early career was shaped by the presence of flamenco legends like Caracol, Marchena, and Pastora Pavón, whose influences are evident in his non-orthodox yet deeply rooted approach to cante, blending traditional forms such as seguirillas, tangos, bulerías, and alegrías with personal innovation.[1][2][3]

El Pele's career solidified with major accolades, including La Serneta por solea and Pastora Pavón por bulerías at the 1983 National Flamenco Art Competition in Córdoba, followed by the Giraldillo al Momento Mágico (2012), Bandera de Andalucía (2013), Gold Medal of Merit in Fine Arts (2019), and Maestría al Cante (2021). His expressive, powerful voice—described as a 'flamenco animal in its purest state'—has led to collaborations with global icons like David Bowie and Prince, and a transformative partnership with guitarist Vicente Amigo, resulting in albums like Canto (2003). Shows like Puro y Salvaje showcase his quest for new flamenco expressions grounded in jondo roots.[2][6][7]

El Pele's legacy endures as a unique cantaor capable of improvisation that drives audiences wild, containing what some call the 'global memory of flamenco.' His recordings, from early works like Juan Moreno Maya “El Pele” con la Guitarra de “Merengue” (1974) to later ones like La fuente de lo jondo (1986), affirm his mastery across flamenco palos, earning praise for raw intensity and emotional depth.[1][3][4]
