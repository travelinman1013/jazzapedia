## Biography
Roger Dean Miller Sr. was born on January 2, 1936, in Fort Worth, Texas, and moved very early to Erick, Oklahoma, to live with his aunt and uncle after his father died and his mother could no longer care for him. Growing up during the Great Depression, he developed an early interest in music, learning fiddle, guitar, and drums. After serving in the U.S. Army in the mid-1950s, Miller arrived in Nashville in 1957, initially working odd jobs and playing in bands. He joined Ray Price's Cherokee Cowboys as a backup singer and drummer, and began writing songs, scoring early successes like 'Invitation to the Blues' for Ray Price and 'Billy Bayou' for Jim Reeves.[1][3][4][5]

Miller's recording career took off after signing with Smash Records in 1964, when he released the novelty hits 'Dang Me'—written in just four minutes—and 'Chug-a-Lug,' both topping country charts and crossing over to pop. His signature song 'King of the Road' followed in 1965, reaching No. 1 on country charts and No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100, earning multiple Grammys and solidifying his honky-tonk-influenced style blending witty, humorous lyrics with country and pop appeal. Known for his 'goofy persona' and novelty songs, he won 11 Grammy Awards, appeared on TV shows like The Jimmy Dean Show, and briefly hosted his own NBC variety series in 1966. Despite personal struggles including a party lifestyle and divorces, he continued recording into the 1990s, charting 'Old Friends' with Ray Price and Willie Nelson in 1982.[1][2][4]

Miller died of lung cancer on October 25, 1992, and was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1995 and the Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame in 2005. His legacy endures through covers like Alan Jackson's 'Tall, Tall Trees' and Brooks & Dunn's 'Husbands and Wives,' both No. 1 country hits in the 1990s, and his influence on country songwriting and humor.[1][5]
