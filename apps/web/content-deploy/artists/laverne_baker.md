## Biography
LaVern Baker, born Delores LaVern Evans (also known as Delores LaVern Baker) on November 11, 1929, in Chicago, Illinois, began her musical journey singing in a Baptist church choir before transitioning to secular performances in local clubs during the mid-1940s while still underage. She started recording under pseudonyms like Little Miss Sharecropper and Bea Baker, inspired by performers such as Minnie Hicks (Cornshucks), and by 1953 had adopted the name LaVern Baker, signing with Atlantic Records. Her exuberant vocal style blended rhythm and blues, blues, jazz, and emerging rock and roll elements, producing mid-1950s hits like 'Tweedlee Dee,' 'Jim Dandy,' and later ballads such as 'I Cried a Tear' in 1958, which showcased her dramatic expression and rhythmic energy.

Baker achieved significant crossover success to white audiences in rock and roll's early days, with 15 R&B hits from 1955 to 1965, though her career faced setbacks from white cover versions, including Georgia Gibbs' chart-topping take on 'Tweedlee Dee,' prompting unsuccessful legal and congressional efforts. In the late 1960s, illness during a Vietnam USO tour led her to recover at Subic Bay Naval Base in the Philippines, where she served as entertainment director at the Marine Corps NCO club for over 22 years. She staged a triumphant return in 1988 at Atlantic's 40th-anniversary concert, contributed to film soundtracks like *Shag*, *Dick Tracy*, and *A Rage in Harlem*, and starred in the Broadway musical *Black and Blue* in 1990, replacing Ruth Brown, continuing to perform despite diabetes until her death on March 10, 1997, in New York.

Her legacy endures as a pioneering female R&B artist who bridged jump blues, boogie-woogie, and rock and roll, influencing the genre's evolution with her powerful belt, sultry edge, and versatility across novelty songs and jazz interpretations like *LaVern Baker Sings Bessie Smith* (1958).
