## Biography
Pat Boone, born Charles Eugene Patrick Boone on June 1, 1934, in Jacksonville, Florida, moved to Nashville, Tennessee, at age two, where he was raised in a musical family as a descendant of frontier hero Daniel Boone. He began performing publicly from age 10, singing in church, at school events, and local talent shows, influenced by pop crooners like Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby, Perry Como, and Nat King Cole. A high school standout at David Lipscomb High School, he hosted a teen talent show, was student body president, and eloped at 19 with Shirley Foley, daughter of country star Red Foley. After early recordings with Republic Records and wins on TV shows like Ted Mack's Original Amateur Hour and Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts, he signed with Dot Records in 1955, launching his career with clean-cut covers of R&B hits like 'Ain't That a Shame' (Fats Domino) and 'Tutti Frutti' (Little Richard), selling millions and becoming a teen idol known as 'Mr. Nice Guy.'

Boone's musical style blended pop standards, rock 'n' roll covers adapted for white audiences, and later gospel and country, while he balanced stardom with education, graduating magna cum laude from Columbia University in 1958 with a degree in English and speech. He hosted The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom on ABC (1957-1960), starred in over a dozen films for 20th Century Fox, authored best-selling self-help books like Twixt Twelve and Twenty, and founded Lamb & Lion Records in the 1970s, featuring family acts and Christian artists. His career evolved into gospel music, motivational speaking, radio hosting, and philanthropy, maintaining relevance into his 80s via his own Gold Label for veteran artists.

Boone's legacy endures as one of the top-selling artists of the 1950s-1960s, with 38 Top 10 hits, a symbol of wholesome entertainment who bridged R&B to mainstream pop, influenced family-oriented music, and remained active in faith-based causes, politics, and entertainment ownership.
