## Biography
Big Lucky is a Los Angeles-based swing and jazz band fronted by vocalist Val Peterson and led by composer, arranger, and saxophonist Paul Frederick. The band was formed when Peterson and Frederick met at a vintage swing night in Hollywood, where Frederick's clarinet playing complemented Peterson's torch singing style. Inspired by classic songwriters and performers including Cole Porter, Irving Berlin, Ella Fitzgerald, and Artie Shaw, they bonded instantly and set out to evangelize the greatest music of the past while infusing it with their own hipster chic aesthetic. The band performs nostalgic music spanning from the 1920s to the 1960s, blending retro-lounge swing with glamorous arrangements and original compositions featuring jazz, Latin, and European influences.
