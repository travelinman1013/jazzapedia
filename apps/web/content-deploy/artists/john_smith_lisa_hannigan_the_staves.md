## Biography
John Smith is an English singer-songwriter and acoustic guitarist born in Essex and raised on the Devon seaside. He began his music career playing in clubs around Liverpool, developing his intimate songwriting style characterized by a 'honey-on-gravel' voice that conveys themes of beauty, melancholy, hope, forgiveness, retribution, and sadness. His influences include folk legends Richard Thompson, John Martyn, Eric Clapton, Maria Callas, and Nick Drake, shaping his pioneering guitar playing and British folk roots with Americana elements.[1][5][6]

Smith's career advanced through extensive international touring and session work, supporting and collaborating with artists like John Martyn, Joan Baez, David Gray, Tom Jones, Jackson Browne, Patty Griffin, Sarah Jarosz, the Milk Carton Kids, Lianne La Havas, Joe Henry, and Lisa Hannigan, for whom he frequently played guitar. His sixth album, *The Fray* (2021), recorded at Peter Gabriel’s Real World Studios and co-produced with Sam Lakeman, featured remote vocal contributions from Lisa Hannigan, Sarah Jarosz, Bill Frisell, the Milk Carton Kids, Courtney Hartman, and Jessica Staveley-Taylor of the Staves during the pandemic. Later releases like *Gatherings* (2025) revisited early songs with guests including Lisa Hannigan, The Staves, Siobhan Miller, and Dan Mangan, solidifying his status in the UK contemporary folk scene.[1][2][3][4][5]

Known for over 80 million Spotify streams and masterful live performances, Smith's legacy lies in his honest, story-driven songs that blend folk traditions with innovative production, earning acclaim as one of the elite in modern British folk music.[1][3][4]
