## Biography
Christopher Brian Bridges, known professionally as Ludacris, was born on September 11, 1977, in Champaign, Illinois, as the only child of college students Roberta Shields and Wayne Brian Bridges. His parents divorced when he was young, and at around age 12, he moved to Atlanta, Georgia, with his mother, where he remained close to both parents despite the split. Starting to rap at age nine, he joined a childhood group called the Loudmouth Hooligans before the move. Facing financial struggles as a teenager, Ludacris credits his mother's strict discipline for keeping him focused on school; he graduated from Banneker High School in 1995 and briefly studied music management at Georgia State University from 1998 to 1999.[1][2][3][5][7]

Ludacris began his career as a DJ at Atlanta's Hot 97.5 (later Hot 107.9) under the name DJ Chris Lova Lova, which led to connections in the hip-hop scene. His debut came in 1998 with a guest verse on Timbaland's 'Phat Rabbit' from *Tim’s Bio: Life from Da Bassment*. He independently released *Incognegro* in 2000 on his Disturbing tha Peace label, produced by Jermaine Dupri, Bangladesh, and Organized Noize. Breakthrough success arrived with his major-label debut *Back for the First Time* (2000), featuring hits like 'Southern Hospitality' and 'What's Your Fantasy,' which went triple platinum and established his **Dirty South** style—characterized by exuberant, profanity-laden rap reflecting southern hip-hop's lavish persona.[1][2][3][5]

A pioneer of **southern hip hop**, Ludacris's magnetic, larger-than-life delivery propelled albums like *Chicken-n-Beer* (2003), despite controversies over explicit content. He expanded into acting, notably as Tej Parker in the *Fast and the Furious* franchise, and founded the Ludacris Foundation (LudaCares) in 2001 to support urban youth. His legacy endures as a key figure in popularizing Dirty South rap, blending rapid flows, humor, and Atlanta's sound for mainstream appeal.[1][2][5]
