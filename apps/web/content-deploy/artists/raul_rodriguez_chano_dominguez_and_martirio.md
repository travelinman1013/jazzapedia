## Biography
Raúl Rodríguez Quiñones, born in Sevilla, Spain in 1974, is a musician, cultural anthropologist, producer, composer, and guitarist renowned for creating the 'Tres Flamenco,' a hybrid instrument blending the Cuban tres with flamenco guitar traditions. Son of the acclaimed Spanish singer Martirio, he grew up immersed in Seville's musical counterculture of the 1970s and 1980s, starting as a drummer and electric guitarist in rock and blues bands like Los Innombrables (1989-1992) in Huelva. He trained in flamenco guitar, specializing in the Toque de Morón style, and earned degrees in Geography and History and Cultural Anthropology to deepen his understanding of popular music roots, particularly the cultural exchanges between Andalusia, Latin America, and Africa.[1][2]

Rodríguez launched his professional career in 1992 as an accompanist for artists including his mother Martirio, Kiko Veneno, Javier Ruibal, and Juan Perro (Santiago Auserón). He formed his first band, Caraoscura, with José Loreto 'Charamusco' in 1995, releasing 'Qué es lo que quieres de mí' (RCA, 1994), produced by Kiko Veneno and Jo Dworniak, and touring Spain. In 2003, he founded Son de la Frontera, pioneering the integration of the Cuban tres into flamenco through reinterpretations of Diego del Gastor's music, with bandmates Paco de Amparo, Pepe Torres, Manuel Flores, and Moi de Morón. The group's albums 'Son de la Frontera' (2004) and 'Cal' (2006) earned awards like Flamenco Hoy 2005 for Best Instrumental Soloist, deflamenco.com prizes, BBC Radio World Music Awards 2008, and a 2007 Grammy nomination, alongside international tours until 2008. He has produced key Martirio albums such as 'Flor de piel' (1999), 'Mucho Corazón' (2002, Grammy Latino nominee), 'De un mundo raro. Cantes por Chavela' (2013), and others, often featuring Chano Domínguez and flamenco-jazz fusions.[1][2][3]

His musical style fuses flamenco with Cuban son, guajira, jazz, and Latin American traditions, driven by anthropological research on transatlantic musical exchanges. Post-Son de la Frontera, Rodríguez pursued solo projects like 'Razón de Son' (2014), a book-disc of original compositions presented with the Tres Flamenco, and collaborations including Las Migas' second album (2012), Transversal with Pedro Javier González, Trilok Gurtu, and Guillem Aguilar (2013), and live shows with Chavela Vargas, Eugenia León, and Santiago Auserón. His legacy lies in innovating flamenco instrumentation and production, bridging cultures while maintaining deep roots in Morón de la Frontera's toque.[1][2][4]
