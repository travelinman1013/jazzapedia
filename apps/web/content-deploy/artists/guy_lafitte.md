## Biography
Guy Lafitte was born Denis Fernand Lafitte on January 12, 1927, in Saint-Gaudens, Haute-Garonne, France.[3][4] He emerged as one of the stars of jazz in Paris during the post-war years, establishing himself as a significant figure in European jazz despite remaining essentially overlooked in America.[2] Like Django Reinhardt, Lafitte began his career playing with gypsies, though unlike Django, he was formally trained. His musical philosophy extended beyond technical proficiency—his music was described as "not merely fine, mellow and swinging" but "an entire philosophy praising the joie de vivre."[1]

From 1955 to 1967, Lafitte was under contract to the EMI-Pathé Marconi group, during which he recorded dozens of albums spanning both pure jazz and commercial settings.[5] He was a prolific recording artist who worked consistently in quartet and sextet configurations, collaborating with many of France's finest jazz musicians. His tenor saxophone style was deeply rooted in the Coleman Hawkins tradition, incorporating all the elements of Hawk's approach into his own distinctive voice.[1][8] Lafitte continued performing and recording throughout his career until his death on June 10, 1998, in Tournan, France.[6]
