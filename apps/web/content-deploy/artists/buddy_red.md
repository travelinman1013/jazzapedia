## Biography
Buddy Red, born Messiah Harris, is the eldest son of rapper T.I. (Clifford Harris) and stepson of Tameka 'Tiny' Cottle, growing up in Atlanta in a musically prominent family. Initially exposed to hip-hop, R&B, and pop, he began making beats around age 16 but shifted to rock and blues after watching the 2018 film *Bohemian Rhapsody*, which introduced him to Freddie Mercury and classic rock, prompting him to buy a guitar and pursue performance over production[1][2][4][9]. Hearing Pink Floyd's 'Time' further shaped his vision, leading him to blend Delta blues with psychedelic rock, soul, and funk influences from Jimi Hendrix, Muddy Waters, Robert Johnson, Howlin’ Wolf, James Brown, and Bootsy Collins[1][3][4][5].

As a multi-instrumentalist proficient in guitar, bass, and drums, Buddy Red emerged in Atlanta's underground scene, becoming a fixture at Northside Tavern jam sessions known for his passionate storytelling and stage presence[3]. His debut single '1958,' self-produced at age 19 as a one-man band, highlighted his raw guitar work and lyricism, followed by a small discography including 'Sold His Soul' (2025), recorded in Brooklyn after a pivotal solo trip that boosted his confidence[1][2][3]. Named among ArtsATL’s Ones to Watch in 2025, he opened the Atlanta Jazz Festival and continues touring nationally while staying rooted in Atlanta[3][6].

Buddy Red's music critiques industry pressures, as in 'Sold His Soul,' which explores selling out for success, reflecting his commitment to authenticity amid his family's hip-hop legacy. He engages his community through partnerships with BMW of Atlanta and the Atlanta Hawks, echoing family traditions of giving back, positioning him as a blues-rock revivalist with cinematic flair[1][3].
