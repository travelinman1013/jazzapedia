## Biography
Steve Okonski is a classically trained pianist and jazz composer born and raised in Michigan, where he attended Eastern Michigan University studying classical piano before transitioning to jazz.[1] Initially without formal jazz training at his university, Okonski pursued jazz through electives and combos, eventually playing Hammond organ and performing in bar bands.[1] After a decade in New York City playing with bands including The National Reserve and Diane Cox, Okonski relocated to Asheville, North Carolina in 2019 with his wife Marissa, seeking a more balanced lifestyle away from constant touring.[1] His musical style is characterized by shimmery, cinematic compositions with dramatic changes and deliberate space between notes, creating an accessible yet artful sound that blends classical sensibilities with jazz improvisation.[1]

Okonski is best known as the leader of his eponymous piano trio, formed in winter 2020 with bassist Michael Isvara "Ish" Montgomery and drummer Aaron Frazer—both collaborators from the soul band Durand Jones & the Indications.[2][3] The trio's debut album *Magnolia* (2023) was recorded at Colemine Records' studio in Loveland, Ohio, initially conceived as beat-driven composed instrumentals but evolving to incorporate spontaneous improvisations.[2][3] A second recording session in summer 2021 yielded entirely improvised tracks recorded live to tape, establishing the group's signature meditative jazz sound.[2][3] The trio released their sophomore album *Entrance Music* in February 2026, continuing their exploration of spontaneous, luminous instrumental jazz.[6] Beyond his trio work, Okonski plays keyboards with THE EVER-EXPANDING, the local collective of Dr. Dog frontman Scott McMicken, and maintains an active performance schedule including residencies at venues like Leo's House of Thirst in Asheville.[1]

## Fun Facts
- Okonski performs on a Melodigrand, a 64-key midcentury spinet piano nicknamed the 'Tom Thumb Piano' for its compact, apartment-friendly size, which he uses to lead musical conversations with his collaborators.[1]
- The final track on Okonski's debut album *Magnolia*, titled 'Sunday,' was entirely improvised during an unplanned extra day of studio time when the group had leftover tape at the end of a recording session.[1]
- Okonski describes his musical approach as 'kind of tricking people into liking jazz' through his trio's beat-driven, melodic take on the often-maligned genre, making it more accessible to general audiences.[1]
- The trio's second album *Entrance Music* was recorded live to a Tascam 388 tape machine during several late nights at Colemine Records' studio in Loveland, Ohio, with all tracks improvised to capture spontaneous creative energy.[2]
