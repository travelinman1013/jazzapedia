## Biography
The Soft Winds was a jazz trio formed in 1946 by guitarist Herb Ellis, pianist Lou Carter, and bassist John Frigo, all of whom had been members of the Jimmy Dorsey Orchestra. Drawing inspiration from groups like the Nat King Cole Trio and Page Cavanaugh Trio, they developed a soft, breezy swing style characterized by intimate interplay among guitar, piano, and bass. The group recorded 16 tracks for Majestic and Mercury in 1947 and 1949, including originals like 'Detour Ahead' and 'I Told Ya, I Love Ya, Now Get Out,' though these remained unreissued for decades.[1][4][5]

Active until 1950, The Soft Winds gained a foothold in Boston's Darbury Room from 1949 to 1951, where their relaxed swing suited the venue perfectly. After disbanding, the members pursued individual careers: Ellis became a prominent jazz guitarist, Frigo transitioned to violin, and Carter maintained a low-profile but steady presence in jazz. In 1995, they reunited for a Chiaroscuro Records session with bassist Keter Betts, capturing their enduring chemistry on the album Softwinds: Then & Now, which also included rediscovered 1947 acetates.[1][6]

The Soft Winds' legacy lies in their sophisticated trio sound and compositional contributions, influencing small-group jazz despite limited commercial success and recordings. Their work exemplifies post-war jazz chamber music, bridging big band eras with modern trio formats.[1][4]

## Fun Facts
- The trio jointly composed the jazz standards 'Detour Ahead' and 'I Told Ya, I Love Ya, Now Get Out,' which became part of the broader jazz repertoire despite the group's obscurity.
- Their 1947-1949 recordings for Majestic and Mercury went unreissued for nearly 50 years until 13 lost acetate tracks surfaced in 1995.
- Perfectly suited to Boston's Darbury Room, they headlined there from 1949-1951 with their signature soft swing style.
- The 1995 reunion featured John Frigo on violin rather than bass, showcasing his versatility at age 80+.
