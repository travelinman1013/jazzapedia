## Biography
Benjamin David Goodman, born on May 30, 1909, in Chicago to poor Jewish immigrant parents, began playing clarinet at age 10 in a local synagogue and joined his first pit band by age 11. He quit school at 14 to pursue music professionally, joining the Ben Pollack orchestra in 1925 where he made his first solo recording on 'He's the Last Word' in 1926. After leaving Pollack in 1929, Goodman worked as a studio musician in New York, recording with artists like Billie Holiday, and began leading his own recordings in 1931. In 1934, he formed his first band, incorporating arrangements from Fletcher Henderson, and gained exposure on NBC's 'Let's Dance' radio show.[1][2][3]
