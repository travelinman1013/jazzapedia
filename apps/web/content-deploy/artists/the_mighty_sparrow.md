## Biography
Slinger Francisco, professionally known as Mighty Sparrow, was born on July 9, 1935, in Grand Roy, Grenada, and moved to Trinidad with his family at age one, where he grew up in Port of Spain. Exposed to music through his Catholic school choir, he developed an interest in calypso at age 14 by joining a neighborhood steelband. He adopted the stage name 'Mighty Sparrow' early in his career, reflecting his small stature but bold presence, and made his carnival debut in 1954 with 'The Parrot and the Monkey.' His breakthrough came in 1956 with 'Jean and Dinah,' which won him his first Calypso King title and revolutionized calypso by blending folk roots with jazz and American pop elements, transforming it into an international art form.[1][2][3][5][7]
