## Biography
Hugh Ramapolo Masekela was born on April 4, 1939, in Witbank, near Johannesburg, South Africa. He displayed early musical talent, playing piano as a child, but at age 14, inspired by the film 'Young Man with a Horn' featuring Kirk Douglas as jazz trumpeter Bix Beiderbecke, he took up the trumpet gifted by anti-apartheid activist Father Trevor Huddleston. This led to the formation of the Huddleston Jazz Band, South Africa's first youth orchestra, and he soon mastered the instrument under the guidance of local bandleader Uncle Sauda.[1][3][4][5]

Masekela's career blossomed in the late 1950s with performances in the musical 'King Kong' and as a key member of the Jazz Epistles alongside Abdullah Ibrahim, Kippie Moeketsi, and Jonas Gwangwa—the first African jazz group to record an LP—drawing record crowds in Johannesburg and Cape Town. Forced into exile after the 1960 Sharpeville Massacre, he moved abroad, recording with ex-wife Miriam Makeba, achieving a U.S. #1 hit with 'Grazing in the Grass' in 1968, and blending jazz, mbaqanga, funk, and Afro-soul. He set up a mobile studio in Botswana in the 1980s, collaborated on Paul Simon's Graceland tour, and released anti-apartheid anthems like 'Soweto Blues' and 'Bring Him Back Home,' the latter becoming a Mandela release anthem.[1][2][3][4][5][6]

Known as the 'father of South African jazz,' Masekela's style fused African rhythms with global jazz influences, evolving through phases of American R&B fusion, African jazz revival, and township sounds in albums like 'Techno-Bush,' 'Tomorrow,' and 'Uptownship.' He returned to South Africa in 1991 for his first tour post-apartheid, continued touring worldwide until his death on January 23, 2018, leaving a legacy of musical innovation, political defiance, and cultural unity.[1][3][4][5]
