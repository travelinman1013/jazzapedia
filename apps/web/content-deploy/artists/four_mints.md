## Biography
The Four Mints were a vocal group from Columbus, Ohio, consisting of Ben "Pete" Caldwell (lead vocals), James Brown, Donald Russell, and Jimmy Harmon. Active primarily in the late 1960s and early 1970s, they recorded for Bill Moss' Capsoul Records label, establishing themselves as one of the most influential local group harmony outfits in the Columbus soul scene. Their musical style blended R&B with soulful vocal harmonies, bringing conviction and authenticity to their performances.

The group achieved their greatest commercial success with their second single, "Row My Boat," written by arranger Dean Francis, which hit the R&B charts and became their biggest record. The success of this track led to the release of their only full-length LP, *Gently Down Your Stream*, in 1973—a creative zenith that showcased the group at their professional and intuitive peak. The album featured backing musicians from across the Midwest, including vibraphonist Billy Wooten from Indianapolis and drummer Bobby Allen of the Fabulous Originals from Dayton, Ohio, creating what amounted to a Midwest super-group sound.

Despite their artistic achievements and regional touring success across the Washington D.C. area, Kentucky, Indiana, and Michigan, the Four Mints disbanded after their third single, "Can't Get Strung Out" (1973), failed to gain traction. The group's legacy was preserved when Bill Moss reissued their LP on CD in 1995 as *The Original Four Mints*. Today, they remain recognized as Northern Soul favorites, with their work included on compilation albums such as *Dynamite Soul Harmony*, and they continue to be appreciated by soul music enthusiasts for their honest, homegrown approach to vocal group harmony.
