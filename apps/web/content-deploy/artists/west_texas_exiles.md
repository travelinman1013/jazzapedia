## Biography
The West Texas Exiles are a five-piece Americana band formed in Austin, Texas, around 2022, featuring musicians who grew up in West Texas cities including El Paso, Lubbock, and Amarillo. A love of music and desire to escape their hometowns drew them together, with the group rising from the embers of the Dirty River Boys, co-founded by guitarist Marco Gutierrez in 2009. The band showcases a triple-threat of singer-songwriters—Marco Gutierrez (lead guitar, raspy country blues rock voice), Daniel Davis (keys, accordion, folkish songs), and Colin Gilmore (mandolin, acoustic guitar, son of Jimmie Dale Gilmore, rowdy anthemic tunes)—backed by bassist Eric Harrison (also a producer) and drummer Trinidad Leal, both with ties to the Dirty River Boys.[1][2][3][4]

Their musical style blends alt-country and Americana, drawing from the wide-open landscapes of West Texas with influences spanning The Flatlanders, Buddy Holly, Blaze Foley, Willie Nelson, Ray Wylie Hubbard, Vampire Weekend, Augustana, and Jason Isbell. They debuted with the 2023 EP *Volume I*, celebrated with a sold-out show at Austin's Saxon Pub, followed by their first full-length album *8000 Days* released in 2024. The band has built a strong live presence through a weekly residency at the Continental Club, performances at SXSW, Willie Nelson’s Luck Reunion, Nashville’s Americanafest, Braun Brothers Reunion, and Hardly Strictly Bluegrass Festival, plus radio play on Sirius XM and a win in the 2022 International Songwriting Competition (Americana category).[1][2][3][4][5]

Rooted in geographical and musical isolation from West Texas, the Exiles evoke southwest Americana ghosts while pushing toward new horizons, as captured in lyrics like 'while I still got my boots on my feet.' Their sound reinvigorates Texas music traditions with rhythmic and lyrical honesty, reflecting reminiscence and the cosmic cowboy spirit of Austin's legacy.[1][4][5]

## Fun Facts
- The band formed a little over a year before their 2023 EP release, exploding from inception with SXSW official artist status, Sirius XM play, and a sold-out Saxon Pub debut.[1]
- Colin Gilmore and his father Jimmie Dale Gilmore have sung and played together for years; the Exiles backing Jimmie at Luck Reunion felt like a 'time-honored tradition.'[6]
- Geographical isolation in West Texas fostered the band's unity, as members bonded over niche interests in folk, punk, and Americana during high school when few locals listened to those genres.[5]
- Their debut album *8000 Days* (title referencing under 22 years) was recorded at Austin's Studio 601, co-produced by bassist Eric Harrison.[4]
