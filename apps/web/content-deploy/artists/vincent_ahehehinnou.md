## Biography
Vincent Ahehehinnou, born on May 10, 1946, in Benin, began his musical journey during college as a bassist and composer, initially playing for a school band before discovering his vocal talent when he sang his own composition meant for a larger orchestra.[2][3] He rose to prominence as one of the principal vocalists of the legendary Benin-based Orchestre Poly-Rythmo de Cotonou starting in 1968, helping transform the band from a nightclub act into an Africa-wide sensation, particularly after their explosive performance at the 1977 Festac festival in Lagos.[1][4][5] His style blends Afrobeat, highlife, Afro-funk, and traditional West African Voodoo rhythms with modern elements like soul, funk, salsa, and urban music, characterized by intricate guitar melodies, throbbing percussion, emotive vocals, and rhythmic vitality.[1][2][4]

In early 1978, Ahehehinnou was forced out of Orchestre Poly-Rythmo by manager Adissa Seidou due to creative and managerial conflicts, prompting him to pursue a solo career.[4][6][8] He traveled to Nigeria, collaborating with Ignace de Souza to record his debut solo album 'Best Woman' at Decca Studios in Lagos, released that year on Hasbunalau Records, featuring tracks like 'Maimouna Cherie' and showcasing his afrobeat credentials with driving beats and soulful delivery.[4][6] He released another album in Nigeria in 1982 and continued solo work, including 'La vie est belle' in 2023, while staying connected to Poly-Rythmo through European tours and preservation efforts.[1][2]

Ahehehinnou's legacy endures as a pivotal figure in West African music, maintaining relevance into recent years with reissues by Analog Africa and new releases that fuse traditional African sounds with contemporary influences, captivating global audiences and honoring Benin's musical heritage.[1][3][7]
