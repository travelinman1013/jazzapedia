## Biography
Mark Rubin, known as the 'Jew of Oklahoma,' was born in Stillwater, Oklahoma, where he grew up facing significant anti-Semitism and xenophobia in a rural environment that thrust ethnic identities upon outsiders, including cross-burnings experienced by his family. Raised in a context where assimilation was challenging, he was Oklahoma-born and Texas-reared, developing a deep connection to Southern culture while exploring his Jewish heritage later in life. In his mid-50s as of 2021, Rubin initially pursued music without Yiddish exposure due to his regional upbringing, but he immersed himself in the Yiddish Renaissance, becoming a klezmer specialist on bass and tuba, teaching internationally at events like Yiddish Summer Weimar, KlezFest London, and KlezMore Vienna.

Rubin co-founded the groundbreaking roots-punk band Bad Livers with Danny Barnes in the 1990s in Austin, Texas, playing bass and tuba, establishing himself as a pioneer in Americana, alt-country, and genre-bending fusions of bluegrass, klezmer, country, punk, and blues. Over a 30+ year career, he has worked as a multi-instrumentalist (banjo, guitar, bass, tuba), producer, and accompanist for numerous American traditional music figures. Since 2015, he has fronted the Jew of Oklahoma project as singer-songwriter, releasing albums like 'The Triumph of Assimilation' (2021), which blends his Southern 'nurture' with Jewish 'nature,' addressing anti-Semitism through sardonic, hopeful songs inspired by 'tikkun olam' (repairing the world). Now residing in New Orleans, Louisiana, his music delivers raw truth in honky-tonks and synagogue halls alike.

Rubin's legacy lies in bridging Southern Jewish identity, earning acclaim as 'one of the great Jewish musicians of our time' from the Weitzman Museum, and advocating for Southern Jews to embrace both heritages without fleeing the region. His work carries forward Yiddish protest traditions and Oklahoma roots with humor, horror, and rage, influencing perceptions of Jewish-American identity in the South.
