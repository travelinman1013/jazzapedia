## Biography
The Mambo Legends Orchestra, often associated with mambo and Latin jazz scenes, was formed by former musicians of the Tito Puente Orchestra, bringing together veterans to preserve and advance the iconic sounds of 1950s and 1960s Palladium-era mambo. Led by percussionist John 'Dandy' Rodriguez, who joined Tito Puente's band at age 17 in 1962 and performed with him for over 30 years until Puente's death in 2000, the group also features musical director Jose Madera and saxophonist/flutist Mitch Frohman, each with decades of experience in Puente's ensemble. Rodriguez's career included stints with Tito Rodriguez (1965-1968) and Ray Barretto (1970-1972), as well as leading his own Tipica 73 band (1972-1979), while Madera, son of Machito Orchestra arranger Jose 'Pin' Madera, served 31 years with Puente as percussionist, arranger, and director[1].

The orchestra's musical style centers on the vibrant mambo, cha cha cha, and Latin jazz pioneered by the 'Big 3'—Machito, Tito Rodriguez, and Tito Puente—infusing classic rhythms with progressive concepts to captivate international audiences. Madera has recreated and rearranged historic Palladium Ballroom repertoire, emphasizing innovative Latin jazz, while Frohman delivers signature sax and flute solos rooted in his 25 years with Puente. Their dedication maintains the genre's evolution, performing worldwide and conducting clinics to promote Latin percussion and music[1].

The group's legacy lies in perpetuating the golden age of New York Latin music, with members recognized as innovators—Rodriguez for advancing Latin performance globally alongside Latin Percussion founder Martin Cohen, Madera for decades of teaching at Boys Harbor, and Frohman for clinician work from elementary to conservatory levels. As a reorganization of Puente's alumni, they set a new standard for mambo, ensuring its sensory impact endures[1].
