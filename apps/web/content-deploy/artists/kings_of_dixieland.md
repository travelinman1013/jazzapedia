## Biography
No credible sources in the search results reference a musical artist specifically named 'Kings Of Dixieland.' The closest matches are the Original Dixieland Jass Band (ODJB), formed in 1916 in New Orleans and credited with the first jazz recordings, and the Dukes of Dixieland, a revival band started in 1948 by brothers Frank and Fred Assunto. It is possible 'Kings Of Dixieland' is a misremembered or obscure variant, but no biographical details exist for it[1][2][3][6].

The ODJB began when a Chicago promoter recruited clarinetist Alcide Nunez and drummer Johnny Stein to bring a New Orleans-style band north, assembling trombonist Eddie Edwards, pianist Henry Ragas, and cornetist Nick LaRocca (replacing Frank Christian). They debuted as Stein's Dixie Jass Band at Schiller's Cafe in 1916, later renaming to ODJB after lineup changes including Larry Shields on clarinet. They moved to New York in 1917, recording 'Livery Stable Blues' and 'Dixie Jass Band One-Step' for Victor, introducing jazz to wide audiences before disbanding in the 1920s and briefly reforming in 1936[1][2][4][5].

The Dukes of Dixieland emerged post-WWII from the Assunto family's Basin Street group, winning a 1949 talent contest as the Junior Dixieland Band. Renaming themselves, they toured, recorded for Vik in 1955, and played Las Vegas residencies, embodying Dixieland revival with traditional New Orleans jazz style until the original lineup ended in the 1970s after the brothers' deaths[3][6].
