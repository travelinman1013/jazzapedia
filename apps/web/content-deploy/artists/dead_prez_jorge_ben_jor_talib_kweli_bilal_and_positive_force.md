## Biography
Dead Prez is a politically conscious hip-hop duo formed by stic.man (born Clayton Gavin, 1975, Shadeville, Florida) and M-1 (born Lavon Alfred, 1973, Jamaica, West Indies), who met in 1990-1991 while attending Florida A&M University in Tallahassee, Florida. Inspired by the crack epidemic's impact on their families—stic.man's mother was arrested on drug charges—and revolutionary figures like Malcolm X, they prioritized activism, joining groups such as Tallahassee’s Black Survival Movement and later the National People’s Democratic Uhuru Movement, before turning to music as a platform for challenging racism, economic oppression, and the power structure.[1][3][4] Relocating to New York in the mid-1990s, they were discovered by Lord Jamar of Brand Nubian at a Brooklyn block party, leading to a deal with Loud Records.[1][3]

Their career launched with underground appearances like the 1997 Loud Set Up tape track 'Food, Clothes, And Shelter' and collaborations on Big Pun's 1998 album Capital Punishment, including 'Police State With Chairman Omali' and 'It's Bigger Than Hip-Hop.' Their debut album, Let's Get Free (2000), established them as revolutionary rap leaders with Afrocentric, self-reliant lyrics over hard-hitting beats, followed by mixtapes Turn Off The Radio Vol. 1 (2002) and Vol. 2 (2003), and sophomore album RBG: Revolutionary But Gangsta (2004). Their style blends east coast hip hop, hip hop, and jazz rap influences from Public Enemy and X-Clan, emphasizing resistance and community activism alongside martial arts training and self-sufficiency.[1][2][4][5]

Dead Prez's legacy endures through solo projects like stic.man's 'fit hop' album The Workout and M-1's AP2P, mixtape series, and ongoing RBG (Revolutionary But Gangsta) movement, maintaining authentic hip-hop representation amid commercial success while balancing music with activism, including distributing newspapers and sewing their own clothes.[2][3]
