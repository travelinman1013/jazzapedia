## Biography
John Gary Williams, born in 1945 in Memphis, Tennessee, formed the doo-wop inspired group The Mad Lads while attending Booker T. Washington High School in South Memphis, alongside Julius E. Green, William Brown, and Robert Phillips. Initially known as The Emeralds, they renamed to The Mad Lads at the suggestion of Stax Records staff after signing with the label, releasing their debut 'The Sidewalk Surf' and achieving hits like 'Don’t Have to Shop Around' (1965) and 'I Want Someone' (1966), characterized by a Northern soul sound distinct from gritty Southern soul.[1][2][4] Their career was interrupted in 1966 when Williams and Brown were drafted into the Vietnam War, leading to psychological challenges including PTSD for Williams upon his return.[1][3]

After the war, Williams engaged in the Civil Rights Movement, joining the Invaders during the 1968 Memphis Sanitation Workers Strike, amid controversy over related riots. He attempted to reform The Mad Lads but shifted toward social consciousness, releasing his solo album *John Gary Williams* in 1973 on Stax, featuring the Northern soul cult classic 'The Whole Damn World is Going Crazy.' Stax's bankruptcy ended his recording career there, though he continued writing music and later reformed The Mad Lads with his brother Richard, performing for fans including Northern soul enthusiasts from England in 2015.[1][2][3][4]

In his later years, Williams championed the Stax Music Academy and Soulsville Charter School, performed at the Stax Museum, and acted as a neighborhood counselor helping gang members. He passed away on May 28, 2019, at age 73, leaving a legacy of soul music endurance, redemption, and community service.[1][4]

## Fun Facts
- The Mad Lads were renamed from The Emeralds because another group already used that name; Stax's Deanie Parker suggested 'Mad Lads' due to their prankster antics.[1]
- Williams' 1973 solo album featured the Memphis Symphony Orchestra for sweeping strings and was produced amid Stax's financial turmoil, with some tracks evoking Isaac Hayes' style.[3]
- In 2015, English Northern Soul fans organized a Memphis pilgrimage around Williams, leading to a surprise performance by a reformed Mad Lads that ended in a 'mosh pit'.[1]
- Later in life, Williams counseled gang members overnight, acting as a neighborhood minister, and described Stax as the first place he experienced racial harmony.[1]
