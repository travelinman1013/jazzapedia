## Biography
Gravity A is a New Orleans-based band formed in 2004, deeply rooted in the city's vibrant music scene, blending dynamic energy with innovative sounds. The band emerged after drummer Michael Fouquier's transformative experiences, including attending his first State Palace rave produced by Disco Donnie and a spontaneous trip to the High Sierra Music Festival in 2003, which inspired him to return home and start the project. Initial lineups featured Jon Solomon on bass, guitarist Carter briefly, and later Aaron Lind transitioning from keyboards to guitar, with performances on Frenchmen Street venues like the Blue Nile and Hi Ho Lounge.[1]

Hurricane Katrina in 2005 disrupted the band, but upon returning, they solidified with keyboardist Andrew Meehan, whom Fouquier considers an original member. Subsequent changes included Aaron Lind leaving for a yoga career, replaced by guitarist Danny Abel; bassist John Solomon departing for Kumasi, followed by Bru Bruser from Government Magic, and finally Devin Karagan on bass, completing the current lineup. This evolution led to their 2013 album 'New Beginnings' recorded at Piety Street Studios (after earlier 'Naissance'), sparking extensive U.S. touring at venues like Cervantes in Denver, Boom Boom Room in San Francisco, and Nectar’s in Vermont, plus festivals like Camp BISCO, Wakarusa, and opening for Pretty Lights.[1]

The band paused during the pandemic, allowing members like Fouquier to focus on family and personal growth, enhancing their musicianship. By 2023, they announced a triumphant return, with Fouquier noting improved mental clarity, versatility from diverse gigs, and renewed excitement for their catalog, positioning them at the peak of their careers.[1]
