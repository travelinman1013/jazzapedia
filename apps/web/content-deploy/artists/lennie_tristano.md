## Biography
Leonard Joseph Tristano was born on March 19, 1919, in Chicago, Illinois, where he was afflicted with vision loss from influenza at birth, becoming fully blind by age 10. His mother, a pianist and opera singer, introduced him to music early; he learned piano, clarinet, and saxophone with minimal formal lessons and attended a school for the blind before studying at the American Conservatory of Music, earning degrees by 1943. In Chicago's jazz scene during the early 1940s, Tristano played professionally, broke from influences like Art Tatum, married musician Judy Moore, met teenage Lee Konitz, and began teaching improvisation using innovative methods like transcribing and singing jazz masters' solos.[1][2][3][5]

Moving to New York City in 1946, Tristano quickly gained acclaim, playing with bebop giants Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, and Miles Davis, and forming bands emphasizing contrapuntal interplay, harmonic flexibility, and rhythmic complexity. His 1949 quintet recorded pioneering free group improvisations like 'Intuition' and 'Digression,' often cited as early free jazz, and he experimented with multi-tracking on 'Descent into the Depths.' By the early 1950s, he prioritized teaching over performing, opening a Manhattan studio that closed in 1956, then continuing private lessons on Long Island; his structured approach pioneered jazz education.[1][3][4][5]

Tristano's style blended cool jazz precision with bebop intricacy, favoring analytical reconfiguration of melodies through counterpoint over flashy virtuosity, earning both praise and criticism—some derisively called it 'Chinese music.' He retreated from public life after a 1965 Europe tour and 1968 U.S. appearance, focusing on teaching until his death on November 18, 1978, in New York City. His legacy endures through proteges and subtle influences on later jazz like Miles Davis's 1960s quintet.[1][2][3]

## Fun Facts
- Tristano was born with vision impaired by influenza and fully blind by age 10, yet led a traditional band as a 12-year-old clarinetist and became a jazz pioneer.[2]
- In 1949, his quintet recorded 'Intuition' and 'Digression,' widely recognized as the first free group improvisations in jazz, predating later free jazz movements.[4][5]
- Following Charlie Parker's death in 1955, Tristano spontaneously recorded a solo blues piece titled 'Requiem' in his studio, a rare emotional outpouring released later.[1]
- Tristano opened his own jazz school in 1951 but closed it in 1956, preferring private lessons in his Long Island apartment; he discouraged students like Lee Konitz from 'commercial' gigs.[1][3]
