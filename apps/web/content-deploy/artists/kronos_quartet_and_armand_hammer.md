## Biography
Kronos Quartet is a legendary San Francisco-based string quartet founded in 1973, renowned for revolutionizing contemporary classical music through avant-garde and minimalist approaches, collaborating with icons like John Cage, Tanya Tagaq, Astor Piazzolla, and Terry Riley[1]. Armand Hammer, a New York City hip hop duo formed around 2013 by Billy Woods and Elucid, has built a cult following with critically acclaimed albums such as Race Music (2013), Rome (2017), Paraffin (2018), Shrines (2020), Haram (2021, with The Alchemist), and We Buy Diabetic Test Strips (2023), blending abstract, experimental rap with dense production[5]. Their musical styles—Kronos in minimalism and contemporary classical, Armand Hammer in avant-garde hip hop—intersect in boundary-pushing projects[1][5].

The collaboration between Kronos Quartet and Armand Hammer emerged prominently in 2024 on the tribute album Outer Spaceways Incorporated: Kronos Quartet & Friends Meet Sun Ra, released by Red Hot Organization to celebrate Kronos' 50th anniversary. This eclectic project features interpolations of Sun Ra's cosmic jazz, with Armand Hammer joining RP Boo on the track 'Blood Running High,' alongside contributions from Laurie Anderson, Jlin, Moor Mother, and others, showcasing Kronos' role in bridging genres[1][2][3][4][5][6]. This partnership highlights their shared commitment to experimental innovation, marking a key development in fusing string quartet precision with hip hop abstraction.

Their legacy endures through Kronos' blueprint for concert music evolution and Armand Hammer's influence in underground rap, with the Sun Ra tribute amplifying their impact on contemporary avant-garde scenes as of 2025[1][5].
