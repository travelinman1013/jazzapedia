## Biography
Luedji Gomes Santa Rita, known professionally as Luedji Luna, was born on May 25, 1987, in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil, to an economist mother and a historian father. Growing up immersed in the Afro-Brazilian culture of Bahia, she studied law at the Federal University of Bahia before pursuing her passion for music, training in singing at the Escola Baiana de Canto Popular. Her early exposure to jazz and blues at home shaped her eclectic style, blending these influences with Bahian rhythms. She began performing in 2011 and debuted with the single 'Dentro ali' in 2014.[2][4]

Luedji Luna's career gained momentum with her 2017 debut album *Um Corpo no Mundo*, which earned her a Bravo Award and a nomination for Best New Artist at the 2018 Multishow Brazilian Music Award. Her 2020 sophomore album *Bom Mesmo É Estar Debaixo d’Água* was nominated for a Latin Grammy for Best MPB Album in 2021 and won Best Album of the Year at the WME Music Awards. Her music fuses neo-MPB, jazz, samba de roda, afoxé, R&B, and African rhythms, often addressing black feminism, identity, race, womanhood, resistance, and spirituality rooted in her Afro-Brazilian heritage. She has toured extensively in the United States, Europe, and Canada, performing at festivals like the Montreal International Jazz Festival and Amsterdam Roots Festival.[1][4][5]

As a prominent figure in contemporary Brazilian music, Luedji Luna stands as a spiritual and indomitable force, using her poetry and compositions to challenge stereotypes of Black women in Brazilian music, rejecting the samba export mold in favor of global, innovative sounds. Her work symbolizes empowerment, healing, and the reinvention of Brazil through Afro-Brazilian narratives, making her a voice for social justice and a key representative of Bahia's cultural heartbeat.[3][5]
