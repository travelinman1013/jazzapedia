## Biography
James Suggs, a jazz trumpeter, was born in Rochester, New York, and raised in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, before moving to Ohio. He began playing trumpet at age nine and met jazz legend Wynton Marsalis at age ten backstage in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, receiving an impromptu lesson that inspired him to pursue jazz trumpet. By age thirteen, private teachers introduced him to the music of Louis Armstrong, Dizzy Gillespie, Miles Davis, and Marsalis, emphasizing transcription. At fifteen, he played professionally with jazz groups in Northeast Ohio and joined the Canton Youth Orchestra; at sixteen, he toured the US and Europe with the evangelical Continental Singers. Suggs earned a Bachelor’s degree in music performance with a jazz emphasis from Youngstown State University on scholarship, performing in big bands, combos, orchestras, salsa, and Latin jazz groups under professors like Tony Leonardi and Kent Engelhardt, and touring Beijing's conservatories in his junior year.[1][2][3][5]

Post-graduation, Suggs worked on six cruise ships with Norwegian and Royal Caribbean lines from 2000-2006, visiting the Caribbean and Hawaii, marking his entry as a professional musician. In 2005, he became trumpet soloist for the Glenn Miller Orchestra under Larry O’Brien, touring the US and recording 'Steppin’ Out,' followed by the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra under Buddy Morrow. That November, he moved to Buenos Aires, Argentina, for eight years, playing professionally, teaching privately, learning Spanish, and touring worldwide with bands including Los Pericos as their sole trumpeter, performing in Portugal, London, South America, and the US. In 2014, he relocated to St. Petersburg, Florida, immersing in the Tampa Bay scene, earning a Master’s in jazz performance from the University of South Florida in 2018, and releasing his debut album 'You’re Gonna Hear from Me' on Arbors Records, produced by Houston Person at Rudy Van Gelder Studios, featuring Lafayette Harris, Lewis Nash, Peter Washington, and Person, reaching #16 on JazzWeek charts.[2][3][4][6]

Now an adjunct professor at USF, Suggs directs Jazz Ensemble 2 and combos, teaches jazz trumpet, and performs at festivals like Suncoast Jazz, Newport Beach, Sarasota, and Clearwater. He earned 'Best Jazz Transplant' from Best of the Bay in 2015 and continues building his reputation in Florida's jazz community, blending global experiences into his hard bop, jazz ballad, and ragtime-influenced style.[2][4][5]
