## Biography
Johnny Sketch and the Dirty Notes (JSDN) formed in 2001 in New Orleans as a half-joke entry for a Loyola University Battle of the Bands, which they won, launching their enduring career as a classically trained ensemble defying categorization with irreverent funk infused with rock riffs, Gypsy/Klezmer elements, Latin tinges from a hard-hitting horn section, and humor.[1][2][3] Frontman Johnny Sketch, real name Marc Paradis (born in Maine), plays guitar, electric cello, and lead vocals, having relocated to New Orleans to play in rock bands before forming JSDN; the band grew from this foundation, developing a tight-knit cohesiveness evident in their dynamic live shows that shift from groovy funk to frenzied rock, prioritizing audience fun.[1][2][4][5] Their musical style reflects New Orleans funkiness amplified with louder rock volume, drawing comparisons to Phish born at Tipitina’s under George Clinton and Frank Zappa influences, while building a loyal fanbase across the U.S. through relentless touring and performances like their memorable 2005 Jazz Fest debut before 35-40,000 people alongside Galactic and Dave Matthews Band.[1][3]

Over two decades, JSDN has released albums like 'The Big Awesome (Full Frontal),' showcasing their eclectic blend of jazz, funk, rock, prog, and metal with frequent gear shifts, maintaining a mystical alter-ego persona—members perform under pseudonyms like Busta Gnutt (Dave Pomerleau, bass), Dirty Johnny (Andre Bohren, drums), Johnny Rico (Omar Ramirez, trumpet/flugelhorn), Sage Rouge (Sage Newell, saxophones), and Josh Paxton (keyboards)—while emphasizing live energy over personal revelation.[2][4][7] Their legacy endures as New Orleans staples, rocking venues nationwide with a commitment to 'funking beyond the call of duty,' rooted in rigorous classical and jazz training from top institutions.[3][4]
