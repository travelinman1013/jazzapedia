## Biography
The Gladiators are a Jamaican roots reggae band formed in 1967 in Kingston, Jamaica, by Albert Griffiths, a guitarist and singer born in 1945 in St. Elizabeth parish who grew up in poverty in Trench Town. Inspired by the film Ben Hur, Griffiths named the group to symbolize the fight for freedom against oppression, starting with initial members Errol Grandison and David Webber. Their first hit, 'Hello Carol,' topped Jamaican charts in 1968 at Studio One, where Griffiths worked as a session guitarist backing artists like Burning Spear, John Holt, the Ethiopians, and Stranger Cole. Webber left due to health issues, and Clinton Fearon joined on bass in 1969, with Gallimore Sutherland later completing the classic trio on rhythm guitar.[1][2][4][5]

The band's peak came in the 1970s with iconic albums like Trenchtown Mix Up (1976) and Proverbial Reggae (1978), featuring hits such as 'Chatty Chatty Mouth,' 'Soul Rebel' (a Wailers cover), 'Hearsay,' 'Jah Works,' 'Dreadlocks the Time is Now,' 'Roots Natty,' and 'Bongo Red.' They recorded for producers like Coxone Dodd, Clive Chin, Duke Reid, and Vivian 'Yabby U' Jackson at Lee 'Scratch' Perry's Black Ark, developing a distinctive roots reggae sound blending spiritual lyrics, resilience themes, and rocksteady influences. Despite 1980s challenges, including pressure from Virgin Records to alter their style amid dancehall's rise, they maintained authenticity, building international fans in Brazil and Europe.[1][2][3][4][5]

Albert Griffiths retired in 2006 due to Parkinson's disease and passed away on December 15, 2020. Gallimore Sutherland died in January 2017. The band continues under Griffiths' sons, Al Jr. and Anthony, with Droop Lion, as seen in the 2005 album Father and Sons, preserving their legacy of unity and roots reggae endurance.[1][2][4]
