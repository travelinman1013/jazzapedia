## Biography
La Reezy, born Khayree Salahuddin, is a 21-year-old self-taught music artist, producer, and composer from New Orleans.[1][2] His musical journey began at age 8 when he would dress up and perform in the mirror, evolving into serious music production at age 14 when he started recording songs with a $50 microphone.[2] By his early twenties, La Reezy had established himself as a rising figure in hip-hop, known for his rich storytelling, nostalgic boom-bap production, and introspective lyricism that addresses themes of mental health, self-improvement, and breaking generational cycles.

La Reezy's artistic approach is characterized by an "old soul" sensibility that blends contemporary rap with vintage influences.[2] His music emphasizes authenticity and purpose—he has stated that "every song might be the last song someone hears" and approaches each track with intentionality.[2] In 2024, he released the album "We All Need Help," a vulnerable 8-track project co-produced by New York-based producer JBoogz that explores themes of healing and acceptance.[2] His breakthrough came in 2025, a year he declared would be his own, during which the 21-year-old released three albums, one EP, multiple singles and features, and toured with British rapper Little Simz.[1] He closed 2025 with a notable performance at Camp Flog Gnaw, establishing himself as one of hip-hop's emerging voices.
