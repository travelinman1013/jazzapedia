## Biography
Autry McNeace, known as Eagle Park Slim, was born on January 11, 1942, in Eagle Park, Illinois. He grew up immersed in the blues, starting to play at his mother’s club, The Village Tavern, in 1954. By age 9, he learned harmonica from Harmonica Sam, using his discarded instruments, and later picked up guitar. In the 1960s, he performed regularly at Leo’s Tavern in Eagle Park with Little Walter J. & His Hard Working Phantoms, and expanded to East St. Louis and St. Louis, playing with blues pianist Johnnie Johnson.[1][2][4]

Slim's career took him across the U.S., collaborating with legends like Chuck Berry, James Brown, Muddy Waters, Jimmy Reed, Sonny Boy Williamson, Percy Mayfield, Ike Turner, Little Walter, Joe Cocker, Keb Mo, and The Red Hot Chili Peppers. In the 1970s, he moved to Colorado, where Eagle Park Slim & The Mile High Blues Band became the house band at a Denver after-hours club. At age 38 in 1980, he relocated to Eugene, Oregon, becoming a fixture in the local blues scene as a busker with just his guitar and kazoo, performing in streets, coffeehouses, and markets. His motto was “ain’t no time to hate,” and he promoted “peace through music,” sustaining himself primarily through busking.[1][2][3]

A modern blues artist, Slim was known for songs drawn from daily experiences and feelings. He remained active in Eugene for over 30 years, playing with groups like The Vipers and mentoring locals. He passed away in August 2016 at age 74.[1][2][3][7]
