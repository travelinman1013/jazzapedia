## Biography
Joshua Redman, born February 1, 1969, in Berkeley, California, to jazz saxophonist Dewey Redman and dancer Renee Shedroff, grew up immersed in music but initially pursued academics, graduating summa cum laude from Harvard University in 1991 and deferring Yale Law School to focus on jazz after winning the Thelonious Monk International Jazz Competition.[1][2][4] Signing with Warner Bros. Records in 1992, he released his self-titled debut album in 1993, earning his first Grammy nomination, and quickly rose in the New York jazz scene through collaborations and albums like MoodSwing (1994), which featured his quartet with Brad Mehldau, Christian McBride, and Brian Blade.[1][2][4][5]

In 2002, Redman formed the Joshua Redman Elastic Band, a flexible, electrified trio blending jazz with funk and groove elements, initially with keyboardist Sam Yahel and drummer Brian Blade, debuting on albums Yaya3 and Elastic; Jeff Ballard later joined regularly, contributing to the Grammy-nominated Momentum (2005).[2][3][4] This marked a shift from his acoustic quartets, incorporating electric instruments while maintaining improvisational depth, as developed through informal gigs at New York's Small's club since 1997.[3] Redman's style evolved across genres like jazz fusion, collaborating extensively and releasing innovative works into the 2020s.[1][2]

Redman's legacy endures as a bridge between jazz tradition and innovation, with over ten Grammy nominations, leadership in groups like James Farm, and projects like Walking Shadows (2013) and Where Are We (2023), solidifying his role as a prolific composer and bandleader.[1][2][5]
