## Biography
Water Seed is an American funk band founded by drummer, composer, and vocalist Lou Hill at Xavier University in New Orleans approximately 15 years prior to 2017 (around 2002).[1] The band emerged from New Orleans' vibrant musical landscape, developing a distinctive sound that blends funk, rock, hip hop, and jazz—a fusion they have coined as 'Future Funk.'[6] Their music draws inspiration from legendary artists including James Brown, Sly and the Family Stone, Prince, and Earth Wind and Fire, while capturing a modern sensibility comparable to Bruno Mars, Mark Ronson, and Childish Gambino.[3]

Water Seed's trajectory was significantly shaped by Hurricane Katrina, which prompted the band to relocate to Atlanta after their New Orleans origins.[1] During their time in Atlanta, the collective honed their musical craft and gained business acumen, solidifying their group membership and artistic vision.[1] After three years away, the band returned to New Orleans and successfully reintegrated into the local musical landscape, performing at festivals and venues while earning recognition from established artists like Cyril Neville.[1] Their fifth studio album, *We Are Stars*, achieved notable chart success, peaking at number 27 on the Billboard 200's R&B chart and number 8 on the Heatseekers chart, establishing them as Billboard Top 40 recording artists.[1][3]

The band is characterized by their energetic live performances, featuring coordinated choreography and tight, intricate musicianship.[1][6] Water Seed continues to spearhead the progressive R&B movement, bridging musical gaps between classic soul-funk traditions and contemporary R&B sensibilities.[3] As of 2026, the band remains based in New Orleans, Louisiana, and continues to perform at major festivals and venues.
