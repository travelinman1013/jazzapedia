## Biography
Louis Armstrong (1901-1971) was born in New Orleans in a neighborhood so impoverished it was called "The Battlefield." At age seven, he received his first musical instrument—a ten-cent tin horn—which he used to draw customers to his rag-peddling wagon, setting him on the path to becoming jazz's greatest soloist. Armstrong would become the central figure in jazz history for his revolutionary solo playing and singing, elevating the genre into a pulsating force for spontaneity and freedom. Duke Ellington (1899-1974), born Edward Kennedy Ellington and the grandson of slaves, emerged as jazz's finest composer and bandleader. Unlike Armstrong, Ellington was a man of refined sophistication whose music transcended category, characterized by compositional complexity and "the unpredictable unfolding of different sound images." Both men, born within a few years of one another, overcame racist exclusion and violence to become the most popular entertainers on the planet, fundamentally transforming twentieth-century American music and culture. Though they came to prominence in the 1920s as giants of jazz, Armstrong and Ellington recorded only one album together—*The Great Summit* (1961)—a collaboration that came decades after their initial rise to fame, recorded for Roulette Records on April 3-4, 1961, featuring Armstrong performing 17 Ellington compositions with Duke's orchestra.

## Fun Facts
- Armstrong received his first musical instrument at age seven—a ten-cent tin horn—which he used to draw customers to his rag-peddling wagon in New Orleans, launching his musical career.
- During the filming of *Paris Blues*, Armstrong played Ellington compositions "Battle Royal" and "Wild Man" in his character role, while Duke spent three weeks in Paris composing music for the film, which he described as "the closest thing to a vacation" he'd ever taken.
- Jazz historian Dan Morgenstern noted that Armstrong was "one of the quickest studies to ever set foot in a studio," and Ellington's chronicler Stanley Dance observed that Armstrong seemed to know the Ellington routines better than clarinetist Barney Bigard, who had spent 15 years with Duke's orchestra.
- Duke Ellington composed over 6,000 compositions throughout his career and later honored Armstrong with a "Portrait of Louis Armstrong" in his celebrated late-career work *The New Orleans Suite*.
