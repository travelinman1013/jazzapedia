## Biography
Amy Elizabeth Ray was born on April 12, 1964, in Decatur, Georgia. Her musical beginnings trace back to her childhood in the mid-1970s, when as a young girl she played Partridge Family songs on guitar and dreamed of being teen idol David Cassidy. By age 10, she met Emily Saliers, and the two began performing together, initially as 'Saliers and Ray' in school, church shows, and talent competitions. They formed the Indigo Girls in high school around 1981, releasing a basement tape 'Tuesday's Children' and later signing with Epic Records in 1988, earning a Grammy in 1990 for their folk-rock work. Ray graduated from Emory University in 1986 while continuing to develop her passion for music, activism in environmental, human rights, and women's issues, and founding the independent label Daemon Records.[1][2][3][4][5][7]
