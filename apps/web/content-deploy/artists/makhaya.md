## Biography
Makhaya Ntshoko, born in 1939 in Langa, Cape Town, South Africa, grew up in a musical family with his father as a church organist and his brother a saxophonist. Raised as a quiet, sober young man who neither drank nor smoked, he was initially trained on drums by Phaks Joya, with early support from bassist Lami Zokufa who convinced his strict father to buy him a drum kit and later allow him to pursue music professionally. Showing early promise as both a boxer and musician, Ntshoko joined South Africa's pioneering modern jazz group, the Jazz Epistles, alongside Jonas Gwangwa and others, touring the country before moving to Johannesburg. He gained international exposure as part of the King Kong pit band in London, where he shared a flat with Gwangwa and recommitted to drumming after being inspired by Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers.

Returning briefly to Cape Town, Ntshoko gigged with local bands like Cups Nkanuka’s Peninsula Stars and Tete Mbambisa’s Jazz Giants before permanently relocating to Europe in the early 1960s with Abdullah Ibrahim (then Dollar Brand). Spending 1963-65 with Ibrahim’s ensembles in Switzerland and gigging across Denmark, France, and England, he worked with luminaries like Duke Ellington. By the 1970s, he formed Makhaya and the Tsotsis with Swiss musicians, releasing their debut album in 1974, and collaborated with South African exiles Johnny Dyani and Dudu Pukwana, as well as international stars including John Tchicai, Joe McPhee, Dexter Gordon, and Joe Henderson. His style blended South African jazz roots with global influences, emphasizing disciplined, intensive practice.

Ntshoko settled into a distinguished career in Switzerland, balancing club residencies, European festivals, and teaching at the Basel Music Academy. He returned to South Africa occasionally, such as in 2007 for the National Jazz Festival in Makhanda (formerly Grahamstown) with the Swiss-South African Jazz Quintet featuring Feya Faku, and released the album Happy House in 2008. Known for his quiet demeanor and powerhouse drumming, Ntshoko left a legacy as a bridge between South African jazz innovation and international scenes.

## Fun Facts
- Ntshoko was a promising boxer in his youth, with mentors advising him to 'loosen up' his steely muscle memory for drumming, as it felt like 'weightlifting.'
- After seeing Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers in London, he was so overawed he swore never to play drums again, but bought a new kit two weeks later and practiced intensely.
- His father, fearing music would corrupt his sober habits, had to be repeatedly persuaded by bandmates to allow travel to Johannesburg, London, and Europe.
- He formed his band Makhaya and the Tsotsis with talented Swiss players in the early 1970s, blending his South African roots with European talent.
