## Biography
Tinga Stewart, born Neville Stewart around July 3, 1950, in Kingston, Jamaica, began his musical career in the late 1960s with his first single 'She's Gone,' a duet with Ernest Wilson of The Clarendonians, followed by 'Hear That Train' produced by Derrick Harriott.[1][2] He performed with bands like The Wildcats and Byron Lee & the Dragonaires before joining the Boris Gardiner Happening as lead vocalist from 1971 to 1974, where he honed his soulful style covering American soul tunes while entertaining on the hotel and club circuit.[1][2][3] Going solo in 1973, he scored a hit with 'Funny Feeling' and won the Festival Song Contest in 1974 with Ernie Smith's 'Play de Music,' marking his breakthrough.[1][2]

Stewart's career peaked in the late 1970s and 1980s with recordings at Channel One Studios, including soul covers like 'Rainy Night in Georgia' and 'Why Can't We Live Together,' and another Festival win in 1981 with 'Nuh Wey Nuh Better Dan Yard,' produced by Rita Marley and written by Sangie Davis, earning him the title of Jamaica's most popular reggae artist that year.[1][2][3] He released over 200 singles and 12 albums, collaborating with deejays like Ninjaman on hits such as 'Take Time To Know,' and toured extensively in Japan, the US, Canada, England, and Africa, while also working as a producer.[1][3] His style blends lovers rock, reggae, and rocksteady with soulful ballads expressing love and culture.[1][2]

In later years, Stewart continued recording, reuniting with producer Willie Lindo for the 2000 album *Unforgettable* and releasing joint albums with his brother Roman Stewart, *Brother to Brother* and *Break Down the Barrier.* He received awards including a Lifetime Achievement Award in 2004 and keys to Fort Lauderdale in 2002, cementing his legacy as a versatile reggae veteran.[3]
