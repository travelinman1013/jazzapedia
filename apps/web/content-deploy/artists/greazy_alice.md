## Biography
Greazy Alice is the musical project of Alex Pianovich, a Pennsylvania-born songwriter and musician based in New Orleans.[1][4] Pianovich initially pursued a career in herpetology, studying biology in college and working in a herpetology lab for several years while living in the woods—a period during which he began playing guitar and writing songs.[1] At age twenty-one, he relocated to New Orleans after a college bandmate recommended it as an ideal city for musicians, and he has since built a career primarily performing his own material and collaborating with other artists.[1] The Greazy Alice project evolved from Pianovich's earlier solo work and various band iterations; since partnering with vocalist Jo Morris, the project has consolidated into a cohesive unit performing as both a duo and a full band.[1] The band's name derives from a character in Terry Allen's 1975 song cycle *Juarez*, discovered when Pianovich was searching for a band name approximately ten years before the 2025 interview.[1][5]

Greazy Alice's sound blends country, blues, and rock influences, characterized by what has been described as "sleazy hard-riffing rock n roll, smoky dive bar blues, and telecaster-driven honky tonk twang."[3] Pianovich's musical journey was shaped by exposure to classic rock and country through artists like The Rolling Stones and Gram Parsons, as well as 1990s country music.[1] The project released its debut EP *Just Another One* in 2025, followed by the EP *Circles* in November 2025, with a full-length album *As Time Goes By* released at the end of 2025.[1][2] The band is signed to Loose Music and performed in the United Kingdom in August 2025 as a two-piece, with plans to perform as a full band at the Kilkenny Roots Festival in May 2026.[1]
