## Biography
Larry Cordle is a Grammy Award-winning country and bluegrass singer-songwriter born November 16, 1948, in Louisa, eastern Kentucky.[3] Raised on a small family farm, Cordle was introduced to bluegrass, country, and gospel music by his great-grandfather Harry Bryant, an accomplished claw hammer banjo stylist, fiddle player, and dancer.[1][4] According to family recollection, Cordle could sing "I'll Fly Away" completely through at just two years old.[2] His early musical foundation, combined with family jam sessions at his grandfather's country store in Cordell, shaped his deep connection to traditional Appalachian music.

Cordle's career spans four decades as both a prolific songwriter and performing artist.[1] As a songwriter, he has written or co-written numerous bluegrass and country classics for industry giants including Ricky Skaggs, Garth Brooks, Alison Krauss, George Strait, Trisha Yearwood, Alan Jackson, and Reba McEntire, with his songs appearing on projects that have sold over 55 million copies combined.[1] He is most famous for "Murder on Music Row," recorded by George Strait and Alan Jackson, which won the Country Music Association Award for Vocal Event of the Year and received a CMA nomination for Song of the Year in 2000.[3] Alongside his songwriting success, Cordle maintained a performing career with his bluegrass band Lonesome Standard Time, which he founded in 1990 with Glen Duncan.[3] The band's self-titled debut album earned a Grammy nomination in 1992, and in 2003, Cordle collaborated with Carl Jackson and Jerry Salley on "Livin', Lovin', Losin': Songs of the Louvin Brothers," which won the Grammy for Best Country Album and was named the 2004 Event of the Year by the International Bluegrass Music Association.[1]

Cordle's legacy extends across multiple musical genres and collaborative projects. He has received numerous accolades including two Grammy nominations for Best Bluegrass Album (1992 and 2000), IBMA Song of the Year awards (1993 for "Lonesome Standard Time" and 2000 for "Murder on Music Row"), and over 20 top 40 Country and Bluegrass hits with five reaching number one.[2] He was inducted into the Kentucky Music Hall of Fame in 2015 and is an alumnus of Morehead State University's hall of fame.[2] Beyond his solo work, Cordle has been featured on bluegrass tribute albums for the British rock band the Moody Blues (2004 and 2011) and continues to record and tour actively with Lonesome Standard Time while maintaining his independent songwriting company, Wandachord Music, BMI.[4][5]
