## Biography
Julian Clifton "Matty" Matlock (April 27, 1907 – June 14, 1978) was an American Dixieland jazz clarinettist, saxophonist, and arranger born in Paducah, Kentucky. He began playing clarinet at age 12 and made his recording debut in 1928 with Jimmy Joy in Chicago. In October 1929, at just 22 years old, Matlock joined the Ben Pollack Orchestra as a replacement for the legendary Benny Goodman, where he performed clarinet, alto saxophone, and developed his arranging skills by studying under the influence of Fud Livingston. During his five years with Pollack (1929-1934), he formed lifelong friendships with musicians including Eddie Miller, Nappy LaMare, and Gil Rodin.

Matlock's most significant contribution to jazz came through his work with Bob Crosby's orchestra beginning in 1935, where he served as both clarinettist and primary arranger until the band dissolved in 1942. He was instrumental in perfecting the sound of "arranged white Dixieland," earning recognition in *The Rough Guide to Jazz* as "the most inspired and spontaneous clarinettist in the Dixieland style" alongside Irving Fazola. After relocating to Los Angeles during World War II, Matlock transitioned from touring musician to studio professional, allowing him to remain close to his family while maintaining an active career in Hollywood's booming entertainment industry.

Throughout the 1940s and 1950s, Matlock worked extensively as a session musician and arranger, collaborating with major artists including Bing Crosby, Louis Armstrong, Ella Fitzgerald, and Judy Garland. He appeared in the 1955 film *Pete Kelly's Blues* and recorded numerous albums as bandleader, including *The Dixieland Story* (1958) and recordings with the Kings of Dixieland. Matlock's legacy rests on his dual mastery of clarinet performance and orchestral arrangement, establishing him as a defining figure in Dixieland jazz during the swing era.
