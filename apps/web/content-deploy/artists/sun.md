## Biography
Derek Ryan Smith, known professionally as Mod Sun, was born on March 10, 1987, in Bloomington, Minnesota. Growing up immersed in the local pop punk scene, his mother encouraged him to attend concerts and invite touring bands to stay at their house, fostering early connections; by eighth grade, he was designing merchandise for bands, and in his teens, he became influenced by New Jersey and Drive-Thru Records emo acts, shaping his fashion and musical interests.[1][3] He began his music career in high school, drumming for pop punk band Sideline Heroes, then The Semester for four years until being kicked out post-graduation, followed by stints with post-hardcore bands Four Letter Lie (2004-2009) and Scary Kids Scaring Kids as drummer and drum tech.[1][2][4]

Transitioning to a solo rap career in 2009 under the name Mod Sun, he developed a 'hippy hop' style, releasing five mixtapes, three EPs, and five studio albums, including his debut *Look Up* (2015) which topped Billboard's Top Heatseekers chart. His career evolved with collaborations in alternative hip hop duo Hotel Motel, and a stylistic shift back to pop punk on his fourth album *Internet Killed the Rockstar* (2021), continuing with *God Save the Teen* (2023).[1][3] He has also ventured into poetry books, film (co-directing Machine Gun Kelly's *Downfalls High*), and sobriety, embracing the Gen-Z pop punk revival.[2][4]

Mod Sun's legacy blends punk roots with hip hop innovation, influencing younger artists through mentorship and production, while his resilient journey from band dismissals and substance struggles to chart success cements his role as a pop punk consultant for new generations.[2][5]
