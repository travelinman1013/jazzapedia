## Biography
Los Guanches is a musical group from Santiago de Cuba, specializing in **son cubano**, a traditional Cuban genre blending Spanish musical structures with Afro-Cuban and indigenous elements that gained international prominence from the 1930s onward. Emerging from the rich musical tradition of eastern Cuba, the group embodies the fusion of rural and urban rumba styles that developed in Havana during the late 19th century, contributing to the evolution of son as a cornerstone of Cuban music. Their work reflects the semi-professional son groups common in Havana's neighborhoods during the early 20th century, adapted to Santiago's vibrant local scene.[2][1]

The group's career highlights include the 2007 remastered album *Mi Son Cubano*, featuring 14 tracks that showcase classic son interpretations, and recordings captured in Santiago de Cuba for projects like the Floridita 'Santiago Son' CD. Active in preserving traditional son cubano, often styled in guajira vocal mixes reminiscent of Buena Vista Social Club, Los Guanches perform timeless pieces such as 'La Negra Que Yo...' and 'La Sitiera' by trovador Manuel Corona. Their music upholds the genre's characteristic clave rhythm, syncopated tumbao, and montuno ostinatos, maintaining a legacy tied to Cuba's cultural heritage amid low modern popularity (Spotify score of 5).[3][4][5][6][8]

Though specific details on their formation and peak activity remain limited in available sources, Los Guanches represent the enduring spirit of santiaguero musicians who elevate Cuban sonorities globally, bridging historical son sextetos of the 1920s with contemporary remasterings.
