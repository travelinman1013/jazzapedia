## Biography
Danny Gatton, born Daniel Wood Gatton Jr. on September 4, 1945, in Washington, D.C., grew up in a musical family with his father, Daniel W. Gatton Sr., a rhythm guitarist who prioritized family stability over a performing career. Starting guitar at age nine, inspired by Les Paul and Hank Garland, Gatton joined his first band, The Offbeats, at 12 in 1959, playing with them until 1967 and reuniting later as American Music Company. He worked as a sheet metal worker, married Jan at 21, and became known for repairing instruments while immersing himself in the D.C. music scene, blending blues, country, bebop, rockabilly, and jazz on guitars like his customized 1953 Telecaster and 1956 Gibson ES-350.[1][2][3][4]
