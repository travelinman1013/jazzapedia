## Biography
Grupo Afro-Cubano, also known as Grupo Afro-Cubano de Alberto Zayas or Grupo Afrocubano Lulú Yonkori, was a Cuban musical ensemble active in the 1950s, specializing in Afro-Cuban rhythms such as guaguancó. Emerging during a vibrant era of Afro-Cuban folkloric music in Cuba, the group contributed to the popularization of traditional drumming, singing, and dance rooted in African diasporic traditions brought to the island by enslaved people. Their work aligned with the broader afrocubanismo movement, which celebrated African cultural elements in Cuban music from the 1920s to 1940s, influencing genres like son and rumba.[7][8]

The group's career developed amid Cuba's rich folkloric scene in Matanzas and Havana, where similar ensembles preserved Yoruba, Arará, Congo, and other African-derived styles. While specific details on their formation and key recordings are limited, they performed during the peak of mambo and rumba popularity, sharing stages and influences with contemporaries like Machito and his Afro-Cubans. Their music featured rhythmic complexity and cultural authenticity, reflecting the evolution of Afro-Cuban traditions into modern expressions.[1][4][7]

Though less documented than larger bands, Grupo Afro-Cubano's legacy endures as part of Cuba's Afro-Cuban musical heritage, influencing later folkloric groups focused on ritualistic drumming and dance. Their contributions helped maintain ancestral traditions amid commercialization, paving the way for international recognition of Cuban rhythms in the post-revolutionary era.[3][4]
