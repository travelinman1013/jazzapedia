## Biography
Gene Chandler, born Eugene Drake Dixon on July 6, 1940, in Chicago, Illinois, grew up on the city's South Side and attended Englewood High School. He began his musical journey in the early 1950s by forming the Gaytones in 1955 and later joined the doo-wop group the Dukays in 1957, becoming their lead singer after serving in the U.S. Army in Germany. Returning to Chicago in 1960, he recorded with the Dukays on Nat Records, including 'Nite Owl,' but his breakthrough came with 'Duke of Earl' in 1962 on Vee-Jay Records, which topped the Billboard Hot 100 and earned him the nickname 'The Duke of Earl.'[3][1][2]

Chandler's career evolved across genres, achieving chart success in doo-wop, R&B, soul, and disco from 1961 to 1986. After leaving Vee-Jay in 1963, he signed with Constellation Records, scoring Top-20 hits like 'Just Be True' and 'Nothing Can Stop Me' (both written by Curtis Mayfield and produced by Carl Davis). He later recorded for Chess, Brunswick, and Mercury, with 'Groovy Situation' in 1970 reaching #12 on the Hot 100 and #8 on R&B charts, selling over a million copies. In the 1970s, he founded labels Mr. Chand and Bamboo, produced acts like Mel and Tim, dueted with Barbara Acklin and Jerry Butler, and ventured into disco under Carl Davis, popular in the UK.[3][1][6]

Chandler transitioned into production and executive roles, becoming executive vice-president of Chi-Sound and continuing associations with Curtis Mayfield. Despite personal challenges including drug involvement and a brief jail stint in 1976, he earned a Grammy Hall of Fame induction, Rhythm and Blues Foundation Pioneer Award, and double induction into the R&B Music Hall of Fame in 2014 and 2016 as a performer and pioneer.[3][1]
