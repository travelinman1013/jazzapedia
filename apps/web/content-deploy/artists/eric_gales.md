## Biography
Eric Gales, born and raised in Memphis, Tennessee, grew up in a musical family with four brothers, two of whom—Eugene and Manuel—taught him guitar from age four. A right-handed player who adopted a left-handed, upside-down style imitating his brothers, Gales emerged as a child prodigy, releasing his debut album, The Eric Gales Band, on Elektra Records at just 16 in 1991. Named Guitar World’s 'Best New Talent' that year, he blended blues-rock with influences from Stevie Ray Vaughan, Eric Johnson, Albert King, and Jimi Hendrix, distinguishing himself as a rare young Black guitarist in the genre during the grunge era.[1][2][3][5][7][8]

His career evolved through family collaborations like the Gales Bros. with Eugene and Manuel on 1996’s Left Hand Brand, and standout moments such as joining Carlos Santana at Woodstock '94 and performing on the Experience Hendrix Tour in 2004. After personal struggles including incarceration, where he formed a prison band, Gales staged a remarkable comeback with albums like 2001’s That’s What I Am on Nightbird Records, 2017’s Middle of the Road (featuring Gary Clark Jr. and Lauryn Hill), and the Billboard #1 2019 release The Bookends, produced with wife LaDonna Gales and Matt Wallace. Over 30 years, he has released 18 solo albums plus numerous tributes, pushing blues into modern funk-rock territory.[1][3][6][7]

Gales’ legacy endures as a virtuoso blending explosive solos, emotive vocals, and innovative songwriting, often hailed as a Hendrix successor while forging a unique hybrid sound. His relentless output, including supergroups like Pinnick Gales Pridgen (2013), and signature gear like his Two Rock amp, cement his influence on contemporary blues-rock.[1][2][6][7]
