## Biography
Jonathan Michael Richman was born on May 16, 1951, in Boston, Massachusetts, and grew up in Natick, where he attended public schools and graduated from Natick High in 1969. Influenced by The Velvet Underground, he began writing songs in the mid-1960s and formed the proto-punk garage rock band The Modern Lovers in Boston in 1970 at age 19, with early members including next-door neighbor John Felice, keyboardist Jerry Harrison, and drummer David Robinson.[1][2][5] In 1972, the band recorded seminal demos like 'Roadrunner' and 'Pablo Picasso' with producer John Cale, but Richman grew dissatisfied with the harder electric sound, leading to the original lineup's disbandment by late 1973 despite no major label release at the time.[1][3]

By 1975, Richman had moved to California for a solo phase before reforming Jonathan Richman and the Modern Lovers in 1976 with David Robinson, bassist Greg 'Curly' Keranen, and guitarist Leroy Radcliffe, shifting to a gentler, acoustic style rooted in 1950s rock and roll, pop harmonies, and global folk influences.[1][2][3] Key albums included *Rock 'n' Roll with the Modern Lovers* (1977), featuring the UK hit 'Egyptian Reggae,' *Modern Lovers Live* (1978), and *Modern Lovers '88* (1988), after which he retired the band name and continued solo or with varying lineups.[1][3] His wide-eyed, childlike outlook and minimalist rock defined his evolution from proto-punk pioneer to eclectic singer-songwriter.[1]

Richman's legacy as a proto-punk influencer endures through *The Modern Lovers* (1976), a posthumous release of 1972 demos that bridged garage rock and punk, while his later work inspired admiration for its joyful minimalism and rejection of rock's excesses, maintaining a cult following into the 1980s and beyond with albums like *Jonathan Sings!* (1983).[1][3][4]

## Fun Facts
- Richman wrote a letter to Creem magazine in 1973 criticizing rock trends, just before the original Modern Lovers broke up and lost their record deal.[4]
- 'Egyptian Reggae' reached #5 on the UK charts in 1977, becoming one of his biggest hits despite his shift to gentler music.[3]
- The band's 1972 demos with John Cale were rejected by Warner Bros.; they were released as *The Modern Lovers* in 1976, two years after disbandment.[1]
- Richman scrapped early recordings after a Bermuda residency inspired a mellower sound, leading to the original band's demise.[1]
