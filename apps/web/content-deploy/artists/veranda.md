## Biography
Veranda is a Francophone folk, country, and bluegrass duo formed in 2018 in Montreal, Quebec, consisting of actress and singer Catherine-Audrey Lachapelle and multi-instrumentalist Léandre Joly-Pelletier. The pair met at Barfly, Montreal's bluegrass hub, during open mics dedicated to bluegrass and old-time country music on Sunday nights, sparking their collaboration. Lachapelle, known for her long-standing role in Radio-Canada’s hit TV series 'District 31' and a 2016 nomination for Best Actress in a Supporting Role at the Gala Québec Cinema, balanced her rising acting career with her passion for music, leading her to partner with Joly-Pelletier.[1][2][7]

Their career took off with two well-received EPs, including 'Yodel Bleu' in 2020, followed by their debut full-length album 'Là-Bas' in fall 2022, featuring nature-inspired tracks blending traditional and contemporary bluegrass with sweet harmonies and soulful melodies. Influenced by the Appalachian sound, they draw from the outdoors, splitting time between Montreal and a home near Rivière-Rouge by Parc National du Mont-Tremblant during the pandemic, which shaped their songwriting on themes of nature, human loneliness, and Quebec folklore. The album was recorded at Montréal’s Treatment Room, showcasing their virtuosity akin to Alison Krauss & Union Station and Old Crow Medicine Show.[1][2]

Veranda's musical style fuses high lonesome bluegrass, intimate folk ballads, and modern elements, performed in French with a distinct Quebecois twist on American roots traditions. They toured Quebec, Western Canada, and the Yukon to support 'Là-Bas,' prioritizing live shows on the road over studio work, and continue to build their legacy as innovators in Quebec's bluegrass scene with three albums total, including latest single 'La Visite'.[1][2]
