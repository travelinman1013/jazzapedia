## Biography
Sister Sledge is an American R&B and soul vocal group formed in 1965 in Philadelphia by four sisters: Debbie (born 1950s), Joni (1956–2017), Kim, and Kathy Sledge (born January 6, 1959). Vocally trained by their grandmother, opera singer Viola Williams, they began performing at their family's church, Williams Temple Christian Methodist Episcopal, and local clubs as 'The Sledge Sisters' or 'Mrs. Williams’ Granddaughters.' Their father, Edwin Sledge, was a tap dancer who broke racial barriers on Broadway, while their mother, Florez Sledge, managed the group. They debuted in 1971 with the single 'Time Will Tell' on Money Back Records, then signed with Atco Records in 1972, releasing early hits like 'Mama Never Told Me' (UK Top 20) and 'Love Don't You Go Through No Changes on Me' (1974), and their debut album *Circle of Love* (1975).[1][3][7]

The group's career peaked in the late 1970s with their move to Cotillion Records and collaboration with Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards of Chic, producing the iconic album *We Are Family* (1979), featuring the global anthem 'We Are Family' and 'He's the Greatest Dancer.' This disco and Philly soul era brought massive success, with over 20 million records sold worldwide, Grammy nominations, and performances at events like Zaire '74. Subsequent albums like *Love Somebody Today* (1980) continued their hits, though later works like *All American Girls* (1981) had moderate success. Kathy left for a solo career in 1989, releasing *Heart* (1992), but rejoined for tours and events like the 2000 White House performance and post-9/11 charity 'We Are Family' remake.[1][3][5][6]

Challenges included lineup changes—Kathy's departures, Kim's focus on ministry (ordained minister, left 2000 and 2019), Joni's death in 2017—and internal disputes leading to Sister Sledge LLC formation (2006) and a 2012 lawsuit against Warner Music settled favorably. Their legacy endures with 'We Are Family' inducted into the Library of Congress (2017), continued touring (now with Camille Sledge), and recognition as disco/Philly soul pioneers.[1][3][5]
