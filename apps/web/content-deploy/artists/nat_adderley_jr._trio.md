## Biography
Nat Adderley Jr., born Nathaniel Adderley Jr. on May 23, 1955, in Quincy, Florida, to jazz cornetist Nat Adderley Sr. and Ann James, grew up immersed in music as the son of a famed jazz musician and nephew of alto saxophonist Cannonball Adderley. His family moved to Teaneck, New Jersey, when he was five, where he developed his skills as a pianist and composer, graduating from Yale University. Initially drawn to rhythm & blues, influenced by Motown, the Beatles, and Burt Bacharach, he began his professional career in Houston, Texas, arranging for Luther Vandross's breakthrough 1981 album *Never Too Much*.[2][3][6]

Over 25 years (1981–2005), Adderley Jr. served as Vandross's music director, arranger, and co-songwriter, contributing hits like 'Stop to Love,' 'Wait for Love,' and the Grammy-nominated 'Give Me the Reason,' while arranging classics such as 'So Amazing' and 'Never Too Much.' Following Vandross's death in 2005, he returned to his jazz roots, performing with the Nat Adderley Jr. Quartet or Trio in venues across New York, New Jersey, China, and Singapore. His debut jazz album as a leader, *Took So Long*, was released on October 14, 2025, on his NAJ label, featuring covers and an original track showcasing his improvisational piano style blended with R&B arranging prowess.[2][4][5]

Adderley Jr.'s musical style fuses R&B, soul, jazz, and blues, marked by rhythmic piano flurries, bold tones, and improvisational growth. Now stepping into his family's jazz legacy, he continues performing and producing, emphasizing live improvisation after decades of structured R&B performances.[2][4]
