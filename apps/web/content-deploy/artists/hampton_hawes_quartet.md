## Biography
Hampton Barnett Hawes Jr. was born on November 13, 1928, in Los Angeles, California, into a musical family; his father was a Presbyterian minister, and his mother played piano for the church. Self-taught by listening to 1930s jazz piano records, Hawes began playing professionally while attending Polytechnic High School, influenced heavily by the bebop revolution sparked by Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie's 1945 appearance in Los Angeles. He jammed at the Finale Club with Parker, Howard McGhee, Sonny Criss, and others, made his first recording in 1947 with Dexter Gordon and Wardell Gray, and worked with Shorty Rogers and at the Lighthouse Club before serving in the U.S. Army in Japan from 1952 to 1954.[1][2][6]

After his discharge, Hawes formed a trio with bassist Red Mitchell and drummer Chuck Thompson, recording acclaimed sessions for Contemporary Records in 1955 that became benchmarks of West Coast jazz; the group expanded to a quartet with guitarist Jim Hall for the innovative All Night Session! album in 1956. His style blended bebop precision with a clean articulation inspired by Parker and Bud Powell, Oscar Peterson phrases, a locked-hands technique, rapid runs, and bluesy grooves that influenced the 'rhythm school' and hard bop, earning him praise as a swinging, versatile pianist. However, heroin addiction led to a 1958 federal narcotics conviction and a five-year prison sentence, from which he was dramatically pardoned by President John F. Kennedy in 1963 after submitting a list of influential jazz musicians supporting his release.[1][2][3][4][7]

Post-release, Hawes resumed recording prolifically in the mid-1960s, including the 1965 trio album Here and Now! with Chuck Israels and Donald Bailey, and later Prestige albums culminating in a 1973 Montreux Jazz Festival performance. He authored the memoir Raise Up Off Me and remained a key figure in mainstream jazz until his death on May 22, 1977, leaving a legacy as an underrated bebop master who bridged West Coast cool and hard-driving swing despite personal struggles.[2][3][5][7][8]
