## Biography
The Bluebells are a Scottish indie new wave band formed in 1981 in Glasgow, Scotland, known for their jangly guitar-based pop similar to contemporaries Aztec Camera and Orange Juice. Founded by guitarist Bobby Bluebell (real name Robert Anthony Hodgens, born 6 June 1959 in Scotland, from a Scottish/Italian family in Glasgow), the core lineup included brothers Ken McCluskey (vocals/harmonica, born 8 February 1962 in Hamilton) and David McCluskey (drums, born 13 January 1964 in Hamilton), with early bassist Lawrence Donegan (born 13 July 1961 in Stirling). They achieved three UK Top 40 hits—'I'm Falling', 'Cath', and 'Young at Heart' (co-written with Siobhan Fahey of Bananarama and violinist Bobby Valentino)—releasing the EP *The Bluebells* and album *Sisters* before splitting in the mid-1980s.[1][2][5]

'Young at Heart' reached No. 8 in 1984 but topped the UK charts for four weeks in 1993 after featuring in a Volkswagen ad, prompting a temporary reunion for *Top of the Pops* and the compilation *The Singles Collection* (No. 27 UK Albums). The band reformed sporadically, including shows supporting Edwyn Collins in 2009, Southside Festival in 2011, BBC Scotland's *The Quay Sessions* in 2018, and a *Still Game* cameo in 2019, with recent activity in 2023. Producers like Elvis Costello mentored them early on, shaping their sound during whirlwind 1980s success.[1][2][3][8]

Post-split, members stayed music-adjacent: Lawrence Donegan joined Lloyd Cole and the Commotions then became *The Guardian*'s golf correspondent; Ken and David formed the McCluskey Brothers folk duo; Bobby Bluebell formed Up and released *The Bluebells In The 21st Century*; Craig Gannon (later guitarist) toured with The Smiths and joined The Adult Net. Their legacy endures through 'Young at Heart's' revival and occasional performances.[1][3][5]

## Fun Facts
- Lawrence Donegan claimed the band encountered an up-and-coming Madonna at a 1984 Los Angeles talent contest, where she blew cigarette smoke in their faces and called them 'losers'.[3]
- Bobby Bluebell chose his stage name early, inspired by a hit record, which became prophetic when the band's single charted at No. 5.[4]
- Clare Grogan’s sister’s version of 'Young at Heart' was selected for the pivotal 1993 Volkswagen ad that revived the song.[4]
- The band once supported The Psychedelic Furs at a gig with no sound system or spare strings, turning it into a chaotic learning experience.[4]
