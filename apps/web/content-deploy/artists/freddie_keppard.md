## Biography
Freddie Keppard (February 27, 1890 – July 15, 1933) was an American jazz cornetist born in New Orleans, Louisiana, who rose to prominence in the city's vibrant early jazz scene. As a teenager, he played violin, mandolin, and accordion before switching to cornet around age 16. By 1905, he organized the Olympia Orchestra, featuring musicians like Alphonse Picou on clarinet and later his brother Louis Keppard on guitar, blending 'legitimate' society music with hot jazz for diverse gigs. Succeeding Buddy Bolden, Keppard earned the title 'King Keppard' as New Orleans' top horn player for emulating Bolden's popular style, performing at clubs like Pete Lala’s and with Frankie Dusen's Eagle Band.[1][2][8]

In 1913-1914, Keppard joined Bill Johnson's Original Creole Orchestra, a pioneering Creole band that toured the Orpheum Theatre circuit from San Francisco to Chicago, New York, and Canada, introducing New Orleans jazz to wider audiences before the genre was widely named. Famously, in 1915, the band declined a recording offer from Victor Talking Machine Company due to Keppard's fear of copycats—a decision that allowed the all-white Original Dixieland Jazz Band to make the first jazz records instead. Settling in Chicago around 1917-1918 amid personal challenges like heavy drinking, Keppard became a fixture in the local scene, working with bands led by Jimmie Noone, Johnny Dodds, Erskine Tate, Doc Cook, Lil Hardin Armstrong, and others. He recorded from 1923-1927, including with his Jazz Cardinals, Erskine Tate's Vendome Orchestra, and Doc Cook's Orchestra, often on second cornet in demanding two-cornet setups.[1][2][3][4]

Keppard's style retained the raw power of early New Orleans jazz, though health issues and alcohol curtailed his career by 1931. Despite not achieving recording fame earlier, his technical prowess and role in spreading jazz earned lasting recognition as a foundational figure overshadowed by successors like King Oliver and Louis Armstrong. He died in Chicago at age 43.[1][6]

## Fun Facts
- Keppard's Original Creole Orchestra was offered the first jazz recording contract in 1915 by Victor but declined because he feared others would steal his ideas, paving the way for the Original Dixieland Jazz Band's hit 'Livery Stable Blues'.[1][2]
- King Oliver reportedly 'blew Keppard down' by thrusting his horn out a window to attract crowds upon arriving in Chicago, dethroning him as the local cornet king.[1]
- Keppard briefly played in King Oliver’s band in Chicago around 1920, putting two 'Kings' on stage together.[4]
- As a Creole musician, Keppard's Olympia Orchestra balanced refined society gigs with hot jazz at uptown halls, showcasing versatility.[1]
