## Biography
Ralph Castelli, born in Alaska around 1998 (Gemini), grew up in Anchorage surrounded by music due to his musician parents, who inspired his early passion. He began making music in the woods of his native state, starting at age 8 when his father gifted him an electric guitar, and by age six in some accounts showed interest in instruments. At 18, he moved to Australia to study composition and production at the Australian Institute of Music, initially creating DIY bedroom pop in a solo project using only self-recorded sounds, no samples. His early releases include the debut EP 'Ralph Castelli' in September 2017 and single 'If I Could Play the Piano' in October 2017.[1][3][5][9]

Settling in Los Angeles, Castelli developed his signature synth-heavy bedroom pop blending alternative pop, hip-hop, electronic elements, falsetto vocals, and muted beats, influenced by Sufjan Stevens and Radiohead. He transitioned from solo artist to acclaimed producer for indie acts like The Neighbourhood's Jesse Rutherford, Blu DeTiger, Dora Jar, Glaive, Deb Never, Spill Tab, and Jany Green, with work featured in Samsung, EOS campaigns, and Fortnite. Hits like 'Morning Sex' gained TikTok traction (over 44,000 videos). By around 2025 (age 27), he relocated to Hope, Alaska, building a home, guest cabins, and studios from scratch amid becoming a father to daughter Iris, facing addiction, and crafting the vulnerable 12-track album 'Hope, Alaska,' reflecting familial changes, love, nature, and personal struggles with comforting melodies.[2][4][7]

Castelli's legacy lies in his DIY ethos, multi-instrumentalist versatility (guitar, production), and evolution from intimate bedroom recordings to shaping indie sounds while returning to raw, personal artistry rooted in Alaskan isolation.
