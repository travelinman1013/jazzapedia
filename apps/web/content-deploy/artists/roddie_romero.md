## Biography
Roddie Romero, born and raised in Lafayette, Louisiana's rural Southside, developed his musical talent from a young age immersed in Cajun and Zydeco culture. At family gatherings, his grandfather played accordion, inspiring nine-year-old Romero to pick up the instrument and teach himself, quickly emerging as a child prodigy. Despite being underage, he began performing professionally in Louisiana juke joints while in high school, leading to the passage of the 'Roddie Romero Bill' in 1992, which allowed minors to perform in bars with a parent or guardian.[1][2][3]

By high school graduation, Romero had recorded three albums, one reaching #1 in the Netherlands, toured the U.S. and Canada multiple times, and appeared at major festivals. A pivotal moment came in his late teens at the Montreal Jazz Festival, where he discovered slide guitar during Sonny Landreth's soundcheck, expanding his style beyond accordion to blend Cajun, Zydeco, blues, swamp pop, soul, and rock. He formed Roddie Romero & the Hub City All Stars, teaming with pianist Eric Adcock, and released acclaimed albums like *The La Louisianne Sessions* (2008, Grammy-nominated) and *Gulfstream* (2016, Grammy-nominated), earning three Grammy nominations overall.[1][2][3][5]

Romero's signature South Louisiana sound features soulful vocals, masterful accordion, and slide guitar, authentically capturing Acadiana's spirit while innovating through original songwriting. The band has toured internationally for over 20 years, performing at prestigious festivals and solidifying Romero's legacy as a key figure in Louisiana roots music.[1][3][5][6]
