## Biography
Boniface Ferdinand Leonard 'Buddy' DeFranco was born on February 17, 1923, in Camden, New Jersey, to a poor Italian-American immigrant family, and raised in South Philadelphia. His blind father, an amateur guitarist and piano tuner, encouraged his musical interest; DeFranco started clarinet at age nine under teacher Virgil 'Happy' Cotrill, who emphasized classical technique alongside jazz influences from Benny Goodman and Artie Shaw. By 14, he won a national Tommy Dorsey Swing contest and performed with Gene Krupa on Saturday Night Swing Club, launching his professional career in 1939 with Johnny 'Scat' Davis's band, followed by stints with Gene Krupa (1941), Charlie Barnet (1942-43), and Tommy Dorsey (1944).[1][2][3][4][6]

DeFranco pioneered bebop on clarinet amid swing's decline, drawing from Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie to adapt the instrument to modern jazz. In 1950, he joined Count Basie's septet; led quartets in the early 1950s with Sonny Clark, Tal Farlow, Art Blakey, Kenny Drew, and later Tommy Gumina for polytonal experiments (1950s-early 1960s); toured with Billie Holiday (1954) and Jazz at the Philharmonic; and directed the Glenn Miller Orchestra (1966-1974). He recorded for MGM, Norgran, Verve, and others, earning 20 DownBeat, 9 Metronome, and 16 Playboy awards as top jazz clarinetist, known for technical brilliance, improvisational virtuosity, and warm tone.[1][2][3][4]

Settling in Panama City, Florida, DeFranco continued touring, teaching clinics (e.g., Stan Kenton, North Texas), and recording into his 80s with Terry Gibbs and Arbors label, bridging swing to bebop and influencing generations until his death on December 24, 2014, at age 91.[1][2][3]
