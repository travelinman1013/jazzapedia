## Biography
Stayve Jerome Thomas, better known as **Slim Thug**, was born on September 8, 1980, in Houston, Texas, where he was raised on the Northside amid humble beginnings. Witnessing his mother's multiple jobs inspired his drive for success, leading him to develop freestyle rapping skills early on. At age 17, he performed at local high school parties, catching the attention of DJ Michael “5000” Watts, which landed him a spot on the “Swisha House 98” mixtape and kickstarting his career in the late 1990s with Swishahouse[3][4][5].

Recognizing the potential in independence, Slim Thug parted ways amicably with Swishahouse to form his own label, Boss Hogg Outlawz (BHO), distributing his own mixtapes and signing collaborators like E.S.G. His mainstream breakthrough came with the 2004 guest verse on Mike Jones' 'Still Tippin'' alongside Paul Wall, peaking at #60 on the Billboard Hot 100. In 2005, he signed with Pharrell Williams' Star Trak and Interscope, releasing his debut album *Already Platinum*, followed by hits like 'Check On It' with Beyoncé, earning an MTV VMA. His style embodies **southern hip hop**, with a boss persona reflecting Houston's streetwise hustle[3][4][5][7].

Slim Thug has sustained a prolific career through mixtape series like 'Serve & Collect' and 'Thug Thursday,' albums such as *Boss of All Bosses* (2009) and *Boss Life*, while expanding into business ventures including record stores, real estate, Boss Life Cigars, and clothing. Standing at 6'6", his towering presence and entrepreneurial mindset have cemented his legacy as the 'Big Boss of the South' and North Houston, mentoring new Houston artists and remaining independent[3][4][5].
