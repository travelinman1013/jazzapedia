## Biography
Larry Coryell, born Lorenz Albert Van DeLinder III on April 2, 1943, in Galveston, Texas, and raised in the Seattle, Washington area, began his musical journey at age four with piano before switching to guitar in his teens, immersing himself in rock music influenced by Chet Atkins and Chuck Berry. He studied journalism at the University of Washington while taking private guitar lessons, then relocated to New York City in 1965 for classical guitar studies. His early career included replacing Gábor Szabó in Chico Hamilton's quintet, forming the psychedelic jazz-rock band The Free Spirits in 1966 with Jim Pepper, and joining Gary Burton's quartet, contributing to the seminal album *Duster* (1967). Coryell pioneered jazz fusion by blending jazz, rock, psychedelia, and country elements, earning the title 'godfather of fusion' for albums like *Spaces* (1969) with John McLaughlin.[1][2][3]

In the 1970s, Coryell led groups like Foreplay (with childhood friend Mike Mandel) and The Eleventh House (with Alphonse Mouzon), releasing influential fusion albums amid the rise of peers like the Mahavishnu Orchestra. He collaborated across genres, including with Herbie Mann on *Memphis Underground* (1968) and Lenny White on *Venusian Summer* (1975), trading solos with Al Di Meola. As fusion intensified competitively, Coryell shifted to acoustic guitar in the late 1970s, inspired by Philip Catherine's introduction to Django Reinhardt's 'Nuages,' recording duets and classical works like Vivaldi's *The Four Seasons* with Kazuhito Yamashita (1984). He balanced electric fusion, straight jazz, and education, writing for *Guitar Player* magazine.[1][2][3]

Coryell's later career featured tours with Roman Miroshnichenko from 2008 and pianist John Colianni from 2010, alongside his final album *Barefoot Man: Sanpaku* (2016) using his Gibson Super 400 and custom Martin acoustic. He passed away on February 19, 2017, leaving a legacy as a versatile innovator whose work bridged rock and jazz, influencing generations despite not achieving mainstream commercial fame.[1][2][3]

## Fun Facts
- Coryell declined Tony Williams' invitation to join Lifetime in 1969, recommending John McLaughlin instead, which propelled McLaughlin to Miles Davis' band and fusion stardom.
- He recorded a Japan-only guitar duo of Vivaldi's *The Four Seasons* with 19-year-old classical prodigy Kazuhito Yamashita in 1984, marveling at the young guitarist's skill.
- His 1966 band The Free Spirits was radio-friendly psychedelic but foreshadowed fusion with complex solos by Coryell and Jim Pepper.
- Coryell's final 2016 album *Barefoot Man: Sanpaku* used only his Gibson Super 400 electric and custom Martin acoustic prototype.
