## Biography
Mark Lavon 'Levon' Helm was born on May 26, 1940, in Phillips County, Arkansas, near the delta town of Marvell, and grew up in the small community of Turkey Scratch, working on his family's cotton farm. Surrounded by music from his parents, local blues on the radio like Sonny Boy Williamson's King Biscuit Time, and live performances including Bill Monroe at age six—which inspired him to pursue music—Helm started playing guitar at eight or nine alongside his sister Linda, then switched to drums after seeing a left-handed drummer in the F.S. Walcott traveling tent show's Midnight Ramble. He formed his first band, the Jungle Bush Beaters, in high school and began performing in local clubs around Helena, witnessing early rock and roll acts like Elvis Presley and Conway Twitty.[1][2][3][4]

## Fun Facts
- Grew up without electricity until age ten, listening to battery-powered radio for blues influences in rural Turkey Scratch.[1][2]
- The Band got their name from the Woodstock, NY community who referred to them as 'the band in town' during Bob Dylan backing gigs.[2][3]
- Diagnosed with throat cancer in 1998, lost his voice temporarily, but regained it to launch Midnight Ramble sessions at his Barn studio, earning three consecutive Grammys for Dirt Farmer (2007), Electric Dirt (2009), and Ramble at the Ryman (2011).[1][2]
- His boyhood home area in Turkey Scratch is listed on the Arkansas Register of Historic Places since 2018.[1]
