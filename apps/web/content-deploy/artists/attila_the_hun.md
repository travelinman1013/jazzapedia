## Biography
Attila the Hun (1892–1962), born Raymond Quevedo, was one of the greatest calypsonians of all time and a pioneering figure in Trinidad's musical and political landscape.[1] Born on March 24, 1892, in Port-of-Spain, Trinidad, to a Venezuelan father and West Indian mother, he received a college education at St. Mary's College and was considered exceptionally brilliant.[3][4] Before launching his singing career in 1911, he worked as a cook aboard ships and as a tally clerk for the Archer Coaling Company.[4] He began performing as a chantwell (lead singer) for a Carnival masquerade band in Port of Spain before transitioning to calypso tents by the 1920s, where he quickly became a popular performer.[1]

Attila distinguished himself as a master of satire and political commentary, earning recognition as one of calypso's most eloquent and observant voices.[1] Along with the Roaring Lion and other calypsonians, he helped establish the Victory Tent and introduced innovations such as calypso duets and calypso dramas.[1] His specialty was political and social commentary, particularly addressing the experiences of working people in colonial Trinidad.[1] Notable compositions include "Graf Zeppelin" (about the German dirigible's visit to Trinidad), "Roosevelt in Trinidad," "Treasury Scandal," and "The Strike" (concerning labor protests).[1] In 1934, he traveled to New York with the Roaring Lion to record for the American Record Company, where they met Rudy Vallee and appeared on his weekly radio broadcast—a historic broadcast that reached Trinidad.[1]
 n
Beyond music, Attila was a fearless activist and the first calypsonian to hold public office.[3] He was elected to the Port-of-Spain City Council in 1946 and later became Deputy Mayor, then was elected to Trinidad's Legislative Council in 1950.[1][3] He used his platform to advocate for equality in the police service regardless of color and class, and boldly protested police censorship of calypso songs that criticized unpopular officials.[2][4] He won the calypso king competition at least six times, with a notable victory in 1950 at Mucurapo Stadium.[2] After his death on February 22, 1962, at age 69, his writings on calypso were compiled into the book *Atilla's Kaiso: A Short History of Trinidad Calypso* (1983), and he was posthumously awarded the Trinidad & Tobago Public Service Medal of Merit Gold in 1972 for his contributions to public service and calypso.[1][3]

## Fun Facts
- Before becoming a legendary calypsonian, Attila worked as a cook aboard ships and as a tally clerk, demonstrating his diverse work experience before his 1911 singing debut.[4]
- In 1950, Attila won the calypso king competition at Mucurapo Stadium with his politically charged song 'Give Up the West Indies, Britain,' which resonated so strongly with the crowd of 3,000 that judges awarded him the victory.[2]
- Attila was remarkably shy regarding publicity and preferred to keep a low profile despite his fame, contrasting sharply with his bold and fearless approach to political activism through song.[4]
- He successfully lobbied for police service equality through calypso activism, prompting Captain A.A. Cipriani to raise discrimination issues with British authorities, resulting in full uniforms for all local officers in the services.[4]
