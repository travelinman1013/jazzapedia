## Biography
Memphis May Fire is an American metalcore band formed in Denton, Texas in December 2006, officially adopting their name in February 2007 after initially performing as "Oh Captain, My Captain."[1][2] The band was founded by original vocalist Chase Ryan, guitarist Ryan Bentley, and bassist Tanner Oakes, and quickly caught the attention of Trustkill Records president Josh Grabelle, signing to the label in September 2007.[1][2] Their debut album Sleepwalking, released in July 2009, established their signature sound—described as "a new breed of rock n' roll" with aggressive guitar work, melodic sensibilities, and distinctive southern swagger.[1][2]

The band's lineup has evolved significantly over their nearly two-decade career, with lead guitarist Kellen McGregor remaining as the sole original member.[1] Current members include lead vocalist Matty Mullins (since 2008), bassist Cory Elder (since 2008), and drummer Jake Garland (since 2010).[1][2] Memphis May Fire has released seven studio albums and two EPs, with their fourth album Unconditional debuting at No. 4 on the US Billboard 200 and topping the Alternative Albums chart.[1] The band's most recent album, Shapeshifter, was released in March 2025.[2] Known for blending metalcore with southern rock influences and post-hardcore elements, Memphis May Fire has maintained a prominent presence in the metalcore scene while evolving their sound from their earlier post-hardcore roots to heavier, more aggressive material in recent years.[1][4]
