## Biography
Allen Toussaint, born January 14, 1938, in New Orleans' Gert Town neighborhood, grew up in a working-class shotgun house and began sneaking into the Dew Drop Inn as a teenager to participate in talent shows, where his piano playing caught attention. His early career took off in 1955 when he substituted for Huey 'Piano' Smith on tour, later joining Earl King's band at the Dew Drop Inn and subbing for Fats Domino in the studio. By 1957, recognizing the limits of gigging, he shifted to studio work, debuting with his own instrumental album featuring 'Java,' which later became a hit for others, sparking his focus on songwriting and production.[1][2][3][4]

In 1960, Toussaint partnered with Joe Banashak at Minit Records as A&R, producer, and arranger, crafting hits for Ernie K-Doe ('Mother-in-Law'), Irma Thomas ('It's Raining'), Aaron Neville, Benny Spellman, and Lee Dorsey ('Ya Ya'). He co-founded Instant Records and, with Marshall Sehorn, built Sea-Saint Studios in 1973, producing funk and soul for The Meters, Dr. John ('Right Place Wrong Time'), LaBelle ('Lady Marmalade'), and others, while releasing solo albums like *From a Whisper to a Scream* and *Southern Nights*. His style blended New Orleans R&B with lush arrangements, piano-driven grooves, and rhythmic innovation, evolving from classic R&B to contemporary funk.[1][2][4][5]

Toussaint's legacy as a New Orleans R&B architect includes co-founding NYNO Records in 1996, charitable efforts like New Orleans Artists Against Hunger and Homelessness with Aaron Neville, and induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998. He remained active until his death on November 9, 2015, influencing global music through productions, songwriting, and performances that bridged R&B, funk, and pop.[1][4][7]
