## Biography
Jimmy Thackery, born James Thackery on May 19, 1953, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and raised in Washington, D.C., developed his blues guitar prowess in the late 1960s by playing in local high school bands and learning directly from blues masters rather than records.[1][4][6] Inspired by guitarists like Buddy Guy and a transformative Jimi Hendrix performance in D.C., he co-founded the Nighthawks with harmonica player Mark Wenner in 1972, a hard-working blues and roots rock band that recorded over 20 albums and toured extensively through the 1970s and 1980s.[2][4][5] Known for his intense, rockin' blues guitar style featuring explosive solos, dynamic note-bending, and powerful riffs, Thackery's early career emphasized live performances and road warrior endurance.[1][3]

In 1986 or 1987, seeking new musical directions and a break from relentless touring, Thackery left the Nighthawks to form the six-piece R&B and funk band the Assassins, recording three albums before their 1991 breakup.[2][3][4] He then launched Jimmy Thackery and the Drivers in 1992, a trio signed to Blind Pig Records, releasing acclaimed albums like *Empty Arms Motel* (1992), *Trouble Man* (1994, produced by Jim Gaines), *Wild Night Out* (1995), *Drive to Survive* (1996), *Switching Gears* (1998), and *Sinner Street* (2000), highlighting his original songwriting and searing guitar work.[2][3][4] Later releases included *We Got It* (2002, Telarc), *In the Natural State* (2006, with Earl and Ernie Cate), *Solid Ice* (2007), and *Spare Keys* (2016).[4]

Thackery's legacy endures as a blues guitar powerhouse, performing nearly 300 shows annually as a solo artist post-Nighthawks, blending blues rock with influences absorbed from decades on the road, and maintaining a home in Belize while delivering emotionally charged performances worldwide.[1][3][9]
