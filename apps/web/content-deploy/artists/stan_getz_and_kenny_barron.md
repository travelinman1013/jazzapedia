## Biography
Stan Getz (1927-1991) and Kenny Barron (born June 9, 1943, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) were two jazz luminaries whose paths converged in the 1980s, culminating in the landmark duet album *People Time* (1991). Getz, born in Philadelphia, emerged as a child prodigy, playing professionally by age 15 in 1942 with bands like Stan Kenton, Jimmy Dorsey, and Benny Goodman; his breakthrough came in Woody Herman’s band, where his lyrical tenor saxophone sound defined cool jazz. Barron, also a Philadelphia native and prodigy, started piano at age 12 with help from Ray Bryant's sister, debuting professionally as a teen with Philly Joe Jones, Jimmy Heath, Yusef Lateef, and his brother Bill Barron; by 19, he joined Dizzy Gillespie’s quintet.[1][2][5][6][8]

Their collaboration began sporadically in 1984, solidifying in 1986 when Barron joined Getz’s quartet with Rufus Reid and Victor Lewis, recording albums like *Voyage* (1986), *Anniversary!* (1987), *Serenity* (1987), and *Bossas & Ballads – The Lost Sessions* (1989). Getz, known for his volatile temperament and battles with addiction (achieving sobriety in 1985), found in Barron a stable, empathetic partner whose ingenious piano work complemented Getz’s emotional, perfectionist style amid his declining health. *People Time*, recorded in March 1991 at Copenhagen’s Jazzhus Montmartre just months before Getz’s death from liver cancer on June 6, 1991, captured their profound duet chemistry, blending cool jazz, bebop, and ballads in a career pinnacle for both.[1][2][5][7]

Barron’s style—lyrical, rhythmic, and versatile—drew from hard bop and bebop influences, while Getz’s velvety tone and melodic improvisation left an indelible legacy in jazz. Their partnership highlighted Barron’s mastery of empathy and energy, elevating Getz’s final performances and cementing Barron’s status as one of jazz’s top pianists, with hundreds of recordings as leader and sideman.[1][2][6]

## Fun Facts
- Both Getz and Barron were Philadelphia-born child prodigies who began professional work at age 15—Getz in 1942.
- *People Time* originated from unamplified duo performances of Benny Carter’s “People Time” during Getz’s quartet tours; it was Getz’s final public performances except one Paris gig.
- Getz once walked out of their 1986 recording session, displeased with his playing, but they later produced classics together.
- During *People Time* sessions, Getz stopped a concert to change his reed and mischievously offered drinks on the house.
