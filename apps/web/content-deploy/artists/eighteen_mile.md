## Biography
Eighteen Mile is a modern bluegrass gospel band formed by five young musicians from the Upstate region of South Carolina, named after Eighteenmile Creek that flows through the area. The band originated as a ministry group, with members performing at churches and nursing homes from a young age, carrying their passion for bluegrass gospel into their college years at Bob Jones University in Greenville, South Carolina. There, influences like Steve Pettit Evangelistic Association—where one member's sister participated—helped nurture their musical roots, blending traditional bluegrass with heartfelt gospel storytelling.[1][2][3]

The band's career advanced when they were produced by Andy Leftwich and signed to an exclusive recording contract with Mountain Home Music Company. Their debut single, 'Above the Clouds,' released in 2025, quickly reached Number 1 on the Bluegrass Gospel chart within a week, showcasing their classic sound and songwriting talent. Band members, including guitarist Jack Ritter and singer Emily (who attended Clemson), draw from deep family traditions of singing in churches, evolving from grassroots ministry to a professional act delivering authentic, small-town bluegrass gospel.[1][2]

Eighteen Mile's musical style fuses traditional bluegrass and gospel with modern sensibilities, emphasizing original songs that connect emotionally with audiences. As a new act on the scene, their rapid chart success and live performances at events like Ivy May's World of Bluegrass signal a promising legacy in preserving and innovating within bluegrass gospel traditions.[1][2][3]
