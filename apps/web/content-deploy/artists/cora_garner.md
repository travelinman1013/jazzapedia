## Biography
Cora Salisbury (also referenced as Cora Garner in some contexts, though primarily known as Cora Salisbury) was a vaudeville pianist and performer active in the early 20th century, particularly around Waukegan, Illinois. Little is known about her early life, but she had prior experience as a vaudeville performer before becoming the band leader and pianist at the Barrison Theater, the top vaudeville house in Waukegan. There, she took a keen interest in young violinist Jack Benny (born Benjamin Kubelsky), serving as a motherly mentor who recognized his potential and encouraged him to join the American Federation of Musicians.[1]
