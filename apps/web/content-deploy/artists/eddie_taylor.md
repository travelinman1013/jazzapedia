## Biography
Eddie Taylor (January 29, 1923 – December 25, 1985) was born in Benoit, Mississippi, where he grew up immersed in the Delta blues tradition. As a child, he was influenced by legendary figures like Charley Patton, Son House, Big Joe Williams, Robert Johnson, and Memphis Minnie, learning guitar from a musician known as 'Popcorn' and teaching his childhood friend Jimmy Reed to play in nearby Leland and Meltonia. Performing in local jukes around Leland and Clarksdale, Taylor moved to Memphis in the 1940s, where he acquired his first electric guitar and played with Joe Hill Lewis, before relocating to Chicago in 1949, bringing his Delta-rooted style to pioneer the post-World War II electric Chicago blues sound.[1][2][3][5]

In Chicago, Taylor became a cornerstone of the blues scene, renowned for his versatile guitar work, impeccable timing, and steady bass lines using thumb and finger picks. He served as the primary accompanist and bandleader for Jimmy Reed on Vee-Jay Records hits like 'You Don't Have to Go,' 'Boogie in the Dark,' and 'Ain't That Loving You Baby?,' after introducing Reed to the label. Taylor also backed John Lee Hooker, Big Walter Horton, Elmore James, Sunnyland Slim, and many others, while releasing his own local hits 'Big Town Playboy' and 'Bad Boy' on Vee-Jay. His solo albums included 'Ready for Eddie' and recordings with Earwig Music like 'Original Chicago Blues.'[1][2][3][7]

Taylor toured extensively in his later career, including the American Blues Legends '74 tour in Europe, festivals in Ann Arbor (1970, 1972), Japan (1977), and the Netherlands (1979), and performances with Roosevelt Sykes in Spain and France (1970). In semi-retirement, he led Peter Dames and the Chicago River Blues Band. Though never a superstar, his musicianship earned him induction into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1987, cementing his legacy as an architect of Chicago blues.[1][2][7]
