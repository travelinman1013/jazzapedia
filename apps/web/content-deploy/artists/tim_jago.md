## Biography
Tim Jago is an Australian guitarist, composer, and educator born in 1983 who has become one of the most sought-after collaborators on the global jazz scene. He began his musical journey in Perth, Western Australia, where he studied at the Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts (WAAPA), completing a Bachelor of Music in Jazz Performance in 2006 and receiving the Melville Toyota Scholarship for the most outstanding final year jazz student. His formative years spent in the outback of Western Australia imprinted vivid memories that would later influence his musical compositions, blending deep jazz tradition with diverse stylistic influences. After graduating, he served as an adjunct guitar tutor at WAAPA from 2007-2010 while building his reputation as a sideman and bandleader in the Australian jazz scene.

In 2010, Jago relocated to the United States to pursue a Master of Music program in Studio Music and Jazz at The University of Miami Frost School of Music, graduating in 2012. Since then, he has performed and recorded extensively with world-class musicians including Terence Blanchard, Dee Dee Bridgewater, Chick Corea, Gloria Estefan, Bobby McFerrin, and Arturo Sandoval. He was a finalist in the inaugural Wes Montgomery International Jazz Guitar Competition in 2015. Jago has maintained a prolific recording career, appearing on Latin GRAMMY-nominated albums and serving as a member of Troy Roberts' long-standing Nu-Jive band across four albums spanning over a decade. Currently based in New York City, he balances a busy sideman performance schedule while having taught at The FROST School of Music and The West Australian Academy of Performing Arts.

Jago's debut album under his own name, *Time Shift*, was released in June 2025 on Bespoke Jazz, marking a significant milestone after fifteen years of co-leading and collaborating on various releases. The album represents a personal reflection of his life experiences and showcases his depth and versatility as a guitarist and composer. Featuring an eclectic program with varied grooves and stylistic influences unified by strong jazz sensibility, *Time Shift* was recorded with a core band that had been working together for over five years, developing what the artist describes as a collective simpatico rarely experienced between musicians.
