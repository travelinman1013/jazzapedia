## Biography
The Village Callers were a pioneering Chicano band from East Los Angeles, formed in the mid-1960s as an evolution from Marcy & The Imperials, led initially by singer, guitarist, and bandleader Marcy Alvarado in the early 1960s. Key members like bassist Joe Espinoza (joined around 1960-61) and saxophonist Adolfo 'Fuzzy' Martinez transitioned from that group, with guitarist Ernie Hernandez suggesting the new name inspired by Willie Bobo's album 'Village Caller.' The band developed a distinctive style fusing R&B, soul, Latin jazz, and heavy Latin percussion—pioneering this blend in the Eastside scene—featuring organ sounds akin to Jimmy Smith, alongside influences from Mongo Santamaria and Willie Bobo. They rehearsed rigorously five days a week, won a Battle of the Bands at East Los Angeles College in 1966 or 1967, and built popularity at venues like the Plush Bunny, Big Union Hall, and Montebello Ballroom.[1][2][3][4]

Under manager Hector Rivera, they caught the attention of Rampart Records producer Eddie Davis, leading to their sole album 'The Village Callers Live' recorded live at the Plush Bunny in 1968, capturing their electrifying energy akin to Trini Lopez's live recordings. Singles followed, including 'Hector' b/w 'The Funky Cypress Hill Shit' (1968), 'Mississippi Delta' b/w 'Hector Part 2' (1968), and 'Evil Ways' b/w 'When You're Gone' (1969, reissued on Bell Records). Lead vocalists included Angie Bell (specializing in Aretha Franklin covers), Ersi Arvisu (later of El Chicano), Al Anaya (later of Thee Midniters), and others, with core lineup featuring Johnny Gonzalez (keyboards/organ), Charles 'Chuck' Masten (congas/sax/percussion), Manny Fernandez (drums/timbales), Charles Lueras (sax), and Fuzzy Martinez (sax).[1][2][3][4]

Personnel changes and challenges led to the band's shift toward rock, renaming to Silvanus and losing their Latin flavor. Members dispersed: Joe Espinoza, Fuzzy Martinez, and Manny Fernandez joined Sal Chico, later forming the enduring Chico Band; others joined Poverty Train, Orange Colored Sky, or Tierra (via drummer Kenny Roman from precursor band). Their legacy endures as one of East LA's finest acts, exemplifying the Eastside Sound with innovative Latin-R&B fusion.[1][3][4]

## Fun Facts

- Their album was recorded live at the Plush Bunny to capture energy like Trini Lopez at PJ's, and they shared a cordial relationship with Pat & Lolly Vegas (later Redbone) at the Haunted House venue.[3]
- Manager Hector Rivera brought Eddie Davis to see them live, leading directly to their Rampart Records deal.[1][2]
