## Biography
Olodum is a renowned Afro-Brazilian bloco-afro and percussion group founded on April 25, 1979, in the Maciel-Pelourinho neighborhood of Salvador, Bahia, Brazil, by percussionist Neguinho do Samba as a leisure option for local residents during carnival. Emerging from the vibrant carnival culture, the group debuted in the 1980 carnival, quickly growing to nearly two thousand members while incorporating historical themes related to African and Brazilian cultures. Neguinho do Samba innovated by blending traditional Brazilian samba with merengue, salsa, and reggae rhythms, pioneering the samba reggae style that defined their sound and became a staple of Bahian Carnival[1][2].

Olodum's career gained momentum with their debut album *Egito Madagáscar* in 1987, featuring the hit 'Faraó,' which honored their African roots and propelled them to national and international fame. The group toured extensively across Europe, Japan, and South America, collaborating with global artists and amplifying Afro-Brazilian percussion worldwide. Their discography includes albums like *Núbia Axum Etiópia* (1989), *Da Atlântida à Bahia* (1991), and *Olodum Pela Vida* (2002), the latter nominated for a Latin Grammy. Beyond music, Olodum functions as a cultural non-governmental organization, offering free percussion classes through projects like Rufar dos Tambores since 1984 and advocating against racism and for human rights[1][2][3].

Olodum's legacy endures as pioneers of samba reggae, influential in globalizing Afro-Brazilian rhythms and maintaining active participation in Salvador's carnival for over four decades. Their social initiatives have empowered local youth, particularly children and teens from Pelourinho, fostering cultural education and community percussion bands[2][3].
