## Biography
Lee Konitz (October 13, 1927 – April 15, 2020) was an American jazz alto saxophonist and composer who became one of the most distinctive voices in cool jazz and a defining figure in modern jazz history. After attending Roosevelt University in Chicago and beginning his professional career at age 12, Konitz joined the Claude Thornhill Orchestra in 1947, where he met arranger Gil Evans and developed crucial early collaborations. In 1948–1950, he participated in Miles Davis's seminal "Birth of the Cool" nonet, which established the cool jazz movement and remains his most celebrated association. Influenced profoundly by pianist Lennie Tristano, Konitz developed a mature style characterized by unorthodox phrasing, chromaticism, and spontaneous improvisation that distinguished him as a leading stylistic alternative to Charlie Parker among modern-jazz alto players.

Throughout his career, Konitz maintained a uniquely varied freelance approach, performing in diverse settings from conventional jazz ensembles to duet and solo performances. After a stint with Stan Kenton's big band (1952–1953), he devoted himself primarily to leading small groups where improvisational freedom could flourish. His partnership with tenor saxophonist Warne Marsh, his fellow student under Tristano, became one of the most enduring and artistically rewarding collaborations in jazz history, spanning from their early Tristano sessions through European tours and recordings in 1975–1976. Konitz remained active and innovative throughout his life, collaborating with musicians across generations—from Charles Mingus and Elvin Jones to Brad Mehldau and Ethan Iverson—and receiving the NEA Jazz Masters Award in 2009. He was voted "Alto Saxophonist of the Year" by Downbeat Magazine Critics Poll in 2010 and won the prestigious Danish JAZZPAR Prize in 1992.

## Fun Facts
- Charlie Parker and Konitz were close friends, not rivals as some jazz critics portrayed them. Parker lent Konitz support on the day Konitz's child was born in Seattle, Washington, while Konitz was stuck in New York City.
- Konitz turned down an opportunity to work with Benny Goodman in 1949, a decision he later regretted.
- In 1976, Konitz performed at the Seven Dials club in Covent Garden, London with Warne Marsh and bassist Peter Ind in a performance so popular the venue was packed to the rafters.
- Konitz's 1961 album Motion was recorded as a spontaneous session consisting entirely of standards with drummer Elvin Jones and bassist Sonny Dallas, showcasing his unorthodox phrasing and chromaticism in a loose trio format.
