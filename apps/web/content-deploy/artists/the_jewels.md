## Biography
The Jewels were an R&B and doo-wop group formed in Washington, D.C. in 1961, though the group's origins trace back to 1958 when members attended Roosevelt High School[3][4]. Originally performing as The Impalas, then The Renaults, and later The Four Jewels, the group consisted of Sandra Bears, Grace Ruffin, Margie Clark, and Carrie Mingo[3][4]. Under the direction of D.C. producer Bob Lee in 1962, they were renamed The Jewels[4]. The group gained early exposure through Bo Diddley, the legendary R&B guitarist who lived in Northeast D.C. and recorded their debut single "I Need You So Much" on Checker Records[3][4]. They performed in Diddley's basement alongside other D.C. talent and recorded multiple singles for various labels including Start Records, Chess, Federal, and King throughout the early 1960s[3][4].

The Jewels achieved their greatest commercial success in 1964 when they signed to Dimension Records and released "Opportunity," which peaked at #64 on the Billboard Hot 100 and climbed to #2 on KRLA 1110[3][4]. Around 1963, Carrie Mingo was replaced by Martha Harvin (later known as Martha High), solidifying the group's classic lineup[3][6]. Beginning in 1965, the group became backing vocalists for James Brown, initially intended for three dates but extending to a full year on the road[4]. They sang background vocals on Brown's notable recordings including "Don't Be a Dropout" (1967) and "Say It Loud, I'm Black and I'm Proud" (1968)[4]. The group disbanded in 1968, though the original members reunited in 1985 to release an album of re-recorded singles titled *Loaded with Goodies*[3]. The Jewels secured their legacy in R&B and doo-wop history, receiving recognition including a Kennedy Center honor in 2008 and being the subject of an award-winning 2012 PBS documentary[4].
