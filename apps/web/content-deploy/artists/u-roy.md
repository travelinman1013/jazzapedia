## Biography
Ewart Beckford, known as U-Roy or the Originator, was born on September 21, 1942, in Jones Town, Kingston, Jamaica. Drawn to music from an early age, he began his career as a deejay at 19 in 1961 on Dickie Wong's Doctor Dickies sound system, later moving to Atomic Sound (Sir George), Coxsone Dodd's system, and Sir Percy before settling at King Tubby's Hometown Hi-Fi. Influenced by pioneers like Count Matchuki and King Stitt, U-Roy developed a melodic toasting style—rhyming and chanting over instrumental B-sides—that popularized the art form, laying groundwork for dub, hip-hop, and rap.[1][2][3]

In 1970, after John Holt recommended him to Duke Reid, U-Roy's singles 'Wake the Town' and 'Wear You to the Ball' on Treasure Isle became massive hits, collected on *Version Galore*. He collaborated with producers like King Tubby, Lee 'Scratch' Perry, Bunny Lee, and Prince Tony Robinson, releasing the international breakthrough *Dread in a Babylon* in 1975. Launching his Stur Gav sound system in 1978, he adapted to dancehall while experimenting across genres, including 2006's *Love Trio in Dub* and 2012's *Pray Fi Di People*, earning the Order of Distinction in 2007. U-Roy passed away on February 17, 2021.[1][2][3]

U-Roy's legacy as the Father of Deejaying stems from his rhythmic, singer-like toasting that revolutionized reggae, influencing global music from roots reggae to hip-hop with heavy bass and break extensions.[1][3]
