## Biography
GA-20 is an American blues band formed in Boston, Massachusetts, in early 2018 by guitarist Matthew Stubbs and vocalist/guitarist Pat Faherty, who bonded over their shared passion for late 1950s and early 1960s Chicago blues, R&B, and rock 'n' roll influences like Lazy Lester, J.B. Lenoir, Earl Hooker, Buddy Guy, Otis Rush, and Junior Wells. Stubbs, a 14-year veteran of Charlie Musselwhite's touring band and performer with James Cotton and John Hammond, started the project during a hiatus from Musselwhite's group while also active in his psych-rock band The Antiguas. Faherty, a regular at Stubbs' local Boston gigs and his former blues guitar student, joined as the core duo, initially rotating musicians including drummer Tim Carman, before solidifying as a bass-less trio emphasizing raw, distorted dual guitars and drums.[1][3][4][6]

The band quickly signed with Colemine Records' Karma Chief imprint in December 2018, releasing their debut single 'Naggin' On My Mind' featuring Charlie Musselwhite on harmonica and Luther Dickinson on slide guitar, followed by their first album *Lonely Soul* in October 2019, which debuted at #2 on the Billboard Blues Chart. Their live EP *GA-20 Live Vol. 1* topped the chart at #1 in 2020, with subsequent releases like *Try It…You Might Like It!* (2021), *Crackdown* (2022), and EPs including *GA-20 Volume 2* (2025) cementing their status as leaders in a traditional blues revival. By 2024, the lineup evolved to Stubbs, vocalist/guitarist Cody Nilsen, and drummer Josh Kiggans, with Nilsen's debut single 'Cryin' & Pleadin'' hitting #1 on B.B. King's Bluesville chart for five weeks in 2025. Nominated for Blues Music Awards (Best Emerging Artist 2022, Blues Band of the Year 2023) and winning Blues Act of the Year at the 2024 New England Music Awards, GA-20's stripped-down, high-energy style using vintage gear like the Gibson GA-20 amplifier has earned critical acclaim for blending timeless rawness with modern edge.[1][2][5][8]

GA-20's legacy lies in spearheading a blues revival, achieving multiple #1 Billboard Blues Chart positions, four Boston Music Awards for Best Blues Act, and international streaming success, all while maintaining an uncompromising focus on primal, song-based electric blues performed in intimate clubs and major festivals.[1][3][5]

## Fun Facts
- The band's name derives from the rare Gibson GA-20 guitar amplifier (1950-1961) that Stubbs used at formation, not Georgia's highway or a shotgun as some initially guessed.
- GA-20 operates as a deliberate bass-less trio, inspired by Hound Dog Taylor's Houserockers, with dual guitars weaving rhythm and lead roles.
- Original vocalist Pat Faherty was Matthew Stubbs' blues guitar student and a regular at his Boston gigs before co-founding the band.
- Their 2020 live EP *GA-20 Live Vol. 1* debuted at #1 on Billboard Blues from obscurity, hailed as 'dirty and raw…timeless and modern' by Medium.com.
