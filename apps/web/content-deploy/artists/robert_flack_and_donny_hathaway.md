## Biography
Roberta Flack & Donny Hathaway refers to the acclaimed musical duo formed by singers Roberta Flack and Donny Hathaway, who met as students at Howard University in Washington, D.C., where Flack studied piano from age 15 and Hathaway played in a jazz trio. Flack, born in Black Mountain, North Carolina, transitioned from piano to voice, becoming assistant conductor of the university choir, while Hathaway, born in Chicago, Illinois, left before graduating to pursue music professionally, working for Curtis Mayfield at Curtom Records. Their careers overlapped on Atlantic Records, with Flack including Hathaway's compositions like 'Our Ages or Our Hearts' on her debut *First Take* (1969) and *Chapter Two* (1970), where he also contributed as pianist, arranger, and background vocalist.

Suggested by Atlantic's Jerry Wexler, they released their debut duet album *Roberta Flack & Donny Hathaway* in 1972, featuring the Grammy-winning hit 'Where Is the Love,' which reached #5 on the Billboard Hot 100. Their soulful, harmonious style blended R&B, jazz, and gospel influences, producing million-selling singles like 'The Closer I Get to You' (1978). They began a second duet album in 1978, but Hathaway's struggles with paranoid schizophrenia and depression led to his suicide in 1979 at age 33; Flack completed and released it as *Roberta Flack Featuring Donny Hathaway*.

Their legacy endures through timeless duets that defined 1970s soul, earning a Grammy for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals in 1973. Flack continued her career with further successes, while Hathaway's innovative songwriting and keyboard work influenced soul music, despite his tragically short life.
