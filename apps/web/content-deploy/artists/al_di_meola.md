## Biography
Al Di Meola, born in the United States, began his musical journey by attending Berklee College of Music in 1971. At age 19, he was hired by Chick Corea to join the pioneering jazz fusion band Return to Forever, replacing Bill Connors, alongside Stanley Clarke and Lenny White. He contributed to three landmark albums—Where Have I Known You Before (1974), the Grammy-winning No Mystery (1975), and Romantic Warrior (1976)—which achieved significant commercial success, all cracking the Top 40 on the U.S. Billboard pop albums chart. Following the band's disbandment in 1976, Di Meola launched his solo career with Land of the Midnight Sun, featuring collaborators like Jaco Pastorius, Steve Gadd, Jan Hammer, and Chick Corea, establishing his reputation for technical mastery, lightning-fast solos, and Latin-tinged jazz fusion.[1][2][3]

Throughout the late 1970s and 1980s, Di Meola solidified his influence with Columbia Records albums such as Elegant Gypsy (1977, gold-certified), Casino (1978), Splendido Hotel, Electric Rendezvous, Tour de Force, and Scenario, blending jazz fusion with flamenco, Mediterranean, tango, Brazilian, and Middle Eastern elements. In 1980, he formed the iconic acoustic Guitar Trio with Paco de Lucía and John McLaughlin, releasing the multi-platinum live album Friday Night in San Francisco, which sold over four million copies, followed by Passion, Grace & Fire (1982) and a 1995 reunion album Guitar Trio. He also pioneered electronic jazz with Jan Hammer on Scenario and formed World Sinfonia in 1991, exploring pan-global sounds with artists like Dino Saluzzi and Arto Tunçboyacıyan; later, The Rite of Strings with Jean-Luc Ponty and Stanley Clarke in the 1990s.[1][4][5]

Di Meola's legacy endures as a guitar virtuoso and composer with over 20 leader albums and numerous collaborations, consistently topping polls like Guitar Player's (11 wins, inducted into Gallery of Greats in 1981). Known for evolving from high-speed fusion to subtle acoustic world music, his recent works include the critically acclaimed double album TWENTYFOUR (2024), reflecting his ongoing artistic growth amid global challenges.[1][2][5]
