## Biography
Shirley Scott (March 14, 1934 – March 10, 2002), known as the 'Queen of the Organ,' was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, into a musical family; her father ran a jazz club, and her brother played saxophone in local bands. She began on piano and trumpet in high school, initially aspiring to piano mastery, but switched to the Hammond B-3 organ in the mid-1950s after filling in at a Philadelphia nightclub, influenced by local organists like Jackie Davis and Jimmy Smith. Her early career included playing piano with John Coltrane in 1955 and gaining prominence with saxophonist Eddie 'Lockjaw' Davis, recording classics like 'The Eddie Davis Cookbook' before leaving in 1960.

Scott launched her career as a leader with the 1958 Prestige album 'Great Scott!' and recorded prolifically for labels like Prestige, Impulse, and Atlantic over two decades, blending bebop, blues, gospel, and soul jazz in a lighter, more melodic style on the B-3 that set her apart from heavier players like Jimmy Smith. She married saxophonist Stanley Turrentine in 1961, collaborating extensively through the 1960s until their 1971 divorce, and worked with others like Dexter Gordon, Oliver Nelson, Harold Vick, Jimmy Forrest, and Al Grey. As organ trios waned in the 1970s, she pivoted to piano, recording fusion-influenced albums for Muse in the 1980s, and later performed in Philadelphia trios.

Scott earned B.A. and M.A. degrees from Cheyney University, where she taught jazz history and piano, received National Endowment for the Arts fellowships, directed church choirs, and served as musical director for Bill Cosby. A leading soul jazz figure in a male-dominated field, her legacy endures for innovating the Hammond organ's sound with rhythmic bebop, lyrical touch, and gospel depth.
