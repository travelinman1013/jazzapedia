## Biography
Mark Braud, born June 21, 1973, in New Orleans, Louisiana, grew up in a family of renowned musicians, including the Brunious and Santiago families. His grandfather, legendary trumpeter John 'Picket' Brunious Sr., and uncle Wendell Brunious profoundly shaped his early passion for jazz; at age 12, Wendell gave him a cornet, sparking his career. Braud began playing jazz alongside Nicholas Payton, joined the Olympia Kids (an offshoot of the Olympia Brass Band), and studied jazz performance at the University of New Orleans under Ellis Marsalis Jr. His music draws from traditional New Orleans jazz, R&B, and the great American songbook, delivering energetic, fresh interpretations of classic melodies[1][3][4][5].

Braud's professional career took off gigging with New Orleans legends like Eddie Bo, Henry Butler, Dr. Michael White’s Original Liberty Jazz Band, and the Original Tuxedo Jazz Band. Since 2001, he has been a key member of Harry Connick Jr.'s band, including on the TV show 'Harry,' and led the Preservation Hall Jazz Band from 2008 to 2016, later returning as a resident artist. A versatile collaborator, he has performed with the Marsalis family, Treme Brass Band, Blind Boys of Alabama, Foo Fighters, Tom Waits, Dr. John, and Allen Toussaint. His credits span TV (NCIS: New Orleans, Treme, American Horror Story), film (A Tuba to Cuba, The Jungle Book), and Broadway (One Mo’ Time, Harry Connick Jr. shows). In 2023, he co-founded Old Saw Music, a production music library, and in 2025, launched Colossus Brass Band[1][2][3][5].

Braud's legacy embodies the New Orleans jazz tradition, blending its down-home grooves with modern appeal. Described as one of the city's most versatile young trumpeters, his work preserves cultural heritage while reaching global audiences through tours, recordings, and media[1][4].
