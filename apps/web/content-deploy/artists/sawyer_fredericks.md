## Biography
Sawyer Christopher Fredericks, born March 31, 1999, grew up on an 88-acre family farm in central Upstate New York, where nature and open spaces profoundly shaped his musical perspective. At age 11, he began voice training and started performing regionally at farmers markets, open mics, community events, and folk clubs like The Bitter End, Caffe Lena, and Towne Crier Cafe in New York. By 13, he was honing his craft as an Americana singer-songwriter with raw, soulful vocals, deep lyrics, and a blend of folk, blues, roots rock, and jazz, which he later described as 'free range folk'. A finalist in the 2012 Young Artist Talent Search in Pawling, New York, Fredericks was scouted at 15 for The Voice.[1][2][3][4]

In 2015, at age 16, Fredericks won season 8 of NBC's The Voice as part of Team Pharrell Williams, becoming the youngest male winner in the show's history and setting iTunes sales records with 14 songs in the Overall Top 200 in one week. He signed with Republic Records, releasing his self-titled EP in November 2015 (#2 on Billboard Folk) and debut album A Good Storm in May 2016 (#2 on Billboard Folk, 11,000 first-week sales), which he supported with a 49-show US tour. Going independent in 2017 after parting amicably with his label, he self-wrote and produced Hide Your Ghost (2018), followed by Flowers for You (2020), which earned Independent Music Awards for 'Born' and 'Amen', rotation on SiriusXM's Coffee House, and inclusion in No Depression's top roots albums.[1][2][3]

Fredericks' style evolved from soulful folk-blues-rock on his major-label work to a more stripped-down, honest Americana sound independently, emphasizing live arrangements and personal storytelling. He has performed at festivals like Falcon Ridge Folk Festival, SXSW, AmericanaFest, and Folk Alliance International, solidifying his place in the folk and Americana scenes with powerful live shows and consistent releases.[2][3]
