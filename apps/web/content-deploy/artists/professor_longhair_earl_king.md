## Biography
Professor Longhair (Henry Roeland Byrd, born December 19, 1918, in Bogalusa, Louisiana) and Earl King (Earl Silas Johnson IV, born February 7, 1934, in New Orleans, Louisiana) were pivotal figures in New Orleans R&B and blues. Professor Longhair, known as 'Fess,' developed a unique piano style blending rumba rhythms, boogie-woogie, and blues after early jobs as a cook, boxer, and in civilian conservation camps. He formed his band The Midriffs (later Professor Longhair and his Four Hairs Combo) and gigged at the Caledonia Inn in 1949, gaining his nickname from the owner. His career peaked in the 1950s with hits like 'Go to the Mardi Gras' but faltered in the 1960s due to a stroke, gambling, and odd jobs like janitorial work. A late resurgence came in the 1970s with performances at Paul McCartney's party on the Queen Mary (1975), European tours, and his final album Crawfish Fiesta (1980), dying the day before its release on January 30, 1980. Earl King began as a guitarist mentored at the Dew Drop Inn, recording his first single in 1953 as Earl Johnson. Hits like 'Those Lonely, Lonely Nights' (1955, #7 R&B) for Ace Records launched him, followed by songwriting for artists like Jimmy Clanton. He joined Imperial Records, touring with Sam Cooke and writing standards like 'Come On' (1960). After a brief Motown stint in 1963, he focused on producing and writing in the late 1960s-1970s, resuming live performances in 1974 with the Radiators.

Both artists embodied New Orleans' musical fusion of blues, R&B, Mardi Gras rhythms, and brass influences. Professor Longhair's revolutionary piano triplets and percussive style influenced the city's sound, while Earl King's guitar work, poetic lyrics, and compositions like 'Big Chief' (written for Longhair) bridged blues and funk. King produced for local labels like Nola and Watch, crafting hits for Willie Tee and Lee Dorsey. Their legacies endure: Longhair as the 'godfather of New Orleans piano' with albums like Live on the Queen Mary, and King as a songwriter whose 'Come On' was covered by Jimi Hendrix and Stevie Ray Vaughan. King's intellectual pursuits outside music, including studies in Asian music and Rosicrucianism, added depth to his creative output.
