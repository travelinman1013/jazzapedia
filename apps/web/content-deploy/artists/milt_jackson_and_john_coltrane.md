## Biography
Milt Jackson, known as 'Bags,' was born on January 1, 1923, in Detroit, Michigan, and emerged as the modern jazz era's first and most influential vibraphonist. Starting professionally on vibraphone at age 16, he attended Michigan State University before joining Dizzy Gillespie's sextet in 1945 and big band, later returning to Gillespie's sextet from 1950-1952, which included John Coltrane. Jackson freelanced with top bop musicians in New York, played in Woody Herman's band, and co-founded the Modern Jazz Quartet (MJQ) in 1952, serving as its principal outlet until 1974 while recording extensively as a sideman and leader[1][5][6].

John Coltrane, born in 1926 in Hamlet, North Carolina, developed his career through key associations after early struggles with addiction, including being fired from a band in 1954. Hired by Miles Davis in 1955, he gained prominence in Davis's quintet/sestet alongside Red Garland, Paul Chambers, and Philly Joe Jones, contributing to the landmark modal album Kind of Blue in 1959. By late 1959, Coltrane recorded his Atlantic debut Giant Steps, marking his emergence as a leading performer with innovative harmonic explorations, before launching his solo career in 1960[3].

Their sole collaborative album, Bags & Trane (recorded January 1959, released 1961 on Atlantic), united the established vibraphonist Jackson—then with MJQ—with Coltrane, transitioning from Davis's group. Featuring Jackson's originals, pianist Hank Jones, bassist Paul Chambers, and drummer Connie Kay, the session highlighted Jackson's swinging bebop lines and blues against Coltrane's evolving, controversial style, though it lacked full innovation due to stylistic differences[2][4]. Jackson's legacy lies in his fluent, swinging vibraphone style blending bebop harmonies with balance and contrast, while Coltrane's influenced jazz profoundly through modal and soprano explorations until his death in 1967.

## Fun Facts
- Milt Jackson earned the nickname 'Bags' from bloodshot eyes caused by late nights, not marijuana as sometimes rumored[1].
- Bags & Trane was primarily a Milt Jackson leader date, with Coltrane added likely by Atlantic's Ahmet Ertegun to preview the saxophonist before his contract signing[2][4].
- Jackson and Coltrane first shared a stage in Dizzy Gillespie's 1951 sextet, but by 1959 their styles had diverged sharply—Jackson's swing versus Coltrane's 'practicing in public' sheets-of-sound[2].
- Jackson began in Detroit gospel churches playing piano, guitar, violin, and percussion before specializing in vibes at 16[6].
