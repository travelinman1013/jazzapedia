## Biography
Vulfpeck is an American funk band formed in 2011 in Ann Arbor, Michigan, by University of Michigan music school students Jack Stratton, Theo Katzman, Woody Goss, and Joe Dart. The group originated as a rhythm section for a performance at the Duderstadt Center, inspired by Jack Stratton's concept of an imagined German version of 1960s U.S. session musicians like the Funk Brothers, Wrecking Crew, and Muscle Shoals players. Their early releases included EPs such as Mit Peck (2011), Vollmilch (2012), and My First Car (2013), followed by full-length albums like Thrill of the Arts (2015), showcasing their tight grooves, retro-funk style, and exceptional instrumental proficiency blending funk, soul, jazz, and rock elements.[1][2][3]
