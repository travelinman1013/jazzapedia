## Biography
West, Bruce & Laing was a short-lived blues rock power trio super-group formed in February 1972, consisting of former Cream bassist and vocalist Jack Bruce (Scottish), guitarist Leslie West (American), and drummer Corky Laing (Canadian), both ex-members of Mountain. The band emerged after Mountain disbanded following a UK tour due to bassist Felix Pappalardi's departure; Bruce had prior connections with Pappalardi, who produced Cream's albums Disraeli Gears, Wheels of Fire, and Goodbye. Their musical style blended heavy blues rock, hard rock, and power trio dynamics, drawing from the legacies of Cream and Mountain with growling guitars, pounding drums, and jazzed-out blues-rock basslines.[1][2]

## Fun Facts
- "Love Is Worth the Blues" from Why Dontcha incorporates the theme from the Rolling Stones' 1965 ballad "Play With Fire," which the band later covered live on Live ‘n’ Kickin’ using Stones lyrics over their music.[1][2]
- The trio co-produced their debut with Andy Johns, engineer on Led Zeppelin, Rolling Stones' Exile on Main St., and Free albums.[1]
- Whatever Turns You On cover art by Joe Petagno depicts each member's vice: food for West, alcohol for Bruce, groupies for Laing.[1]
- The band disbanded in late 1973 due to drug problems before their live album release; members then pursued solo or reformed projects.[1]
