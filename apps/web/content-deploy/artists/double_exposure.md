## Biography
Double Exposure is a Philadelphia-based soul and disco vocal quartet that formed in the early 1960s, originally performing under the name United Image.[1][2] The group consisted of Leonard "Butch" Davis, Joe Harris, Charles Whittington, and Jimmy Williams, who shared a deep passion for music from their high school years through military service.[2] After reuniting post-military, they pursued their entertainment dreams through relentless dedication, performing four to six shows nightly across multiple venues.[2] Their early recordings as United Image appeared on Stax Records in 1971 with "Love's Creeping Up on Me" and on Branding Iron Records in 1972 with "The African Bump," though these projects received limited commercial success.[1][2]

Double Exposure achieved major commercial breakthrough after signing with Salsoul Records in 1975, releasing their debut album *Ten Percent* in 1976.[1] The title track, remixed by Walter Gibbons, became their signature hit, reaching No. 54 on the Billboard Hot 100 and No. 2 on the dance/disco charts, while also achieving gold status in multiple countries including South Africa.[1][2][5] The album's other standout tracks, "My Love Is Free" and "Everyman (Has to Carry His Own Weight)," became popular club songs and charted successfully.[1][2] They released two subsequent albums on Salsoul—*Four Play* (1978) and *Locker Room* (1979)—before fading from mainstream prominence, though they recorded one final single, "Yes, I'm In Love With You," for Gold Coast Records in 1981.[2]

Double Exposure's legacy extends far beyond their 1970s peak, as they became one of the few groups in music history to perform together with all original members intact for over five decades.[2][5] The group received numerous accolades, including a Lifetime Achievement Award from The National Rhythm and Blues Music Society, recognizing their sustained contributions to soul and disco music.[2] Following Jimmy Williams' death in October 2016 and Charles Whittington's illness, Butch Davis and Joe Harris recruited new members Lorenzo Bell and Kenny Pitt to continue the group's legacy, demonstrating their commitment to keeping Double Exposure active and performing.[5]

## Fun Facts
- Double Exposure performed an unforgettable month-long tour in South Africa in October 1978, despite initial hesitation due to apartheid concerns. They were moved to accept after learning that Black South Africans were the primary purchasers of their records and desperately wanted to see them perform.[2]
- The group recorded their breakthrough album *Ten Percent* on December 11, 1975, at Sigma Sound Studios in Philadelphia—the same legendary studio that produced hits for The O'Jays, Billy Paul, Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes, Teddy Pendergrass, The Spinners, and other icons of the Philadelphia soul empire.[2]
- Double Exposure was one of the very few groups in music history to maintain all four original members—Leonard "Butch" Davis, Joe Harris, Charles Whittington, and Jimmy Williams—throughout their entire career spanning over five decades before any lineup changes occurred.[2][5]
- The group's planned 1980 Olympic-themed album project was derailed when the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, leading President Carter to boycott the 1980 Moscow Olympics, which eliminated the promotional opportunity they had carefully planned.[2]
