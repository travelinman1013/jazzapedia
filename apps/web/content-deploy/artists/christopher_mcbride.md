## Biography
Christopher McBride is a saxophonist born in Chicago, Illinois, where he began his professional career in 2007. He relocated to New York City in 2013, establishing himself in Harlem as a versatile performer, composer, arranger, and educator known for his ability to navigate diverse musical situations with a fiery attack or mellow, soulful tone influenced by contemporary R&B and Cannonball Adderley's post-bop sensuality.[2][3] His rigorous improvising and melodically indelible compositions have earned acclaim, blending bebop, swing, straight-ahead jazz, and elements of hip-hop, gospel, and Latin music.[4]

McBride debuted as a leader with the 2012 album *Quatuor de Force*, recorded in Chicago, which showcased his leadership and songwriting. After moving to NYC, he rebranded his ensemble as The Whole Proof, experimenting with varied instrumentation to create stories through music, performing at venues across the city and running the 'Singer Meets Saxophonist' series at Minton’s Playhouse from 2017-2019.[2][3][6] His 2023 release *Ramon* reached the Top 25 on JazzWeek charts, staying for 14 weeks and ranking in the year's Top 100 albums, praised as a 'sonic marvel' of bebop and contemporary jazz.[2][4] In 2025, he released *The Hang, The Hustle, The Path*, the first of a trilogy drawing from the Black music diaspora.[4]

As an educator, McBride serves as Director of Education for the Second Line Arts Collective in New Orleans, developing curriculum for the Little Stompers division and teacher training. He received a Grammy certificate for his soloist and contributor role on Steven Feifke and Bijon Watson’s 2022 *Generation Gap Jazz Orchestra* album.[3]
