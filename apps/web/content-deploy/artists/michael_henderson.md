## Biography
Michael Earl Henderson (July 7, 1951 – July 19, 2022) was born in Mississippi and raised in Detroit, Michigan, where he began his musical journey as a prodigy. Influenced by Motown bassist James Jamerson, he taught himself electric bass at age 12 after starting on cello. By 13, he was backing local acts like The Fantastic Four and Billy Preston, and at 14, he toured with The Detroit Emeralds. In the late 1960s, he joined Stevie Wonder's band after meeting him at Chicago's Regal Theater, performing at venues like New York's Copacabana.[1][3][5]

Henderson's career skyrocketed in 1970 when Miles Davis recruited him directly from a Wonder gig, launching a pivotal seven-year collaboration on fusion albums including *Jack Johnson*, *Live-Evil*, *On the Corner*, *Agharta*, and *Pangea*. This period honed his funky, influential bass style in Davis's electric era bands. Transitioning to solo work, he partnered with drummer Norman Connors, debuting as a vocalist on hits like 'Valentine Love' (with Jean Carn), 'We Both Need Each Other' (with Phyllis Hyman), and 'You Are My Starship,' blending post-disco and quiet storm genres. He released successful R&B/soul albums on Buddah Records, such as *Solid* (1976) and *In the Night Time* (1978), featuring chart-toppers like 'Take Me I’m Yours' and 'Wide Receiver,' before retiring in 1986.[1][2][3][5]

Known for soulful ballads and funk riffs widely covered, Henderson's legacy spans jazz fusion, R&B, and soul. In the 2000s, he led Children on the Corner, revisiting Davis-era sounds with sidemen, emphasizing the untouchable uniqueness of that music. He also contributed to projects like *Miles From India*, cementing his influence as a bassist, singer, songwriter, and arranger until his death from cancer at age 71.[1][2][5]
