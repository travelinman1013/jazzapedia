## Biography
Louis Kevin Celestin, known professionally as KAYTRANADA, was born on August 25, 1992, in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, and relocated to Montreal, Canada, where he was raised in a suburb. At age 15, he dropped out of high school to pursue music full-time, initially releasing mixtapes and remixes under the alias Kaytradamus starting in 2010. He gained early recognition in Montreal's Artbeat community through remixes like an unofficial Janet Jackson track and influences from producers such as KenLo, High Klassified, and Da-P, blending J Dilla-inspired hip-hop beats with woozy house, disco, '90s R&B, Afro-beat, funk, soul, and electronic styles.[1][2][3][5]
