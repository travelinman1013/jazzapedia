## Biography
Arthur Frank 'Monk' Hazel (1903-1968) was born on August 15, 1903, in Harvey, Louisiana, on the West Bank near New Orleans. His father was a drummer, sparking his early interest in music, and he began his career as a drummer with cornetist Emmett Hardy in 1919, who gave him his first cornet. Throughout the 1920s, Hazel performed with notable bands including those led by Happy Schilling, Jules Bauduc, Tony Parenti, Abbie Brunies' Halfway House Orchestra, Stalebread Lacombe, and Johnny Wiggs, while also playing cornet with Johnny Fischer's Brass Band. His first recording came in 1927 with Johnny Hyman's Bayou Stompers.[1][2][3][4]

In the late 1920s, Hazel led his own **Bienville Roof Orchestra**, which performed atop the Bienville Hotel at Lee Circle in New Orleans and recorded four tracks for Brunswick Records in December 1928, including 'High Society,' 'Sizzling the Blues,' 'Git-Wit-It,' and 'Ideas' (directed by Sharkey Bonano). He then spent time in New York (1929-1931) with Johnny Wiggs, Jack Pettis, and his own group, followed by a stint in Hollywood touring with singer Gene Austin. After serving in the Army from 1942-1943 and a brief period outside music, Hazel returned to New Orleans post-World War II, associating with Sharkey's Kings of Dixieland and working with Santo Pecora, George Girard, Joe Caprano (1937), Mike Lala, and others. In 1954, he recorded a full album for Southland Records featuring sidemen like Pete Fountain and Al Hirt.[1][2][3]

A versatile musician skilled on drums, cornet, and mellophone (sometimes listed as melotron), Hazel's style rooted in New Orleans jazz and ragtime made him a fixture on the local scene for decades until his death on March 5, 1968, in New Orleans. His legacy endures through his recordings and contributions to traditional jazz preservation.[1][2][4]
