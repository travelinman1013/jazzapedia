## Biography
Bob Havens, born Robert Havens on May 3, 1930, in Quincy, Illinois, grew up in a musical family and began studying violin, piano, and trombone at age seven. He secured his first professional gig with a local dance band at age 12 and earned a scholarship to the Interlochen Music Camp in Michigan at 16, where he held the first trombone chair in the school's 250-piece band. He later played first trombone in the Quincy Symphony while performing with popular dance groups in Illinois. After serving in the Illinois National Guard during the Korean War, Havens launched his professional career in 1955 touring with the Ralph Flanagan Orchestra.[1][2]

In 1956, Havens joined George Girard's Dixieland Band at the Famous Door in New Orleans, where he met his idol Jack Teagarden, solidifying his style as a leading proponent of the Teagarden approach to Dixieland trombone—characterized by powerful delivery, smooth phrasing, and technical skill with a warm sound. The next year, he collaborated with Al Hirt at Dan's Pier 600 on Bourbon Street, forming Hirt's first band alongside Pete Fountain. He recorded with these groups on labels like Good Times Jazz, Vic, Verve, Audio Fidelity, and Southland until 1960, when he joined the Lawrence Welk Orchestra as a featured soloist on their weekly TV show, serving for 23 years until 1982.[1][2][3]

Post-Welk, Havens freelanced with the Bob Crosby Bobcats and Benny Goodman Orchestra (led by Peanuts Hucko), and from 1985 to 1995 played with the Great Pacific Jazz Band featuring Bob Ringwald, Don Nelson, and Zeke Zarchy. He continued recording, including the 2005 CD 'Mr Back Home in New Orleans,' and performed at jazz festivals worldwide, notably a 2005 Hurricane Katrina benefit with the North Carolina Pops Orchestra and Ava Barber. Residing in Quincy, Illinois, Havens remains active in jazz into his later years, acclaimed as one of the world's greatest Dixieland trombonists.[1][2]
