## Biography
Marisa Monte, born on July 1, 1967, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to an engineer father, developed an early passion for music influenced by Brazilian traditions like bossa nova and MPB. She moved to New York in her late teens to study music, where she caught the attention of journalist/producer Nelson Motta, who encouraged her return to Brazil. There, she organized shows that built a strong fan base before her debut album in 1989, marking immediate commercial and critical success.[4][5][6]

Monte's career evolved through innovative blends of Brazilian elements with global sounds, establishing her as a songwriter and experimental artist. Her 1994 album *Rose and Tomato* featured collaborations with Carlinhos Brown, leading to the Tribalistas project with Brown and Arnaldo Antunes. She partnered with producers like Arto Lindsay on *Mais*, attracting vanguard artists such as Ryuichi Sakamoto, Marc Ribot, and international figures including David Byrne on the 1996 AIDS benefit album *Red Hot + Rio*, where they covered a Jobim-Regina duet, and Philip Glass on arrangements for *Universo Ao Meu Redor*. Monte owns her song rights and records on her own label distributed by Sony, releasing works like *Portas* in 2022 via remote collaborations.[2][3][4][5]

Her legacy includes being the first Brazilian woman to receive the Tenco Award for lifetime achievement in songwriting, representing a culmination of MPB traditions while pushing boundaries with risks, intelligence, and a curiosity for the human condition. Over three decades, her work rivals golden-era stars like Caetano Veloso and Gilberto Gil.[2][5]
