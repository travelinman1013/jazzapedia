## Biography
The Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra (JLCO), often referred to as the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra, is a premier big band ensemble founded in 1986 as part of Jazz at Lincoln Center, an organization dedicated to preserving and advancing jazz. Based in New York City at Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, the orchestra was established to perform swing, blues, and traditional jazz styles with proper acoustics, housing educational programs and archives. Under the artistic direction of Grammy-winning trumpeter Wynton Marsalis since its inception, the JLCO has become a leading interpreter of jazz history, commissioning new works and collaborating across genres.[3][5][10]

The orchestra's career development centers on celebrating jazz's evolution, from early influences like Caribbean and Latin American rhythms in New Orleans and San Juan Hill to bebop, hard bop, and cool jazz innovations by figures such as Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker, Horace Silver, and Miles Davis. The JLCO performs a wide repertoire, including newly commissioned pieces inspired by art, literature like Dante's Divine Comedy, and global traditions from Africa, blending historical dialogue with contemporary expression. Music director Sherman Irby and other members emphasize bebop's radical influence on modern genres.[2][6][8]

Known for its **big band** style rooted in latin jazz, swing, and blues-oriented jazz, the JLCO maintains a legacy of innovation while honoring jazz's creolized origins, including 'Spanish tinge' elements noted by Jelly Roll Morton. Through worldwide tours, Symphony Center performances, and recordings on the Blue Engine label, it continues to shape jazz education and performance, influencing new generations.[1][7][9]
