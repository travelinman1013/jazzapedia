## Biography
Edwin Starr, born Charles Edwin Hatcher on January 21, 1942, in Nashville, Tennessee, moved with his cousins Roger and Willie Hatcher to Cleveland, Ohio, where he was raised and began his musical journey in 1957 by forming the doo-wop group The Future Tones. After completing military service in the USA and Germany, he relocated to Detroit in the early 1960s, adopting his stage name suggested by Don Briggs, manager of the Bill Doggett Combo. He signed with the Ric-Tic label under Ed Wingate, releasing breakthrough singles like 'Agent Double-O-Soul' (1965), a James Bond-inspired hit that reached the US top 20, along with 'S.O.S. (Stop Her On Sight)' and 'Headline News,' establishing his bold, James Brown-esque soul style.[1][2][3][5][7]

In 1968, Motown acquired Ric-Tic, bringing Starr into its roster; he released his debut Motown album *Soul Master* that year, followed by *25 Miles* (1969), with the title track hitting #6 on US pop and R&B charts. His career peaked with the Norman Whitfield-produced anti-Vietnam War anthem 'War' (1970), originally offered to The Temptations, which topped the US charts and became a global protest classic, recorded in one take due to limited studio time. Starr's rough, shouting soul vocals influenced Motown's shift toward socially conscious music in the 1970s, with further hits like 'Stop the War Now' (1971).[1][2][3][4][5][6]

Relocating to England in the 1970s, Starr became a Northern Soul icon, releasing music on labels like Motorcity Records (1989-1991) with the album *Where Is the Sound*, contributing to Ferry Aid's 'Let It Be' charity single, and scoring a UK hit with 'It's Not Fair' (1985). He continued performing until his death on April 2, 2003, leaving a legacy in Motown, Northern Soul, and protest soul.[2][3][4][5]
