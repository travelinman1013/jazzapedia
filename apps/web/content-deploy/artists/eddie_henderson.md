## Biography
Eddie Henderson, born in 1940 in New York City, grew up in a musically rich environment during the Harlem Renaissance; his mother danced at the Cotton Club, and his father sang with Billy Williams and the Charioteers. At age nine, he received his first trumpet lesson from Louis Armstrong through his mother's connections. After his father's death, his family moved to San Francisco at age 14, where he studied classical trumpet at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music (1954-1957), discovered figure skating—becoming the first African American to compete nationally—and was inspired by Miles Davis, who visited his home and encouraged his originality. Henderson pursued dual careers, earning a BS in zoology from UC Berkeley (1964) and an MD from Howard University (1968), while serving in the U.S. Air Force (1958-1961).[2][3][4][7]

From 1970-1973, Henderson gained worldwide recognition playing trumpet in Herbie Hancock's innovative Mwandishi sextet, contributing to albums like Mwandishi, Crossings, Sextant, Realization, and Inside Out, blending jazz fusion with cosmic and experimental elements. Balancing psychiatry practice in San Francisco with nightly gigs at Keystone Korner, he collaborated with Pharoah Sanders, Norman Connors, Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers, and others, releasing Blue Note fusion albums Sunburst (1975) and Heritage (1976), with 'Prance On' from Comin' Through (1977) charting on Billboard. He joined Latin-jazz group Azteca in 1975 and led his own bands through the 1980s.[1][2][3][6]

In 1985, Henderson left medicine full-time to care for his ailing mother in New York, shifting to acoustic hard bop and working with Elvin Jones, McCoy Tyner, Dexter Gordon, Max Roach, and more. Known for his expressive brass in jazz funk, fusion, soul jazz, and straight-ahead styles, he continues performing, embodying a legacy of prolific versatility across medicine, sports, and music.[1][2][3]
