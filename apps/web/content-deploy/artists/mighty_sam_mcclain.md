## Fun Facts
- His 1966 hit 'Sweet Dreams' was a cover of Patsy Cline's song, but Sam infused it with spiritual meaning, interpreting the 'you' as his Maker rather than a romantic interest.[1]
- After early success, he became homeless, eating from trash bins and sleeping on park benches, yet never gave up on his music.[1][3]
- A chance encounter with a Japanese tourist in New Orleans led to his first international tour and a live album in 1987, revitalizing his career.[1]
- In 2008, he co-wrote 'Show Me The Way' with saxophonist Scott Shetler for the Give US Your Poor project and performed it as a duet with Jon Bon Jovi to fight homelessness.[2]
