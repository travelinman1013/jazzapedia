## Biography
Lillian Hardin Armstrong, born on February 2, 1898, in Memphis, Tennessee, displayed early musical talent by playing a neglected harmonium and imaginary pianos as a child. After studying at Mrs. Hook’s school and briefly at Fisk University, where she faced criticism for her training, she moved to Chicago and honed her skills in classical music while developing a jazz flair at a music store. She began her professional career with Lawrence Duhé’s New Orleans Creole Jazz Band in 1918, earning the nickname 'Hot Miss Lil,' and progressed to gigs at De Luxe Café and Dreamland with Alberta Hunter, before joining King Oliver’s Creole Jazz Band in 1921, a pivotal moment that introduced her to cornetist Louis Armstrong.[1][2][4]
