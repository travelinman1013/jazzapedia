## Biography
Leroy Brown is a distinguished reggae artist born and raised in Kingston, Jamaica, who emerged as a pioneering figure in roots reggae music during the 1960s. His musical journey began in his childhood through his mother's involvement with the local church choir, where he first developed his passion for singing. Discovered by Alton Ellis, the "Godfather of Rocksteady," at age eleven, Brown quickly became immersed in Jamaica's vibrant music scene, performing with Ellis and later joining influential groups including The Hippy Boys alongside the Barrett brothers (Aston "Family Man" and Carlton) and The Emotions with Lloyd Shakespeare and Audley Rollen. These formative years established him as a respected vocalist within Jamaica's rocksteady and early reggae movements.

In 1971, Brown relocated to Canada to pursue new opportunities, where he founded The Roys with Leroy Gibbons and Roy Reynolds, solidifying his reputation as a pioneer reggae artist in the Canadian music landscape. His recording career flourished during the mid-1970s, with notable sessions at Jamaica's premier studios including Duke Reid's Treasure Isle, Channel One, and King Tubby's. His album "Prayer of Peace" (1976), recorded with His Defence Force, showcased his deep roots reggae style and lyrical depth. Brown continued recording through the 1980s, including the rare 12" release "Blood A Go Run" with The Black Traps (1986), mixed by Sugar Minott. He received multiple accolades including Juno Awards and the Bob Marley Memorial Award, and has been recognized as one of the key figures in establishing reggae music's foundation in Canada. In 2007, he returned to Jamaica to continue his recording work, maintaining an active presence in the reggae community.
