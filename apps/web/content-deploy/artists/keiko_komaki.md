## Biography
Keiko Komaki, an accomplished keyboardist, pianist, composer, and arranger, was born and raised in Kagoshima, Japan, where she began studying classical piano with her aunt at the age of five. She demonstrated early passion and dedication, graduating from Kunitachi College of Music with a degree in music. While classically trained, Komaki developed a fascination for improvisation, funk, blues, and jazz fusion, performing at venues in Tokyo with groups like Chillhaze, which specialized in New Orleans-style funk.[1][2][3]

In 2006, Komaki made the bold decision to move to New Orleans despite family opposition, immersing herself in the city's vibrant music scene. She quickly joined the band of Blues Queen Marva Wright, learning blues under bandleader Benny Turner, brother of Freddie King. Following Wright's passing, Komaki became a fixture in New Orleans, performing on Frenchman Street with acts like Brass-a-holics and Gary Brown, and collaborating with Vasti Jackson, Charlie Wooton, George Porter Jr., and others at iconic venues like the Maple Leaf Bar. Her punchy, shuffle style blended classical grace with funky, dynamic energy across blues, funk, rock, and jazz.[1][2][3][4]

In 2013, producer Mark Johnson recruited her for the Playing for Change (PFC) project, where she played keyboards on tracks like 'Better Place' and 'Down by the Riverside,' leading to a worldwide tour with the PFC Band across 20 countries and prestigious stages such as the United Nations, John F. Kennedy Center, and New Orleans Jazz Festival, sharing bills with artists like the Doobie Brothers and Keb' Mo'. Since 2021, she has focused on her own projects, including the Keiko Komaki Band, the KJD Trio with June Yamagishi and Donald MaGee, and the Marc Stone Band, solidifying her legacy as a bridge between Japanese roots and New Orleans music.[1][2][3][4]
