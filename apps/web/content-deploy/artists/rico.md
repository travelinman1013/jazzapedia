## Biography
Rico Rene Granados Blanco (born March 17, 1973) is a Filipino singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, record producer, actor, endorser and entrepreneur who has become one of the Philippines' most well-received local music icons. He began his career as one of the founding members of the Filipino rock band Rivermaya in 1994, serving as the chief songwriter, vocalist, guitarist, and keyboardist until 2007. During his tenure with Rivermaya, Blanco produced albums for several notable bands including Slapshock's Project 11–41, Sugarfree's Sa Wakas, and The Dawn's Salamat (Millennium edition single), earning an NU Rock award for Producer of the Year for Rivermaya's Free album.

Blanco transitioned to a solo career in 2008 when Warner Music Philippines launched his first single "Yugto" on June 12, 2008, which was immediately hailed by critics and music fans as a "neo-epic" and won four major Awit awards including Song of the Year. His debut solo album Your Universe, released on August 8, 2008, showcased a diverse sonic palette ranging from ethno-rock to rockabilly and Pinoy-folk influences. His solo work earned him the NU Rock Awards "Vocalist of the Year" in November 2008 and RX93.1 "OPM Solo Artist of the Year" in December 2008, establishing him as a major force in contemporary Filipino music.

Beyond his recording career, Blanco has been active in music production and television, hosting MYX Live and serving as host and judge on shows including Born To Be A Star (2016) and Kanta Pilipinas (2013). He has continued to produce music for other artists, including the posthumous solo debut album of Slapshock frontman Jamir Garcia in 2021, and has remained a consistent performer on ASAP Natin To (2016, 2021).
