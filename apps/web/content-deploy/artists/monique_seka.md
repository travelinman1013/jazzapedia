## Biography
Monique Séka was born on November 22, 1965, in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, into a rich musical heritage as the daughter of renowned singer Okoi Séka and niece of Gun Morgan.[1][3] She grew up influenced by her family's musical legacy and the legendary group Les Sœurs Comoé, which shaped her early artistic sensibilities.[1] After a lengthy stint with the Ivory Coast Television Orchestra, where she performed various musical styles, Séka launched her solo career in 1985 with her debut album "Tantie Affouée," followed by her breakthrough second album "Missounwa" in 1989, which received the Gran Prix de la Musique Afro-Caribéenne and featured the hit title track with a salsa feel.[2][3][6]

Séka revolutionized the African music scene by creating Afro-zouk, a distinctive fusion blending traditional Ivorian music—including Akan and Mandingo styles and the Mapouka dance—with Caribbean, Haitian, and other global influences such as Afrobeat, rumba, soukous, and zouk.[2][4] Her third album "Okaman" (1995), produced by Cape Verdean keyboardist Manu Lima, catapulted her to international prominence, with the title track selling over one million copies.[2][4] Nicknamed the "Queen of Afro-zouk music," she is recognized for her exceptional vocal tone and has sustained a career spanning over three decades, releasing five studio albums and numerous compilation albums including "Adéba" (1997), "Yélélé" (1999), and "Anthologie" (2000).[2][3]

Séka's music emphasizes authenticity and addresses social themes, particularly women's experiences, unity, and emancipation while maintaining cultural identity.[2] She married producer and manager Dominique Richard on March 31, 1995, and they have three children together.[2][4] Currently residing in Lyon, France, Séka's Afro-zouk genre has gained popularity across Africa, the Caribbean, and the Indian Ocean region, establishing her as a significant figure in African music history.[2][3][4]

## Fun Facts
- Séka's inspiration for creating Afro-zouk came from noticing that traditional Ivorian music was not played in discos at the time, prompting her to merge her country's traditional music with Caribbean island influences.[2]
- Her album "Okaman" (1995) achieved remarkable commercial success, with the title track selling over one million copies according to music critic Craig Harris, earning her significant international recognition.[2][4]
- Séka made her first performance in East Africa on July 26, 1997, at the Nile Hotel gardens (now Kampala Serena Hotel) in Uganda, where she shared the stage with late Congolese singer and composer Aurlus Mabele.[2]
- Despite her international success, Séka emphasizes that singing and authenticity are most important to her, deliberately stepping away from marketing-focused approaches to maintain the integrity of her music.[1]
