## Biography
James Brandon Lewis, born on August 13, 1983, in Buffalo, New York, was raised in the church and attended the Buffalo Academy for the Visual and Performing Arts. He continued his studies at Howard University, graduating in 2006, where he worked with influential jazz figures including Geri Allen, Benny Golson, Bill Pierce, and Wallace Roney, initially focusing on gospel music. Lewis earned his MFA in 2010 from the California Institute of the Arts, studying the work of music theorist Joseph Schillinger, before relocating to New York City in 2012 and transitioning to jazz, releasing his debut album Divine Travels in 2014.[2][1][4][6]

Lewis has developed a distinctive musical style blending gospel-informed spirituality, free-jazz abandon, hard-hitting funk, hip-hop rhythms, and post-harmolodic elements, earning praise from The New York Times as a saxophonist who 'embodies and transcends tradition' and from Sonny Rollins as a promising talent. He has released critically acclaimed albums like Molecular (2020), Jesup Wagon (2021), and Apple Cores with his trio, while leading ensembles such as the James Brandon Lewis Quartet and Red Lily Quintet. Voted Rising Star Tenor Saxophonist by Downbeat in 2020 and top Tenor Saxophonist by Jazz Times in 2021, he received the inaugural PhD Fellowship in Creativity from the University of the Arts with Questlove and tours internationally.[1][3][5][7]

As a co-founder of the American Book Award-winning Ensemble Heroes Are Gang Leaders, Lewis continues to innovate through concepts like Molecular Systematic Music, which maps a musician's 'musical DNA' for composition and improvisation. His collaborations, including the 2024 album The Messthetics and James Brandon Lewis with the experimental jazz-punk trio The Messthetics, underscore his legacy as a boundary-pushing force in contemporary jazz.[3][7]
