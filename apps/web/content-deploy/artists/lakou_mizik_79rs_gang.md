## Biography
Lakou Mizik is a multigenerational collective of Haitian musicians formed in the aftermath of the devastating 2010 earthquake in Haiti. The group came together in November 2010 in Port-au-Prince, initiated by guitarist and singer Steeve Valcourt (son of an iconic Haitian musician), singer Jonas Attis, and American producer Zach Niles, amid challenges like a cholera epidemic and political unrest. Their mission was to showcase Haiti's cultural resilience through roots music, blending elder legends with young talents to spread messages of pride, strength, and hope. Key members include Sanba Zao, a veteran of the racine (roots) music movement and master drummer; Jonas Attis, a prolific songwriter mixing roots, pop, and hip-hop; Nadine, a powerful roots singer who overcame initial hesitations due to her Christian background; bassist Lamarre Junior, who bridges church and vodou music; and rara horn players Ti Piti and James from the Silibo Tet Syel band, whose intricate melodies define the group's sound.[1][2][4]

The band's career developed through electrifying live shows that evoke church revivals, political rallies, and vodou rituals, leading to their critically acclaimed debut album *Wa Di Yo*, recorded at the Artists Institute in Jacmel. Their music fuses Haitian traditions like rara, vodou rhythms, and racine with African, French, Caribbean, and U.S. influences, featuring call-and-response vocals, accordion, intricate bass, interlocking guitars, and polyrhythmic horns. Lakou Mizik has become one of Haiti's hottest international exports, performing globally and releasing collaborative works like the 2019 album *HaitiaNola*, which connects Haitian Kanaval traditions with New Orleans Mardi Gras sounds alongside American artists.[1][2][5][6]

Lakou Mizik's legacy lies in reviving and modernizing Haitian roots music, honoring cultural heritage while addressing social issues through danceable, soulful grooves. Spanning ages from early twenties to late sixties, the nine-member ensemble represents diverse backgrounds across Haiti, fostering unity and inspiring global audiences with their positive, healing messages.[2][4][7]
