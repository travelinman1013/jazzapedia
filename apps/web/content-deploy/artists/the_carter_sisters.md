## Biography
The Carter Sisters, also known as Mother Maybelle and the Carter Sisters, were formed in the 1940s by Maybelle Carter and her three daughters—Helen, Anita, and June—following the original Carter Family's disbandment. Emerging from the legendary Carter Family trio of A.P. Carter, Sara Carter, and Maybelle Carter, who pioneered country music with their 1927 Bristol Sessions recordings, the group continued the family's traditional mountain sound featuring close harmonies, autoharp, guitar, and Maybelle's innovative 'Carter scratch' picking style. They performed on border radio stations in Texas during the late 1930s and early 1940s, reaching vast audiences, and later toured extensively, blending classic country ballads like 'Wildwood Flower' and 'Keep on the Sunny Side' with their distinctive acoustic arrangements.[1][3][7]

## Fun Facts
- The group performed on powerful 'border blaster' radio stations like XERA in Mexico, which reached much of North America and introduced their music to future stars including Johnny Cash and Waylon Jennings.[3]
- Maybelle's daughter Anita impressed producers as a child by singing about a 'purdy liddle kitty cat,' leading to her sisters Helen and June joining the act.[6]
- They continued performing under both 'Mother Maybelle and the Carter Sisters' and the original 'Carter Family' name after 1960.[3]
- Anita Carter was the first of Maybelle's daughters to join border radio broadcasts, making her siblings jealous as they listened from Virginia.[3]
