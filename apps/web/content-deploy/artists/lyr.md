## Biography
No credible sources identify a musical artist named 'LYR' in the sea shanties or Celtic genres. Search results highlight historical figures like Stan Hugill (1906-1992), born in Hoylake, England, who went to sea in 1921 and became a key figure in the international shanty tradition, often called the last genuine shantyman on British ships. He settled in Aberdovey, Wales, after World War II, documenting shanties with strong Irish influences in works like his seminal book on sea songs[1][6].

Hugill's career bridged traditional sailing life and the folk revival, emphasizing hybrid origins of shanties from African-American, West Indian, Latin American, and especially Irish sources, including tunes, words, and Gaelic phrases adapted by Liverpool-Irish crews. His musical style focused on authentic, raucous performances critiquing land-based singers for lacking atmosphere, influencing the revival genre[1][3].

While not 'LYR', Hugill's legacy endures as a preserver of shanty music, shaping folk interpretations through performances and writings that popularized the form beyond maritime contexts[3][6].

## Fun Facts
- Stan Hugill claimed many shanties like 'Leave Her, Johnny' originated as Irish emigrant songs such as 'Across the Rocky Mountains'[1].
- He emphasized Irish tunes and macaronic Gaelic terms in deep-water repertoire, sung in an 'imitative Irish brogue' on Liverpool-Atlantic routes[1].
- Hugill critiqued shore singers for not being 'raucous or strident enough' to capture true shanty atmosphere[1].
- Patrick Tayluer (1856-1948), another shantyman, walked 2500 miles from Brisbane to Perth in 1929-1930, documented in Australian newspapers[2].
