## Biography
The B-52's are an American new wave band formed in 1976 in Athens, Georgia, by Fred Schneider (vocals), Kate Pierson (vocals, organ), Cindy Wilson (vocals, bongos), Ricky Wilson (guitar, Cindy's brother), and Keith Strickland (drums). The group originated from a spontaneous jam session after drinks at a Chinese restaurant, adopting their name from the bouffant hairstyles worn by Pierson and Wilson. With little prior musical experience, they embraced a quirky, thrift-store aesthetic blending garage rock, post-punk, and campy elements, debuting at a Valentine's Day house party in 1977 and quickly gaining traction in New York's CBGB and Max's Kansas City scenes.[1][2][3][4]

Their self-titled debut album in 1979, produced by Chris Blackwell, featured the hit 'Rock Lobster' and sold over 500,000 copies, followed by Wild Planet (1980) with tracks like 'Private Idaho.' Tragedy struck in 1985 when guitarist Ricky Wilson died of AIDS during sessions for Bouncing Off the Satellites (1986), leading to a hiatus as Strickland switched to guitar. The band rebounded with the massively successful Cosmic Thing (1989), co-produced by Don Was and Nile Rodgers, propelled by 'Love Shack' and 'Roam,' selling over five million copies and cementing their alternative rock legacy.[1][2][3]

Known for genre-defying songs, exaggerated wigs, go-go boots, and a party vibe that influenced the alternative music scene, the B-52's continued with releases like the 2015 live album from an early Talking Heads opener show. Cindy Wilson briefly left in 1991 but returned, and the group celebrated milestones like their 34th anniversary in Athens in 2011, maintaining their vibrant, cosmic dancehall energy.[2][3]
