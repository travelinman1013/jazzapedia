## Biography
Chano Domínguez, Hamilton de Holanda, and Rubem Dantas form a collaborative trio known for their fusion of flamenco, Latin jazz, choro, and contemporary jazz, highlighted in their 2021-2022 album 'Chabem'. Chano Domínguez, a pianist from Cádiz, Spain, has over 40 years of experience blending jazz and flamenco, releasing more than 20 albums as a bandleader and earning a 2012 Grammy nomination for 'Flamenco Sketches'. Hamilton de Holanda, born March 30, 1976, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, is a virtuoso bandolinist who began playing at age 5, formed the group Dois de Ouro with his brother Fernando César, and has garnered multiple Latin Grammy nominations. Rubem Dantas, a Brazilian percussionist from Bahia, pioneered the integration of percussion like the cajón into flamenco after moving to Spain in 1976, studying under Vadinho do Gantois.

Their careers developed through extensive collaborations: Domínguez with jazz icons like Wynton Marsalis and Paco de Lucía, de Holanda with Yamandu Costa and Mike Marshall, and Dantas with flamenco fusion acts including Camarón and Ketama. Together, they performed at events like the 2023 Barga Jazz Festival, showcasing Domínguez's piano, de Holanda's bandolim, and Dantas's percussion in a style that merges Spanish flamenco rhythms with Brazilian choro and jazz improvisation. Domínguez received Spain's 2020 National Prize for Current Music for his personal style and legacy in jazz-flamenco.[1][2][3]

This trio's music exemplifies cross-cultural innovation, with 'Chabem' capturing their shared virtuosity and stylistic synthesis, influencing the global fusion jazz scene while building on each artist's individual legacies of boundary-pushing performances and recordings.[2][3][4]
