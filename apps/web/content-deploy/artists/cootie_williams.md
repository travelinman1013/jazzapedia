## Biography
Charles Melvin 'Cootie' Williams, born on July 24, 1910, in Mobile, Alabama, was a pioneering jazz trumpeter renowned for his 'jungle' style and masterful use of the plunger mute. Self-taught, he began performing professionally at age 14 with the Young Family Band alongside saxophonist Lester Young, then moved to Pensacola, Florida, at 15 to join Calvin Shields' group. By 1928, he relocated to New York City, recording with James P. Johnson and playing with Chick Webb and Fletcher Henderson, before joining Duke Ellington's orchestra in 1929 as Bubber Miley's replacement, staying for 11 years and defining the band's sound through pieces like 'Echoes of Harlem' and 'Concerto for Cootie.'[1][2][4]

Williams left Ellington in 1940 for a brief stint with Benny Goodman's orchestra, then formed his own successful big band in 1941, featuring talents like Charlie Parker and Eddie 'Lockjaw' Davis, which debuted in Chicago in 1942. As the big band era waned, he shifted to rhythm and blues ensembles in the late 1940s, recording albums like 'Cootie Williams in Hi-Fi' (1958) and 'The Big Challenge' (1957) with Rex Stewart. Influenced by Louis Armstrong, Williams expanded mute techniques and open-horn playing, blending intimate, extroverted, and harsh tones with sophisticated harmony.[1][2][4]

He rejoined Ellington in 1962, remaining until 1974 and continuing with Mercer Ellington's band into the 1970s. Williams performed at Super Bowl IX halftime in 1975 and died on September 15, 1985, in Queens, New York. Posthumously inducted into the Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame in 1991, his legacy endures as a distinctive stylist bridging swing, big band, bebop, and R&B.[1][2][4]
