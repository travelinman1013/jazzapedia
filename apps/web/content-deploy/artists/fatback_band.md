## Biography
The Fatback Band was formed in New York City in 1970 by Bill 'Fatback' Curtis, an experienced session drummer born in Fayetteville, North Carolina, who had been playing professionally since the 1950s after serving in the U.S. Army and studying at Mannes College of Music and New York University School of Music. Curtis drew inspiration from his time touring with artists like Bill Doggett, King Curtis, Paul Williams, and Clyde McPhatter, developing a signature 'fatback' groove that fused the New Orleans jazz beat with West Indian and Caribbean rhythms, laying the groundwork for early disco and funk sounds. The initial lineup featured Curtis on drums, guitarist Johnny King, bassist Johnny Flippin, trumpet player George Williams, saxophonist Earl Shelton, conga player Wayne Woolford, flautist George Adams, and keyboardist Gerry Thomas, establishing a tight 'street funk' style.[1][2][3]

## Fun Facts
- Their 1979 single 'King Tim III (Personality Jock)' is widely considered the first commercially released hip hop record, predating better-known early rap tracks.
- Bill Curtis earned his 'Fatback' nickname from guitarist Eric Gale, who admired Curtis's greasy, funky drumbeat style during session work.
- Songs like '(Are You Ready) Do the Bus Stop' and 'Double Dutch' helped popularize line dancing movements.
- The band released over 35 albums spanning jazz, funk, R&B, disco, rap, and soul, with Curtis reactivating their label in 2004 for new material.
