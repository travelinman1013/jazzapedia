## Biography
Melhem Barakat (15 August 1945 – 28 October 2016) was a renowned Lebanese singer, songwriter, and melodist born in Kfarshima, Lebanon. Growing up immersed in the sounds of Egyptian composer Mohammed Abdel Wahab, he displayed early musical talent as a child, captivating audiences at school parties by composing and performing pieces from school journals. His career began in the 1960s, where he quickly rose to prominence by establishing a unique genre through his distinctive singing and composing style, becoming one of Lebanon's most esteemed stars. Barakat staunchly performed in colloquial Lebanese dialect, critiquing peers for adopting Egyptian for commercial gain, and participated as both actor and singer in Rahbani Brothers' musicals and operettas, solidifying his status as one of the country's strongest voices.[1]

Throughout the 1980s, Barakat expanded into acting, appearing in Lebanese films with hits like 'Kboush El Touti' and 'Wahdi Ana (I am alone).' In the 1990s, he starred in the theater play 'Wemsheet Bee Tariki' alongside dancer Dani Boustros. Post-2000, he released popular songs such as 'Habibi Enta,' later covered by his ex-wife May Hariri, and collaborated with prominent artists including Najwa Karam, Karol Sakr, Shatha Hassoun, and Majida El Roumi. Touring internationally in Australia, South America, Canada, and the US, he achieved stardom across Arab countries, particularly Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon, despite modest appeal in Egypt. His best-known works include 'Amarine,' 'Abouha Radi,' 'Farah Ennass,' and 'Habibi Inta,' leaving a lasting legacy in Lebanese music.[1][2]

Barakat's insistence on Lebanese dialect and innovative style influenced the regional music scene, blending traditional elements with his personal flair. His multifaceted career in music, theater, and film, spanning over five decades, cemented his position as a cultural icon until his passing in 2016.[1]
