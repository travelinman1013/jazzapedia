## Biography
Kenneth Daniel Ball (1930–2013), born in Ilford, Essex, England, began his musical career as a sideman in various British jazz bands while working at an advertising company. In 1953, he transitioned to full-time music, playing with groups led by Sid Philpott, Lambert, Eric Delaney, and Terry Lightfoot before forming his own traditional jazz band, Kenny Ball and His Jazzmen, in 1958 with trombonist John Bennett. The group capitalized on the trad jazz revival, achieving major hits like 'Samantha' (UK #13 in 1961) and the million-selling 'Midnight in Moscow' (UK and US #2), alongside other chart successes such as 'Hello, Dolly!' (1964) and a cover of The Beatles' 'When I'm Sixty-Four' (1967).[1][2][4]
