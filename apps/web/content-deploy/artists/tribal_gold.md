## Biography
No comprehensive biographical information on a musical artist or group named 'Tribal Gold' matching the reggae, reggae rock, and roots reggae genres from Spotify was found in credible sources. Search results reference 'Don Carlos & Gold' as a reggae collaboration from the 1980s, featuring Jamaican singer Don Carlos (born Euvin McCallus Spencer, June 29, 1952) with an artist named Gold on albums like *Them Never Know Natty Dread Have Him Credential* (1981) and *Raving Tonight* (1983), but no details on Gold's identity or biography[1]. Separately, 'Tribal Gold' appears as a New Orleans-based fusion project uniting The New Orleans Suspects (funk/R&B) and Big Chief Juan Pardo & the Golden Comanche (Mardi Gras Indian tribe), focused on cultural preservation through groove-heavy music and chants, with a noted performance at Tampa's Gasparilla Music Festival[4].

Brian & Tony Gold, a Jamaican reggae/dancehall duo from Portmore, St. Catherine, do not align with 'Tribal Gold' but share genre similarities; they gained success in the 1990s with hits like 'Can You' (1992) addressing apartheid[2]. No verified early life, career development, musical style details, or legacy exist for a 'Tribal Gold' entity in reggae contexts. General roots reggae history ties to Rastafari influences like Marcus Garvey and Haile Selassie, but not specifically to this name[3].
