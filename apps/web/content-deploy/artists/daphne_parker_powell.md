## Biography
Daphne Parker Powell was raised amid the Appalachian foothills in an old-time family band, immersing her in traditional music from an early age. She has led a multifaceted life, living in Brooklyn, sailing around the world on tall ships where she taught, owning a record store and label, hosting festivals and concerts, and now based bicoastally between New London, CT, and New Orleans, LA. Powell has faced significant personal challenges, including divorce and cancer, which have deeply influenced her songwriting, as seen in albums like *The Starter Wife* (2022), her sixth LP, and her seventh, *The Death Of Cool* (upcoming in 2026).[1][2][3][7]

Her career as a singer-songwriter spans folk, country, jazz, theatrical pop, futuristic folk-rock, alternative-roots, and New Orleans-infused jazz, folk, and pop. Albums such as *Moxie* (featuring cabaret and electropop) and *Frost* (retro pop and disco) showcase her experimental boundary-pushing style. Produced by figures like Jimbo Mathus and Duane Lundy, her work emphasizes intimate storytelling and emotional authenticity, drawing comparisons to Joni Mitchell, Phoebe Bridgers, and Amanda Shires for its '70s singer-songwriter vibe and themes of independence and personal accountability.[1][2][4][8][9]

In New Orleans, Powell serves as Outreach & Events Manager for KID smART, leveraging her event production and educational experience, while playing jazz locally with her husband, Mike, and pursuing fiber art at home. Her multimedia approach extends *The Starter Wife* into live performances, writings, videos, and photos, reflecting a legacy of resilience and creative compulsion.[2][3][4]
