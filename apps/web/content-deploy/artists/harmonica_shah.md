## Biography
Seward Daward Shah, known as Harmonica Shah (born Thaddeus Louis Hall on March 31, 1946, in Oakland, California), grew up immersed in blues traditions through his grandfather, Sam Dawson, a harmonica and guitar player from Somerville, Texas, who recorded for Alan Lomax and Duke Records. Spending time with Dawson in Texas and hearing Oakland club performers like Lowell Fulson, Jimmy McCracklin, Juke Boy Bonner, and Big Mama Thornton as a *Jet* magazine salesman in the late 1950s sparked his passion. Shah's raw blues style was profoundly shaped by his grandfather's field hollers, which he contrasted with rock 'n' roll in interviews, emphasizing its emotional depth.[1]

Relocating to Detroit in 1967, Shah worked at Ford Motors for 15 years and drove a taxicab, purchasing his first cheap harmonica in 1976 and diving into local jam sessions with no turning back. A key figure in Detroit's blues scene during the 1980s-1990s as one of the prominent Black performers, he played alongside local legends like Bobo Jenkins, Eddie Kirkland, The Butler Twins, and Willie D. Warren. His debut album, *Motor City Mojo*, arrived in 2000 on Blue Suit Records, followed by *Deep Detroit* (2001) featuring guitarist Howard Glazer, and subsequent releases on Electro-Fi Records including *Listen at Me Good* (2006) with Mel Brown and Willie 'Big Eyes' Smith, up to *Ain't Gonna Worry About Tomorrow* (2020).[1][2]

Shah's electric blues harmonica and gritty vocals blend classic Chicago influences with Detroit grit, earning him tours across the US, Europe, Russia, Japan, and Australia. He legally changed his name to Seward Shah and occasionally performs free shows at John's Carpet House in East Detroit, maintaining ties to his roots while building a legacy as a modern blues harmonica master.[1][5]

## Fun Facts
- Shah sold *Jet* magazine as a teen, gaining entry to Oakland bars to hear blues icons like Big Mama Thornton.
- He started playing harmonica at age 30 in 1976 while driving a taxicab in Detroit, quickly hooked after local jams.
- One of the few Black blues performers prominent in Detroit's 1980s-1990s scene.
- Still performs free occasional gigs at John's Carpet House in East Detroit, near his roots.
