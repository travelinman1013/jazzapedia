## Biography
Frederick Anthony Jackson, born October 2, 1956, in Harlem, New York City, began his musical journey as a gospel singer at the White Rock Baptist Church, where he honed his skills from an early age and met Paul Laurence, who became his key collaborator. After school, he joined Laurence's group LJE (Laurence Jones Ensemble) on the New York nightclub scene, then moved to the West Coast in the late 1970s to serve as lead singer for the funk band Mystic Merlin, releasing three albums from 1980-1982 before returning to New York to work with Laurence at Hush Productions and provide backing vocals for Melba Moore.[1][4][5]

Jackson's solo breakthrough came in 1984 with a Capitol Records deal, launching his debut album *Rock Me Tonight* in 1985, featuring the title track that topped the R&B charts for six weeks and 'You Are My Lady,' earning Grammy nominations for Best New Artist and Best R&B Vocal Performance. His smooth, sultry style in the quiet storm and classic soul genres propelled follow-ups like *Just Like the First Time* (1986) and *Don't Let Love Slip Away* (1988) to platinum success, amassing 11 R&B #1 hits and ranking him among the top-selling Black artists of the 1980s and 1990s.[1][2][3]

Post-Capitol, Jackson navigated label changes with RCA, Scotti Brothers, and independents, releasing albums like *Here It Is* (1994), *Life After 30* (1999), and *Transitions* (2006), while maintaining a touring presence. In 2014, 'Love & Satisfaction' marked a resurgence, supporting international tours with peers like Jeffrey Osborne and Peabo Bryson. His legacy endures with over 50 million albums sold and a lasting impact on urban contemporary R&B.[1][3][6]
