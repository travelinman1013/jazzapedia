## Biography
The Unhinged Sextet is a collaborative jazz ensemble comprised of six accomplished performers and composers based in different regions across the United States.[1][2] Despite their geographic dispersion, the members were originally drawn together through long-standing mutual associations and a shared desire to explore their collective musical concepts.[1] The group made their debut in 2015 with the album "Clarity," recorded in Arizona after the members gathered for several days of workshopping and recording twelve original compositions.[1][4] This first meeting demonstrated remarkable chemistry among the musicians, establishing a pattern that would continue with their subsequent releases.

The ensemble is dedicated to the performance of progressive jazz through original composition, playing in a hard bop style that emphasizes accessible yet sophisticated music.[2][3][8] Rather than living and performing together, the Unhinged Sextet convenes once annually to record, which explains their unconventional name—the only reason to call them "unhinged" is their geographic separation.[2] Their second album, "Don't Blink," was released in 2017 on OA2 Records, continuing to showcase the band's cohesive unity and impressive original compositions.[2][7] The group represents educators from key music schools throughout the United States, with members holding positions at various universities.[3] Critics have consistently praised their ability to create memorable, swinging music characterized by smooth synergy and sophisticated harmonic ideas, with reviewers noting that despite the name suggesting chaos, the Unhinged Sextet produces tightly arranged, bop-based jazz of considerable merit.[2][4][6]

## Fun Facts
- Despite being called the 'Unhinged Sextet,' the group's name is somewhat ironic—critics and reviewers consistently note that the only reason to call them 'unhinged' is because the six members are scattered across different parts of the country and only convene once a year to record, not because their music is chaotic or disjointed.[2]
- The group's debut album 'Clarity' was recorded in Arizona in July 2014, and remarkably, it was the first time all the members had actually played together in person, despite having long-standing mutual associations beforehand.[4]
- All eight tracks on the 'Don't Blink' album are original compositions written by the Unhinged Sextet musicians themselves, with each member contributing to the songwriting.[9]
- The ensemble represents educators from multiple key music schools throughout the United States, with members holding faculty positions at various universities, making them a geographically dispersed but academically connected group.[3]
