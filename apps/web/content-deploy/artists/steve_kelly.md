## Biography
Steve Kelly is a New Orleans-based guitarist, songwriter, and producer known for his Americana soul sound, deeply influenced by Memphis gospel vocals, R&B horns, and the B3 organ style of Al Green, Hi Records, and Willie Mitchell. After spending over a decade establishing his reputation with the local group Gravy, Kelly launched his solo career with the 2022 album *Here's the Thing*, co-produced with Robert Mercurio of Galactic. The project snowballed during the pandemic, allowing him to collaborate with top musicians who were available due to halted tours, transforming an initial three-track EP into a full-length record inspired by personal themes of love and life's hardships.[1][4][6]

Kelly's career reflects two decades of connections in the New Orleans music scene, where he honed his craft before going solo. His style blends his adopted hometown's spirit with soulful Americana roots, evident in the diverse array of talent on his debut, including players from Govt Mule, Jimmy Herring Band, Tedeschi-Trucks Band, and Galactic. In a 2022 interview, Kelly described the album's organic growth, drawing inspiration from collaborative environments like Steely Dan records and album-driven artists such as Prince, Pink Floyd, and D'Angelo.[1][4]

While specific details on his early life remain limited in available sources, Kelly's move to New Orleans shaped his musical identity, leading to a patient build-up to his solo debut after years in local bands.
