## Biography
Sariyah Idan, born and raised in the multicultural environment of New York City with roots in Woodstock, NY, is a dynamic independent singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, poet, dancer, and educator now based in New Orleans. She holds a BA in Arts and Social Change from Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts, and an MFA in Creative Inquiry from CIIS in San Francisco, blending her academic background with a commitment to social justice through music and workshops. Trained in jazz and folk, educated by hip-hop, and influenced by Latinx/Caribbean sounds and her Jewish roots, Idan crafts a unique style that seamlessly combines disparate genres into soulful, acoustic-driven performances featuring originals and covers from soul, jazz, and world music.[1][2][3]

Idan's career as a performer and bandleader has taken her to international stages, including venues like Kennedy Center in DC, Skirball Cultural Center in LA, Nuyorican Poets Cafe and Rockwood Music Hall in NYC, Noize Fabrik in Berlin, and The Jazz Museum in New Orleans, as well as festivals such as French Quarter Fest and SisterSpace. She has shared stages with legends like Pete Seeger, Lee 'Scratch' Perry, and Yusef Lateef, and is renowned locally in New Orleans as 'the most hauntingly beautiful voice of New Orleans’ streets' from her regular street performances. Her debut LP *Breaking Shadows Glitter & Blood* (2023), a 17-track project recorded in New Orleans, explores themes of struggle, love, and social justice, with a forthcoming live album *Solo Live In Berlin* slated for spring 2025.[2]

Beyond music, Idan produces and hosts the *Songs For The People* series in New Orleans, benefiting local community organizations, developed through Music To Life’s Musician Changemaker Academy. She offers workshops on writing, performance, and singing that foster self-discovery, women's experiences, and social justice, often culminating in collaborative performances, reflecting her dedication to cultural activism and community building.[2]
