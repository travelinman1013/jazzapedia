## Biography
Yttling Jazz & Yukimi refers to a specific musical collaboration between Swedish musician Björn Yttling, under his jazz project Yttling Jazz, and Yukimi Nagano, the vocalist of Little Dragon. Björn Yttling, founding member of indie pop band Peter Bjorn and John, launched Yttling Jazz as a jazzy side project, releasing albums like *Illegal Hit* after a 20-year hiatus. Their key joint work is the 2024 single 'Distant Star,' a lounge-jazz track originating from *Illegal Hit* sessions, featuring Yukimi's vocals over toms, tap shoes, piano, bass clarinet by Nils Berg, and trumpet by Tobias Wiklund. The track blends Swedish indie with Gene Krupa-inspired jazz vibes, with lyrics co-written over the phone.[5][6][8]

Yukimi Nagano, born January 31, 1982, in Gothenburg, Sweden, to an American mother and Japanese father, developed a love for music in childhood, influenced by diverse genres like 1990s R&B, Swedish jazz, folk, and West African dance music. She began her career at 18 recording with Andreas Saag (Swell Session) and contributed vocals to Koop's 2001 album *Waltz for Koop* ('Summer Sun,' 'Bright Nights'), which opened collaboration doors. In 1996, she co-founded Little Dragon in high school with Erik Bodin (drums), Fredrik Wallin (bass), and Håkan Wirenstrand (keys), releasing their debut in 2007 after being denied music college entry. Yukimi has since earned Grammy nominations with Little Dragon, performed at major festivals like Coachella and Glastonbury, and released her 2024 solo debut *For You* on Ninja Tune, co-produced with Bodin.[1][2][3][4]

The Yttling Jazz & Yukimi collaboration highlights Yukimi's versatility, as she embraced the jazz opportunity amid her solo career, praising Björn's production and Peter Bjorn and John. Their partnership pays tribute to classic jazz while infusing modern indie and electronic elements, aligning with Yukimi's nu jazz roots from Spotify context and early Koop work.
