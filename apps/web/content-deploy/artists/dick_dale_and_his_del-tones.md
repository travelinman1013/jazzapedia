## Biography
Dick Dale, born Richard Anthony Monsour on May 4, 1937, in Boston, Massachusetts, to a Lebanese-American family, developed an early interest in music influenced by Middle Eastern scales from his heritage and the oud instrument. His family relocated to Southern California when he was 16, where he immersed himself in surfing and began translating the power and rhythm of waves into his guitar playing. A left-handed player using a right-handed Fender Stratocaster flipped upside down, Dale pioneered a percussive, staccato style with heavy reverb to mimic ocean sounds, earning him the title 'King of the Surf Guitar' from fellow surfers.[1][5][4]

In 1961, Dale and his backing band, the Del-Tones, launched their residency at the Rendezvous Ballroom in Newport Beach, California, drawing massive crowds of surfers and birthing the surf rock genre with their high-volume performances called 'stomps.' Their debut single 'Let’s Go Trippin’' on Deltone Records is recognized as the first true surf rock instrumental, followed by the signature track 'Misirlou,' a reimagined eastern Mediterranean folk song, and the album *Surfer’s Choice* (1962), which Capitol Records distributed nationally. Subsequent releases like *King of the Surf Guitar* (1963) solidified their influence, though Dale's impact was strongest locally in Southern California.[1][2][3][5]

Dale's career saw a resurgence in the 1980s and 1990s, highlighted by the 1986 collaboration 'Pipeline' with Stevie Ray Vaughan, featured in *Back to the Beach* and Grammy-nominated, and albums like *Tribal Thunder* (1993). He appeared in films such as *Beach Party* (1963) and maintained a global touring schedule into later years despite health challenges, passing away on March 16, 2019, in Loma Linda, California, from heart and kidney failure. His innovative sound profoundly shaped surf music and inspired countless guitarists across genres.[1][2][5]

- Dale played a right-handed Fender Stratocaster upside down as a lefty, contributing to his unique percussive picking style without restringing the guitar.[4][5]
- His 1961 Rendezvous Ballroom shows enforced a no-alcohol, dress code policy to secure the venue, turning them into legendary sold-out 'stomps' for surfers.[5]
- *Surfer’s Choice* (1962) was the first surfing-themed album with a cover photo of Dale surfing, selling over 88,000 copies in the late 1950s equivalent to millions today.[2]
- Dale's music directly sparked the surf craze, influencing Australia's surf scene and youth dance 'the stomp.'[1]
