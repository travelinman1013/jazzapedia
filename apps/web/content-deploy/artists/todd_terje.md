## Biography
Terje Olsen, born in 1981 in Mjøndalen, Norway, is a Norwegian DJ, songwriter, and record producer professionally known as Todd Terje, a name chosen as a homage to house music pioneer Todd Terry. Rising to prominence in the mid-2000s through a series of influential remixes and re-edits, Terje quickly became a central figure in the nu-disco and Scandinavian dance scenes. Dubbed the 'King of the summer jams' by Mixmag, 'one third of the Holy Trinity of Norwegian disco' by Spin magazine, and a prominent force by AllMusic, he broke through with tracks like 'Eurodans' (2005), 'Ragysh' (2011), 'Snooze 4 Love' (2011), and his signature hit 'Inspector Norse' (2012).[1][2][3][4][5]

Terje's career peaked with his debut album *It's Album Time* in 2014, a vibrant collection of bubbly synths, soft percussion, and celebratory electronica that blended Balearic sensibilities with disco, 80s influences, and modern dance energy, earning widespread acclaim as a masterpiece of the genre. He has headlined major festivals like Sónar, Coachella, Lowlands, and Pitchfork, often performing live with his brother Olaf Olsen on drums and percussionist Martin Windstad. Notable releases include collaborations like the single 'Lanzarote' with Lindstrøm (2013), a cover of 'Johnny and Mary' featuring Bryan Ferry, the 2016 EP *The Big Cover-Up* under Todd Terje and the Olsens, and co-writing Robbie Williams' chart-topping 'Candy'.[1][2][3][5]

Terje's legacy endures as a nu-disco innovator, with rankings like #17 on Rolling Stone's '25 DJs That Rule the Earth' and a 2013 BBC Radio 1 Essential Mix, influencing the global electronic music landscape through his joyful, summery sound and prolific remixing work.[1][2][5]
