## Biography
The Trinikas were a short-lived vocal group from Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, formed in the mid-1960s by high school students Marsha Bratton, Debbie Sheffield, Georgetta Dixon, and Lenise 'T-Bird' Morgan. Before adopting the Trinikas name, the girls sang to hospital patients as part of their junior high school's Paramedical Career Club. Debbie Sheffield, daughter of jazz pianist Leslie Sheffield—a pioneer on Oklahoma City's outer-west jazz circuit—benefited from her father's insistence that she learn piano and composition, giving the group an edge. They continued singing together at Douglas High School, where Sheffield joined after catching up with her classmates, and performed in Leroy Hicks’ choir.

In 1962, the group connected with local entrepreneur Richard Gilleland, who ran a Century Records franchise and recorded school fundraising albums. They cut an early single, 'Black Is Beautiful' b/w a duet, in his garage with Ronald Hamilton on bass and David McKinney on drums. In 1969, Gilleland took them to Cavern Studio in Independence, Missouri, to professionally record 'Black Is Beautiful' b/w 'Remember Me,' produced by Louis Chachere and released on Pearce Records. The soulful tracks, with themes of Black pride and heartfelt ballads, reflected their high school environment but saw limited promotion due to their youth. Their career ended tragically after Douglas High's 1969 fall talent show when Marsha Bratton snuck out despite restriction, performed, and died in a car accident en route to Tulsa, with her sister severely injured.

The group went on hiatus, dedicated their 1970 fundraising album to Bratton, and replaced her with Gloriadean Tucker, continuing until Sheffield and Tucker's 1971 graduation. Sheffield pursued college at Virginia Union University and a solo path, while the Trinikas faded into obscurity. Their rare 45 was reissued by Numero Group in 2012, resurfacing their story decades later.
