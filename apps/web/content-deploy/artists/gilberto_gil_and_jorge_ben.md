## Biography
Gilberto Gil and Jorge Ben are two of Brazil's most influential musicians who collaborated on the cult album *Gil & Jorge – Ogum Xangô*. Gilberto Gil was born in Salvador, Bahia in 1942 into a middle-class family and began his musical career in the early 1960s as a bossa nova musician.[3][4] He met Caetano Veloso at the Universidade Federal da Bahia in 1963, and the two began collaborating and performing together, eventually becoming key figures in the Tropicália movement of the late 1960s.[3][5] Gil's early musical style blended traditional Brazilian forms with two-step rhythms such as baião and samba, influenced by artists like Luiz Gonzaga and Jackson do Pandeiro, as well as by Jorge Ben's innovative approach.[3] During the Brazilian military regime that took power in 1964, both Gil and Veloso were seen as threats; they were held for nine months in 1969 before being forced to leave the country.[3] Gil moved to London but returned to Bahia in 1972 to continue his musical career while also working as a politician and environmental advocate.[3]

Jorge Ben, born Jorge Duílio Lima Menezes on March 22, 1939, is a Brazilian popular musician who has performed under the stage name Jorge Ben Jor since the 1980s.[1] His broad-minded and original approach to samba led him through participation in some of Brazilian popular music's most important movements, including bossa nova, Jovem Guarda, and Tropicália.[1] Ben has been called "the father of samba rock" by *Billboard* magazine, and according to American music critic Robert Christgau, Ben and his contemporary Gilberto Gil were "always ready to go further out on a beat than the other samba/bossa geniuses."[1][3] Ben's musical career took off in 1963 when he performed "Mas, que Nada!" at a club in front of a Philips recording company executive, leading to his first single release one week later.[1] His 1963 debut album *Samba Esquema Novo* was met with great acclaim, and he went on to release influential albums throughout the 1960s and 1970s, including his eponymous 1969 album during the Tropicália movement and the funk-samba fusion *África Brasil* in 1976.[1]

The mutual admiration between Gilberto Gil and Jorge Ben eventually led to their collaboration on the double LP *Gil & Jorge – Ogum Xangô*, an unusual and cult album featuring nine tracks ranging from six to fourteen minutes in length, with two songs composed at the studio: "Meu glorioso São Cristovão" by Ben and "Jurubeba" by Gil.[2] The two would not compose together again until 44 years later, when they created "Ela diz que me ama" for singer Roberta Sá, recorded in the album *Giro* in 2019.[2]
