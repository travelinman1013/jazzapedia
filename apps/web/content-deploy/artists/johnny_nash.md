## Biography
John Lester 'Johnny' Nash Jr. was born on August 19, 1940, in Houston, Texas, where he honed his vocal skills singing in his Baptist church choir from a young age. By age 13, he was a regular on local television, and in 1956-1957, while still in high school, he signed with ABC-Paramount, releasing his debut single 'A Teenager Sings the Blues' and achieving his first chart hit with a cover of 'A Very Special Love' in 1958. Marketed as a rival to Johnny Mathis, Nash also ventured into acting early on, appearing in films like the screen version of Louis S. Peterson's play. In the early 1960s, he met manager Danny Sims, and together they formed JoDa Records in 1964, releasing The Cowsills' debut single, followed by Nash's R&B Top 5 hit 'Let’s Move and Groove Together' in 1965, which gained traction in Jamaica.[1][2][3][5]

Nash's career pivoted dramatically in the mid-1960s when he traveled to Jamaica to record at Federal Studios, embracing the rocksteady and emerging reggae sounds. Around 1966-1967, introduced by Neville Willoughby, he signed Bob Marley, Bunny Wailer, Peter Tosh, and Rita Marley to his Cayman Music publishing company and formed JAD Records in 1967 with Sims and Arthur Jenkins. This led to his 1968 top-five hit 'Hold Me Tight' in the US and UK. After JAD folded in 1971, Nash signed with Epic Records, releasing his signature reggae-pop anthem 'I Can See Clearly Now' in 1972, which topped the Billboard Hot 100 for four weeks and sold over a million copies. The album of the same name featured Marley compositions like 'Stir It Up,' reaching #12. Nash also scored a UK #1 with 'Tears on My Pillow' in 1975 and had later minor successes like 'Rock Me Baby' in 1986. He gradually retired to focus on films and his West Indian recording ventures, passing away on October 6, 2020.[1][2][3][5]

Nash's musical style evolved from smooth R&B and pop ballads influenced by Sam Cooke to pioneering reggae fusion, blending upbeat pop sensibilities with Jamaican rhythms, helping introduce the genre to mainstream American and global audiences alongside his promotion of early Bob Marley material. His legacy endures through timeless hits like 'I Can See Clearly Now,' famously covered by Jimmy Cliff in *Cool Runnings* (1993) and featured in *Grosse Pointe Blank* (1997), cementing his role as a bridge between R&B, pop, and reggae.[1][2][3]
