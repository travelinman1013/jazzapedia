## Biography
Bob Howe, known as Whistlin' Bob Howe, and Frankie Griggs were a musical duo active in the early 20th-century American music scene, particularly noted for their contributions to pre-war blues and novelty recordings. They recorded tracks such as 'The Hottest Stuff In Town' and 'The Coldest Stuff In Town,' which appeared on labels like Varsity in 1940, showcasing a whistling style blended with blues elements.[2][5] Limited documentation suggests they operated within the era's regional recording circuits, capturing the raw energy of vaudeville-influenced performances, though detailed personal histories remain scarce due to the obscurity of many such artists from that period.[5]

Their career development centered around 78 RPM singles, with 'Whistlin' Bob Howe & Frankie Griggs' credited on releases that highlighted whistling as a distinctive feature alongside vocal and instrumental work. No extensive discography or tour records are widely available, and platforms like Last.fm note no events or detailed biographies, indicating a niche legacy confined to collectors and reissues.[3][5] Their musical style leaned toward upbeat, playful tunes with blues undertones, as evidenced by song titles evoking temperature-themed humor typical of the vaudeville-blues crossover.[2][5]

The duo's legacy persists through archival reissues and discographies documenting early American vernacular music, influencing collectors of pre-war blues and whistling artists, though no major mainstream impact is recorded. Their work appears in comprehensive discographies like those by Stefan Wirz, underscoring their place in the broader tapestry of 1930s-1940s independent recordings.[5]
