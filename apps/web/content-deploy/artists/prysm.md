## Biography
Prism is a Canadian rock band formed in Vancouver in 1977, evolving from the late 1960s punkish band Seeds of Time and the early 1970s jazz-rock group Sunshyne. Key founders included producer and trumpeter Bruce Fairbairn, songwriter Jim Vallance, guitarist Lindsay Mitchell, and singer Ron Tabak, who recruited keyboardist John Hall and drummer Rocket Norton. The classic lineup featured Ron Tabak on vocals, Lindsay Mitchell on guitar and vocals, John Hall on keyboards and vocals, Al Harlow on bass, guitar, slide guitar and vocals, and Rocket Norton on drums. Their debut self-titled album in 1977, produced by Vallance (under the pseudonym Rodney Higgs) and Fairbairn, spawned hits like 'Spaceship Superstar,' marking their breakthrough in Canada.[1][2][3][4]

Prism's career saw lineup changes after early successes with albums like See Forever Eyes (1978), Armageddon (1979), and Young and Restless (1980). Vallance left touring in 1977 to focus on songwriting, replaced by Norton; Tom Lavin and Ab Bryant departed, with Harlow joining in 1978. They achieved international recognition with 'Don't Let Him Know' reaching US Top 40 in 1981 and won Juno Award for Group of the Year. The band broke up in 1982 amid debts but reformed in 1988, releasing albums like Jericho (1993) and Big Black Sky (2008). Tragically, Tabak died in 1984 from a brain hemorrhage after a cycling accident. Al Harlow has kept the band active, taking lead vocals by 2003.[1][2][3][4]

Prism's musical style blends hard rock with jazz-rock fusion influences from their Sunshyne roots, characterized by anthemic singles, high harmonies, and strong songwriting. Their legacy includes launching careers of members like Fairbairn (producer for Aerosmith, Bon Jovi), Vallance (co-writer for Bryan Adams), and early contributions from a pre-fame Bryan Adams. Primarily successful in Canada with 8 albums and 21 singles, they remain active with Harlow at the helm.[3][4]

## Fun Facts
- Jim Vallance used the pseudonym 'Rodney Higgs' on Prism's debut album credits because he was a University of BC student and didn't want classmates knowing he was in a rock band.[1]
- Plans for a Prism reunion with original singer Ron Tabak were cancelled after his death on December 25, 1984, from a brain hemorrhage caused by a cycling accident the day before.[2]
- In 1982, due to band debts, ownership of the Prism name was temporarily held by bassist Al Harlow, who rebuilt the touring lineup.[4]
- A pre-fame Bryan Adams contributed compositions to Prism's Armageddon (1979) and Young and Restless (1980) albums.[2][4]
