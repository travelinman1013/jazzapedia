## Biography
Lena Mary Calhoun Horne was born on June 30, 1917, in Brooklyn, New York, into a middle-class family marked by tumult. Defying her family's wishes for higher aspirations, she began her career at age 16 in 1933 as a chorus dancer at Harlem's Cotton Club, quickly advancing to featured singer. She performed with Noble Sissle's Society Orchestra as Helena Horne in 1935, appeared in Broadway shows like 'Dance with Your Gods' (1934) and 'Blackbirds of 1939,' and briefly married Louis Jones in 1937, with whom she had two children, Gail and Edwin ('Teddy'). Racial discrimination prompted her to leave Charlie Barnet's band in 1940 after touring, leading her to Café Society Downtown in 1941.[1][3][4][5]

Horne's career flourished in Hollywood with MGM films like 'Cabin in the Sky' and nightclub performances worldwide, spanning over 60 years. She recorded from 1936 to 2000, earning three Grammys including a Lifetime Achievement Award in 1989, and won a Tony for her 1981-1982 Broadway show 'Lena Horne: The Lady and Her Music.' A civil rights activist, she participated in the 1963 March on Washington. In later years, she released jazz albums like 'We'll Be Together Again' (1994, Grammy-nominated), 'An Evening with Lena Horne' (1995, Grammy winner), and 'Being Myself' (1998), performing sporadically until retreating from public life after 1994.[2][4][5]

Known for her vocal jazz style, elegant delivery, and advocacy against racism, Horne became a legend, blending singing, acting, and activism. She passed away on May 9, 2010, leaving a legacy as a groundbreaking Black performer who broke barriers in entertainment.[3][4]
