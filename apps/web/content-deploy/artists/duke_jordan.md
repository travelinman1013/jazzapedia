## Biography
Irving Sidney "Duke" Jordan was born on April 1, 1922, in New York and raised in Brooklyn, where he attended Boys High School. He began formal piano training at age eight under a private teacher and continued studying until age 16, playing in his school band at Brooklyn Automotive High. After graduating in 1939, he joined trombonist Steve Pulliam's septet, which won a prize at the New York World's Fair and earned the attention of music impresario John Hammond. Jordan's early career included work with Coleman Hawkins and Roy Eldridge before he was discovered by Charlie Parker in 1946 while playing at the Three Deuces in New York City.

Jordan became best known as the pianist in Charlie Parker's legendary quintet from 1947 to 1948, which also featured Miles Davis on trumpet, Max Roach on drums, and Tommy Potter on bass. During this period, he participated in Parker's influential Dial and Savoy recordings, including classics such as "Embraceable You," "Dewey Square," "Bongo Bop," and "Scrapple from the Apple." His piano introductions to standards became hallmarks of the group's sound, and he developed a style reminiscent of Bud Powell and Art Tatum. After leaving Parker's band in autumn 1948, Jordan worked with saxophonists Sonny Stitt, Gene Ammons, and Stan Getz, though he found these collaborations less fulfilling.

By the mid-1950s, Jordan began leading his own bands and composing music, recording his first album as a leader in 1954 and the Blue Note classic "Flight to Jordan" in 1960. During the mid-1960s, he drove a taxi in New York to support himself while continuing to perform. In 1973, after visiting Copenhagen on a jazz tour, Jordan settled in Denmark in 1978, joining other American jazz expatriates including Dexter Gordon and Kenny Drew. He recorded more than two dozen albums for the Danish SteepleChase label between 1973 and 1985, touring and performing throughout Europe and Japan until his death on August 8, 2006, in Valby, a suburb of Copenhagen.

## Fun Facts
- At age 17, Jordan's amateur combo won a prize at the 1939 New York World's Fair, earning the attention of legendary music impresario John Hammond, who was impressed by the teenage pianist's abilities.
- When Charlie Parker was offered an engagement at the first Salon du Jazz in Paris in May 1949, he sent for Duke to rejoin the quintet. However, Parker had already hired pianist Al Haig out of anxiety about disappointing French concert promoters, leaving Jordan to return to New York empty-handed.
- During the mid-1960s, Jordan drove a taxi in Manhattan to make ends meet while continuing to pursue his music career, reflecting the financial struggles many jazz musicians faced during that era.
- Jordan's composition "Jordu" became such a popular jazz standard that it has been recorded by numerous artists across generations, cementing his legacy as both a performer and composer in the jazz canon.
