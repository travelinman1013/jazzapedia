## Biography
Sikiru Ololade Ayinde Balogun, known as Ayinde Barrister or Barry Wonder (February 9, 1948 – December 16, 2010), was born in Ibadan to a trader and butcher father, Salawu Balogun. He attended Muslim Mission School and Model School in Mushin, Lagos, and later studied typing and business at Yaba Polytechnic. Starting as an *ajiwere* singer during Ramadan, he balanced music with jobs including typist at Nigerian Breweries and clerk in the Nigerian Army during the Civil War, serving in Awka, Abagana, and Onitsha under Colonel Adeniran. After the war, he pursued music full-time, forming the Supreme Fuji Commanders band with 34 musicians and releasing his first LP in 1966 under African Songs Ltd, initially performing for Muslim audiences in Ebute Metta and Lagos.[2][3]

In 1966, Barrister pioneered Fuji music, evolving it from traditional Yoruba styles like sákárà and àpàlà into a modern genre that gained nationwide popularity by the early 1980s. He released over 70 albums through his Siky-Oluyole Records, with hits like *Fuji Disco*, *Oke Agba*, *Aiye*, *Fuji Reggae Series 2*, and the chart-topping Fuji Garbage Series. Known for fierce rivalries, especially with Kollington Ayinla, he modernized Fuji, took it international with tours starting in Britain (1978) and America (1986), and addressed social issues in albums like *Okiki*, *Reality*, *Precaution*, *Current Affairs*, *Fantasia Fuji*, and *Canadian Fuji*, advocating for civil rule and supporting MKO Abiola. His music blended Fuji, highlife, and afro adura, appealing to elites and diaspora audiences.[1][2][3][4]

Barrister's legacy as Fuji's father endures through his innovations, prolific output (about 60-70 albums from 1972-2008), and role in sustaining its foundations against hip-hop influences. He received numerous honors, including 35 chieftaincy titles (e.g., Otunbaala of Lagos in 1984, upgraded to Baala in 1991, Agbaakin Bobagunwa of Ibadan, Sarkin Waka by Kano Emirate in 1988), honorary PhD from City University Los Angeles (1983/1985), Key to Providence USA (1986), PMAN's Best Traditional Musician (1988), honorary citizenships, and Nigeria's MFR from President Obasanjo in 2006.[1][2][3]
