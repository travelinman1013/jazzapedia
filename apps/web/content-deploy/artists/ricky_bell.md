## Biography
Ricardo 'Ricky' Bell, nicknamed 'Slick,' was born on September 18, 1967, in Roxbury, Boston, Massachusetts, the youngest of eleven children, growing up in the Orchard Park projects. He began his musical career singing with close friend Ralph Tresvant in a duo called 'Ricky and Ralph,' before forming the influential R&B/pop group New Edition in 1983 alongside Michael Bivins, Bobby Brown, Tresvant, and Ronnie DeVoe. New Edition achieved massive success in the 1980s and 1990s with hits like 'Candy Girl,' 'Cool It Now,' 'Mr. Telephone Man,' 'If It Isn't Love,' and 'Can You Stand the Rain,' releasing seven studio albums despite lineup changes, including Bobby Brown's departure and Johnny Gill's addition.[1][2][3]

After New Edition's Heart Break album, Bell formed the spin-off group Bell Biv DeVoe (BBD) in 1990 with Bivins and DeVoe, at the suggestion of producer Jimmy Jam. BBD pioneered the New Jack Swing sound, blending hip-hop, R&B, and pop—described as 'Hip-Hop smoothed out on an R&B tip with a Pop feel appeal'—with their debut album Poison selling over 4 million copies and spawning the massive hit single of the same name. The group released additional albums like Hootie Mack (1993), BBD (2001), and Three Stripes (2017), establishing Bell as a dynamic lead singer capable of chart-topping success.[1][2][3]

As a solo artist, Bell released the Latin-inspired album Ricardo Campana in 2000, which received favorable reviews for showcasing his vocal versatility, though it had limited promotion. His musical style spans classic R&B, New Jack Swing, and Latin R&B influences, contributing to a legacy as a foundational figure in urban/R&B music, with New Edition earning awards like the BET Lifetime Achievement Award in 2017.[1][2][3]
