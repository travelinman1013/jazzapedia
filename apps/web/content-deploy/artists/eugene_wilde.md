## Biography
Eugene Wilde (born Ronald Eugene Broomfield on December 6, 1961) is an American R&B singer and songwriter who rose to prominence in the 1980s as part of the quiet storm and new jack swing movements.[1][2] Born and raised in North Miami Beach, Florida, Wilde began his musical career in the 1970s as part of family and local groups including La Voyage, Tight Connection, and Simplicious, performing in Miami clubs before transitioning to a solo career.[1] His early professional experience included recording with Curtom Records in 1979 as a member of the group Today, Tomorrow, Forever.[1]

Wilde achieved his greatest commercial success after joining Philly World Records in 1984, when he wrote and recorded his debut hit "Gotta Get You Home Tonight," which reached No. 1 on the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart and No. 18 on the UK Singles Chart.[1][2] He replicated this success a year later with his second No. 1 R&B hit, "Don't Say No Tonight," establishing himself as a significant figure in 1980s R&B.[1][2] Additional charting singles included "Diana" (1986), which peaked at No. 10 on the R&B chart, and "Personality" (1985), which reached No. 34 in the UK.[1][5]

Beyond his recording career, Wilde found sustained success as a songwriter and music entrepreneur starting in the 1990s. He co-wrote "I'll Never Break Your Heart" with Albert Manno for the Backstreet Boys, contributed to Britney Spears' 2000 album *Oops!... I Did It Again* with the track "Dear Diary" (co-written with Jason Blume), and wrote "I Wish" for Victoria Beckham's 2001 self-titled album.[1] In 2018, Wilde launched his own record label, 50ish Music Group, continuing his involvement in the music industry.[1] His songwriting catalog has contributed to over 60 million in record sales across his various projects.[2]
