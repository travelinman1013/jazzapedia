## Biography
Roderick Harper, born on July 20, 1966, in Washington, D.C., as the only child of doctors Ronald and Geraldine Harper, began singing almost as soon as he could speak and learned violin and trombone in elementary school, later adding clarinet and guitar in middle and high school. His introduction to jazz came through Wynton Marsalis's 'Think Of One,' which led him to explore his father's record collection. He received his first formal jazz training from John Malachi, Sarah Vaughan's accompanist, and attended Southern University and A&M College in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, majoring in Political Science with a minor in Jazz Studies, where he formed groups including one with Alvin Batiste and the Jazzstranauts, bringing him to the attention of Ellis Marsalis.[1][2][5]

Harper's career took off with performances alongside Ellis Marsalis's quartet and luminaries like Jon Hendricks, Betty Carter, Dizzy Gillespie, the Marsalis family, Joe Sample, and the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra. A defining moment was when Jon Hendricks invited him onstage for Thelonious Monk’s 'Rhythmaning,' marking his conversion to jazz. Now based in New Orleans, he blends vocal jazz with R&B, as heard in albums like 'Beautiful Beginnings' (produced by Delfeayo Marsalis), 'The Essence Of…' (produced by Nicholas Payton), 'Evolving' (featuring Ellis Marsalis and Donald Harrison), '2702' (produced by Jamison Ross), and R&B projects 'Back To Love' and its sequel, which charted highly overseas. His smooth, serious style draws praise from critics like Chicago Sun-Times' Lloyd Sachs and Baton Rouge Morning Advocate's Rod Dreher.[1][2][3][4]

Harper's legacy endures through his versatile interpretations, live recordings capturing raw emotion, and nods to influences in songs like 'Salty Dog' (Alvin Batiste), 'Never Let Me Go' (featuring Ellis Marsalis's final recording), and 'Duke Ellington’s Sound Of Love' (Mingus). His media appearances include HBO’s 'Soul of the Game,' BET’s 'BlacKout,' and commercials, reflecting a career of evolution and self-discovery in jazz and beyond.[2][3][4]
