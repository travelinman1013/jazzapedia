## Biography
Freddie Ross Jr., known as Big Freedia, was born on January 28, 1978, in Charity Hospital, New Orleans, and raised in the Third Ward of Uptown and near the Melpomene housing projects (also known as Guste Apartments). Growing up in a tough neighborhood, Freedia developed a love for performance through the choir at Pressing Onward Missionary Baptist Church, where she served as a member and later assistant director, while also attending Carter G. Woodson Middle School and Walter L. Cohen High School as a cheerleader. In the late 1990s, inspired by local bounce pioneer Katey Red, Freedia began her career as a backup dancer and singer in Red's shows, performing in clubs around New Orleans and contributing to the duo Big Freddie K Reddy before launching solo efforts.[1][2][3][5][6]

Freedia's professional breakthrough came in 1999 with her debut single 'An Ha, Oh Yeah,' followed by local hits like 'Rock Around the Clock' and 'Gin 'N My System,' and her first album *Queen Diva* in 2003. Hurricane Katrina in 2005 displaced her to Texas, where she spread bounce music awareness through performances, eventually returning to New Orleans amid rising national interest. Collaborations with DJ Rusty Lazer and funk band Galactic expanded her reach to indie, punk, and electronic audiences, leading to festival appearances, late-night TV spots, and features in *The New York Times* and *Pitchfork*. Key releases include her autobiography *God Save the Queen Diva!* (2015), EPs like *Third Ward Bounce* (2018), and albums such as *Central City* (2023), alongside high-profile features on Beyoncé's 'Break My Soul' (2022) and Drake's 'Nice For What.' Her style embodies New Orleans bounce—bass-heavy electronic dance music with rapid-fire call-and-response lyrics—popularizing twerking beyond southern Black communities.[1][3][4][5]

As the 'Queen Diva of Bounce,' Freedia has become a global ambassador for the genre, rejecting the 'sissy bounce' label in favor of inclusive bounce artistry despite her role in the LGBTQ-identified scene. Her high-energy, participatory live shows, reality TV series, and advocacy for LGBTQ rights have cemented her legacy in elevating underground New Orleans hip-hop to mainstream acclaim.[1][3][4]
