## Biography
Eurípedes Waldick Soriano (May 13, 1933 – September 4, 2008) was a Brazilian singer-songwriter born in Caetité, Bahia, who became one of the most prominent figures in the brega and bolero music styles. Before pursuing music professionally, Soriano worked in the Bahian hinterlands as a truck driver, prospector, and manual laborer until age 25. In 1959, he relocated to São Paulo and secured an opportunity at Rádio Nacional through artistic director Hélio Araújo, who also directed the Chantecler recording company. This connection proved pivotal, as Araújo gave Soriano the opportunity to record his debut song "Quem és Tu" in 1960, launching a prolific recording career that would span decades.

Soriano's musical style was characterized by deeply dramatic and sentimental songs in the dor-de-cotovelo tradition, a Brazilian genre emphasizing emotional suffering and romantic anguish. His vocal abilities and expressive delivery made him a major figure in Latin pop and bolero music throughout Brazil and beyond. He recorded 83 albums across his career, achieving numerous hits including "Tortura de Amor" (1961), "Se eu Morresse Amanhã" (1962), "A Carta" (1964), "Eu Vou ao Casamento Dela" (1964), and "Minha Última Noite" (1967). His influence extended to film, appearing in "Paixão de um Homem" (1972) and "O Poderoso Garanhão" (1973). Soriano died of prostate cancer on September 4, 2008, at age 75, leaving behind a legacy that continues to resonate in Latin pop and traditional Brazilian music circles.
