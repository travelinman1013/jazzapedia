## Biography
Miami Sound Machine was formed in 1975 by keyboardist and producer Emilio Estefan Jr. as the Miami Latin Boys, initially operating as a wedding band in Miami.[1][2] The group's trajectory changed in 1977 when Gloria Fajardo and her cousin Merci Navarro Murciano joined as vocalists after performing at a wedding reception, leading to the band's rename to Miami Sound Machine.[1][2] Estefan Jr. married Gloria Fajardo in 1978, and together they would become one of the most successful Latin crossover acts of the 1980s.[1][2] The band's early recordings were released in Spanish through CBS Discos, but their breakthrough came with the 1984 English-language album Eyes of Innocence, which featured the dance hit "Dr. Beat" and sold 500,000 copies.[2][3]

Miami Sound Machine reached their commercial and artistic peak with the 1985 album Primitive Love, which laid the foundation for Latin pop as a unified genre.[3] The album's lead single "Conga!" became a historic achievement, becoming the first single to simultaneously chart on Billboard's pop, Latin, soul, and dance charts.[2] This was followed by their 1987 album Let It Loose (billed as "Gloria Estefan and Miami Sound Machine"), which produced additional hits like "Rhythm Is Gonna Get You" and "1-2-3," establishing ballads as a key element of their sound.[2][3] The group's trajectory was interrupted on March 20, 1990, when a semi-truck collided with their tour bus, severely injuring Gloria Estefan's spine and requiring 400 stitches and two titanium rods.[2]

After a year-long recovery, Miami Sound Machine returned with a renewed focus on traditional Latin music, releasing the Grammy-winning album Mi Tierra in 1993, which featured original compositions based on Cuban music from the 1930s-1950s.[2] This was followed by another Grammy-winning album, Abriendo Puertas, in 1995.[2] While Gloria Estefan continued as a solo artist from 1989 onward, Emilio Estefan Jr. became instrumental in shaping the Latin Boom of the late 1990s and early 2000s, producing and writing for artists including Jon Secada, Thalia, Alejandro Fernandez, Shakira, Ricky Martin, Jennifer Lopez, and Marc Anthony.[3] The band's legacy fundamentally transformed Latin music's presence in mainstream American pop culture.

## Fun Facts
- Gloria Estefan and Emilio Estefan Jr. met when Gloria and her cousin Merci Navarro were guest vocalists at a wedding where Emilio's band was performing in 1977, and they married just one year later in 1978.[1][2]
- "Conga!" from the 1985 album Primitive Love made history by becoming the first single ever to simultaneously appear on Billboard's pop, Latin, soul, and dance charts, establishing a new crossover standard.[2]
- Gloria Estefan's 1990 tour bus accident was catastrophic—a semi-truck collided with their stopped bus, breaking her back so severely that her surgery required 400 stitches and two titanium rods were placed along both sides of her spine, yet she made a full recovery.[2]
- The band's comeback album Mi Tierra (1993), released after Gloria's recovery, marked a deliberate artistic shift toward traditional Cuban music from the 1930s-1950s and won a Grammy Award for Best Tropical Latin Album, demonstrating their artistic evolution beyond dance-pop.[2]
