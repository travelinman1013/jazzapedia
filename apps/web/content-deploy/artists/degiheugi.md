## Biography
Degiheugi (pronounced D.J.E.J), a French beatmaker and producer, began his musical journey in 1998 as part of a rap crew, where he immersed himself in vinyl records and DJing on turntables. By 2001, he acquired his first sampler and transitioned into production, quickly finding traditional hip-hop too limiting for his expansive creativity. As a sound collector and sample explorer, he reinvented sampling by blending forgotten vinyl gems from past decades—soul-funk, orchestral '60s and '70s sounds, tropical samba, romantic strings, jazzy bass, and hip-hop beats—creating a signature style that expands trip-hop with soulful reflections, electronic melancholy, and melodic bursts.[1][2][5]

Pioneering royalty-free licensing amid France's early 2000s streaming rise, Degiheugi released numerous albums featuring high-profile collaborators like Chill Bump, Ceschi, Astronautalis, ASM, and Hugo Kant, amassing over 35 million streams internationally. In 2015, he founded his label Endless Smile alongside his fourth album of the same name. After 10 albums and 3 EPs, including a remix album with beatmakers such as The Architect, DJ Vadim, Scratch Bandits Crew, ProleteR, Souleance, and Mounika, plus an orchestral project, he returned to hip-hop roots with 'Everything’s Fine' on March 14, 2025, in collaboration with rapper Miscellaneous (from Chill Bump).[2]

Degiheugi's legacy lies in his masterful, genre-blending patchworks that redefine hip-hop and trip-hop boundaries, earning a global audience through pure, evocative soundscapes that evoke escape and emotional depth, as seen in albums like 'Foreglow' (2021), which drew from samba, Afrobeat, soul, and French chanson during the 2020 lockdown.[2][5]
