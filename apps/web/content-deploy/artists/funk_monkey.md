## Biography
Funk Monkey is a New Orleans-based supergroup formed in 2013 by Greg Hicks (trombone) from Bonerama and Bert Cotton (guitar), who brought together several of the Big Easy's finest musicians to create something distinct from their other popular projects. The band's lineup includes Brad Walker on saxophone, Rik Fletcher on keyboards, David Pomerleau on bass, and Eddie Christmas on drums, along with additional personnel including Michael Skinkus on percussion and Casandra Faulconer on bass. The group quickly evolved from sounding like a super-jam mashup into a tight-knit unit with a distinctive sound, performing regularly at prestigious New Orleans venues including Tipitina's, the Maple Leaf, and the Blue Nile, as well as major festivals like the French Quarter Festival and Mid-City Bayou Boogaloo.

Funk Monkey's musical style blends second-line funk, soul, and boogaloo with sophisticated jazz elements, creating what has been described as a ferocious-yet-groovy brand of funk. The band released their self-titled EP in November 2014 on an independent label, featuring five instrumental tracks including "Higga Boom," "Soul Brownies," "Chief'n," "Green Room," and "Tootie Ma." The EP was expertly produced by Tracey Freeman along with Hicks and Cotton, who wrote the bulk of the material. In 2018, the group released their first full-length CD, "Rollin' Live @ The Leaf," which combined the infectious enthusiasm of New Orleans street music with the polished playing of premier musicians. The band's music honors the heritage of New Orleans while showcasing the diverse talents of its high-caliber members.
