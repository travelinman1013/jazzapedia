## Biography
The James Bond Sextet was a studio-only jazz group formed in 1966 by veteran bassist Jimmy Bond (full name James Edward Bond Jr., born January 27, 1933, died April 26, 2012) to capitalize on the mid-1960s James Bond film mania. Jimmy Bond, a prominent figure on the Los Angeles jazz scene since the early 1950s, assembled top session musicians including drummer John Guerin, pianist Joe Parnello, flutist/saxophonist Buddy Collette, tenor saxophonist Harold Land, and trumpeter Bobby Bryant for their sole album, The James Bond Songbook, released on Mirwood Records. The album featured jazz interpretations of Bond themes like Thunderball and Goldfinger, alongside originals by Bond and Warren Baker for as-yet-unfilmed movies such as Moonraker and The Man with the Golden Gun[1][2][4][5].

Jimmy Bond's career spanned decades of high-caliber collaborations, beginning with stints in Chet Baker's mid-1950s band and live performances with Gene Ammons and Charlie Parker, evolving into a key role in Ella Fitzgerald's band. In the 1960s, he shifted to prolific studio work with artists like Phil Spector, Frank Zappa, Fred Neil, Tim Buckley, and the Jazz Crusaders, showcasing his versatility as a double bassist, arranger, and composer across jazz, blues, folk, and rock[1][2]. The Sextet's swinging, sophisticated jazz style—marked by intricate bass-tenor interactions and bossa nova rhythms—reflected LA's elite session talent, elevating what could have been a mere cash-in to a musically substantial effort[1].

Though the Sextet existed only for this one project and left no further legacy as a performing ensemble, Jimmy Bond's contributions endured through his extensive sessionography and the album's enduring appeal among Bond and jazz enthusiasts. The James Bond Songbook remains a notable artifact of 1960s spy fever, blending film nostalgia with West Coast jazz prowess[1][3][4].
