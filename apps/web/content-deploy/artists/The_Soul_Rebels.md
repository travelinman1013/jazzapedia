## Biography
The Soul Rebels, a pioneering New Orleans brass band, formed in 1991 when drummers Lumar LeBlanc and Derrick 'Oops' Moss, along with other young musicians from the Harold Dejan’s Young Olympia Brass Band, sought to break from traditional brass band conventions. Under the tutelage of Milton Batiste, co-director of Dejan’s Olympia Brass Band, they learned classic repertoire but were inspired by contemporary funk, hip-hop, rap, and pop influences like Parliament-Funkadelic, Public Enemy, and N.W.A. Their big break came opening for Cyril Neville of the Neville Brothers at Tipitina’s, where he named them 'The Soul Rebels' after Bob Marley's song, recognizing their funky, soulful twist on brass traditions.[1][2][3][4][5]

The band quickly developed a signature style fusing New Orleans brass band sounds with hip-hop beats, raps over instrumentals, jazz, reggae, funk, and more, releasing their debut album *Let Your Mind Be Free* in 1994 on Mardi Gras Records, followed by *No More Parades* in 1998 on Tuff City, which marked their embrace of original hip-hop-infused brass music. Despite lineup changes—including Marcus 'Red' Hubbard joining in 1999, Erion Williams in 2005, and others in 2010—and the devastation of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, which scattered members, they persisted, averaging 250 shows yearly and releasing albums like *Rebelution* (2005), *Urban Legend* (2006), and later works blending their sound with major artists. Today, the eight-piece ensemble, featuring LeBlanc and Moss on percussion, trumpeters Julian Gosin and Marcus Hubbard, trombonists Corey Peyton and Paul Robertson, saxophonist Erion Williams, and sousaphonist Manuel Perkins Jr., remains a global force in redefining brass music.[1][2][3][4][6]

Their legacy lies in elevating non-traditional brass band music to mainstream stages, backing hip-hop icons like Nas, GZA, Rakim, Wu-Tang Clan, and others while producing original material, thus bridging New Orleans street parades with arena-level hip-hop energy and preserving brass heritage through innovation.[2][6]
