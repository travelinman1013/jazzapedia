## Biography
Lisa Lisa & Cult Jam emerged as one of the pioneering forces of freestyle music in the 1980s, originating from Brooklyn, New York. The group consisted of Lisa Velez (born January 15, 1966), drummer and keyboardist Mike Hughes, and guitarist and bassist Alex "Spanador" Moseley. Assembled and produced by the Brooklyn production team Full Force, the trio was formed in 1985 after Velez successfully auditioned for the group. Their debut single, "I Wonder If I Take You Home," released in 1985, quickly climbed to the R&B top ten in the US and top 20 in the UK, establishing the group as major commercial forces and helping to launch freestyle music from underground clubs into mainstream recognition. Their self-titled debut album went platinum, setting the stage for unprecedented success throughout the decade.

The group achieved their greatest commercial success with their 1987 album *Spanish Fly*, which spawned two number-one hits: "Head to Toe" and "Lost in Emotion." These tracks blended Motown influences with freestyle's signature sound, incorporating elements reminiscent of the Supremes and the 5th Dimension. The album peaked at number seven on the pop charts and went platinum, establishing Lisa Lisa as the first Latin platinum artist to be recognized nationwide. Throughout the late 1980s, the group released additional successful albums including *Straight to the Sky* (1989) and *Straight Outta Hell's Kitchen* (1991), the latter featuring the club hit "Let the Beat Hit 'Em," which reached the top 40 on the US pop chart and was produced in collaboration with C&C Music Factory.

The group disbanded in 1991 as the musical landscape shifted toward new sounds merging dance and hip-hop. Lisa Velez pursued solo and acting careers, releasing her solo album *LL77* in 1994 on Chrysalis Records, which included the Top 40 hit "Skip to My Lu." She later appeared on Nickelodeon's *Taina* (2001) and signed with Snoop Dogg's Army in June 2019. In February 2025, Lifetime premiered the biopic *Can You Feel The Beat: The Lisa Lisa Story*, with Lisa Lisa starring as her own mother, cementing her legacy as a transformative figure in 1980s pop and Latin music.
