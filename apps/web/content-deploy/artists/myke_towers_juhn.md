## Biography
Michael Anthony Torres Monge, known professionally as Myke Towers, was born on January 15, 1994, in Río Piedras, Puerto Rico. As a teenager, he immersed himself in Puerto Rico's underground rap scene, initially performing under the name Mike Towers and uploading freestyles and compositions to SoundCloud, drawing inspiration from hip-hop legends like Biggie and 2Pac while growing up with reggaeton 'in the cradle.' His career gained traction with the 2016 mixtape El Final del Principio, produced by G Starr Entertainment, which peaked at number 12 on the Latin Rhythm Albums chart and topped iTunes, featuring singles like 'Dinero en mano' and 'No sabe nada.'[1][2]

Towers transitioned to broader success by blending trap latino and reggaeton, achieving his first global hit with Farruko on 'Si Se Da' in 2019, which opened international doors. His debut studio album, Easy Money Baby, released on January 23, 2020—shortly after his son's birth—topped the Top Latin Albums chart for 83 weeks and earned a Latin Grammy nomination for Best Urban Music Album. Follow-up releases like the EP Para Mi Ex (2020), Lyke Mike (2021, with 23 tracks honoring Michael Jordan), La Vida Es Una (2023, featuring J Balvin, Ozuna, and Daddy Yankee, with 'Lala' topping global charts via TikTok), and La Pantera Negra (2024, with Peso Pluma and others) solidified his status. Recognized as Billboard's New Artist of the Year in 2021, he is co-managed by One World International and S10 Entertainment.[2][3][6]

Towers' piercing rap flow adapts across genres, from underground español rap to commercial reggaeton and pop collaborations with artists like Cardi B, Bad Bunny, and Maluma. His work reflects a return to roots on projects like Lyke Mike while embracing a 'winner's mentality' inspired by Michael Jordan, contributing to his Spotify popularity of 71 in trap latino and reggaeton genres.[3][4]
