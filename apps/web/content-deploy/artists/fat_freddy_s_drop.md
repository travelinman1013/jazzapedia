## Biography
Fat Freddy's Drop is a seven-piece dub and reggae band formed in Wellington, New Zealand, in 1999 by musicians from various local acts, initially as a jam band experimenting with live instrumentation during DJ sets by Chris Faiumu (DJ Fitchie or DJ Mu). Emerging from Wellington's vibrant music scene, the group drew from influences across black music genres including soul, dub, jazz, rhythm and blues, techno, and more, with key early tracks like 'Midnight Marauders' and 'Hope' gaining traction through local radio and DJ networks. Their breakthrough came in 2003 when 'Midnight Marauders' spread internationally via German labels, leading to European tours and solidifying their reputation for euphoric, improvised live performances honed over years on the road.[1][2][3][4]
