## Biography
The Belle Stars were an all-female British pop/rock band formed in 1980 in London, England, emerging from the breakup of the 2-Tone ska band The Bodysnatchers. Original members included guitarists Sarah-Jane Owen and Stella Barker, saxophonist Miranda Joyce, keyboardist Penny Leyton, drummer Judy Parsons, bassist Lesley Shone, and lead vocalist Jennie Matthias (also known as Jennie Bellestar), with early involvement from Black Sabbath keyboardist Gerald Woodroffe. Their first performance occurred on Christmas Day 1980 before they settled on a name, quickly gaining traction in London's music scene and signing with Stiff Records, which featured acts like Madness.[1][2][3][4]

## Fun Facts
- Their first live performance was on Christmas Day 1980, before the band had even chosen its name.[1][2][3]
- "Iko Iko" became a major US hit in 1989 after featuring in the *Rain Man* soundtrack, a favorite of Dustin Hoffman, reaching #14 on the Billboard Top 100 despite being released years earlier.[2][4]
- After most members left, the remaining trio of Sarah-Jane Owen, Miranda Joyce, and Lesley Shone continued as a three-piece, adopting a Bananarama-style unison singing approach and scoring a US dance chart hit with "World Domination" at #2 in 1986.[1][2][4]
- In 2019, four previously unreleased tracks from an abandoned second album were released as *Turn Back the Clock*.[4]
