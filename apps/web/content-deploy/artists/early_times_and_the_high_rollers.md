## Biography
Early Times, originally from Sacramento, California, emerged as a prominent figure in the local music scene during his youth, operating the internationally distributed record label Fantasia Music and releasing albums such as *Society for the Misunderstood* (named Best CD in Sac This Week), *Hobo Deluxe*, *The Comedown*, and *Tickle Your Fancy*. He garnered an unprecedented 10 nominations at the Sacramento Area Music Awards (Sammies), more than any other artist, including categories like Best Rock Musician/Vocalist, Best Singer/Songwriter, Best Rock Band, Best Blues Band, and Best Local CD, and received the Critics’ Choice Award as Sacramento’s Best Guitarist. Early Times also played in a jazz combo with future blues heavyweight Johnny Heartsman and served as lead guitarist on E.C. Scott's Blind Pig Records albums *Hard Act to Follow* and *Masterpiece*, touring nationally and in Greece with her.[1][2][3]

Transitioning to a multifaceted career, Early Times moved to New York in 1998, where he runs Manhattan Recording and Dealer’s Choice Records from his East Side studio, drawing inspiration from neighborhood characters for his songwriting. In 2001, he became a pioneering deejay on Sirius Satellite Radio's Blues channel, hosting a daily show until 2008 with guests like Buddy Guy, Elvis Costello, Allen Toussaint, John Hammond, and Jonny Lang; he returned in 2016 to host on B.B. King’s Bluesville on SiriusXM, featuring artists such as George Thorogood, Kenny Wayne Shepherd, Bobby Rush, Popa Chubby, and Jimmie Vaughan. His blues-rock style, described as that of a 'street poet,' blends scorching guitar work, personal vocals, and Americana influences, evident in albums like *Hit & Run* (2017), *The Corner* (2020), and *Electric City*.[1][2][3][4]

Early Times & The High Rollers represent his current band project, delivering original blues-rock material that has earned critical praise for its authenticity and energy, positioning him as an enigmatic yet respected voice in the blues world with a legacy bridging performance, radio, and independent production.[1][2][5]
