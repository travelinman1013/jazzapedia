## Biography
Tyron Benoit hails from Houma, Louisiana, where he grew up immersed in a rich musical environment spanning classic country, Cajun folk, and rock influences.[1] His early musical foundation included listening to George Jones, Hank Williams, Merle Haggard, Waylon Jennings, and Ernest Tubb around the house, while his grandfather's home introduced him to Cajun and folk traditions.[1] Before pursuing music professionally, Benoit served his country as a U.S. Marine in Operation Desert Storm.[1][3] After returning home, he moved to New York City to study acting, where he began writing songs with his brother Tate over speakerphone while Tate was living in Colorado.[1][3] This creative partnership led to the formation of Too Fish, a regional blues and rock band that became a hometown favorite in Colorado and the Midwest, with Tyron on guitar, Tate on bass, and rotating drummers.[1][3]

In 2003, Benoit returned to New Orleans, arriving two years before Hurricane Katrina devastated the city.[3][4] Rather than leaving, he became deeply involved in rebuilding efforts, and during this period of heavy construction work, he began holding jam sessions powered by generators on job sites with other contractors, forming a group called the Bywater Rock Group.[1][3][4] This experience catalyzed a major artistic evolution as he immersed himself in New Orleans' diverse musical community, exploring reggae, funk, blues, and rock.[1][4] A significant milestone came when he led a band for Mardi Gras Indian legend Big Chief Monk Boudreaux, solidifying his place in New Orleans' storied music history.[1][4]

Benoit has established himself as a versatile singer, guitarist, accordionist, and songwriter with a distinctive sound incorporating country, blues, classic rock, and Louisiana Zydeco.[6] His debut album "Waiting on Friday" was released in May 2022, produced by Grammy-nominated, Oscar-winning producer Donald Markowitz and featuring accomplished session musicians including guitarist Shane Theriot, drummer Doug Belote, keyboardist David Torkanowsky, and bassist Kevin Scott.[3] Since the album's release, he has performed at major festivals including French Quarter Fest, the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, Telluride Blues & Brews, Lucerne Blues Festival in Switzerland, Durango Blues Train, and Beaver Creek Blues, Brews, and BBQ.[1][3][4]
