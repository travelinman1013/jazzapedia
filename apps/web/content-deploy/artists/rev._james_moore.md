## Biography
James Leslie Moore Sr., known as Rev. James Moore, was born on February 1, 1956, in Detroit, Michigan, a hub of gospel music. At age seven, he gave his first church performance, and under the guidance of Elma Lois Hendrix Parham, he joined the Church of God in Christ (COGIC), where he honed his skills studying under gospel legends like Dr. Mattie Moss Clark. Parham also introduced him to influential figures such as Rev. James Cleveland and Andraé Crouch, shaping his traditional gospel style rooted in COGIC traditions while appreciating emerging contemporary sounds.[1][2][4]

Moore launched his professional career in 1974 at age 17, debuting with 'Thank You Master' on Savoy Records after receiving the Thurston Frazier Scholarship at the Gospel Music Workshop of America (GMWA). He achieved widespread acclaim in the 1980s and 1990s with Malaco Records, highlighted by the 1988 live album 'Rev. James Moore Live,' which topped charts and earned a Stellar Award, and collaborations like 'Live with the Mississippi Mass Choir' in 1990, featuring duets with Franklin Delano Williams. His powerful vocals shone on hits like 'Bread of Heaven' and 'Joy,' blending heartfelt worship with chart success.[1][2][3]

Diagnosed with colon cancer and diabetes in the mid-1990s, Moore continued ministering despite health challenges that left him wheelchair-bound, blind, and on dialysis. His final album, 'Family and Friends, Live in Detroit' (1999, released 2000), featured artists like Vanessa Bell Armstrong. He passed away on June 7, 2000, at age 44, leaving a legacy of chart-topping albums, Stellar and Grammy nominations, and profound influence in traditional gospel.[1][3][5]
