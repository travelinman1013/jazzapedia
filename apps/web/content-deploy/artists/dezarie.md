## Biography
Dezarie, a roots reggae singer born in Saint Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands, grew up in a musical family where singing was a constant presence, starting her performances in church and school. As a young adult, she moved to Atlanta, where she began recording dubplates for sound systems and immersed herself in reggae, drawing inspiration from artists like Capleton, Sizzla, Luciano, and Tanya Stephens. Life challenges in Atlanta led her to explore spiritual philosophies, including Rastafari, which profoundly shaped her conscious lyrics focused on liberation, self-knowledge, African heritage, social justice, and resistance to oppression.[1][2][3][5]

Her career breakthrough came in the late 1990s and early 2000s within the Virgin Islands reggae movement. Discovered for her unique voice, she collaborated closely with the band Midnite, who encouraged and produced her debut album *FYA* (also referred to as *Fire*) in 2001, featuring powerful tracks like 'Most High.' That year, she won Atlanta's 'Best New Female Reggae Artist' award before returning to St. Croix. Subsequent albums like *Gracious Mama Africa* (released on Afrikan Roots Lab) elevated her commanding vocals and messages of racial equality and anti-colonialism, backed by Midnite's signature sound with musicians such as Phillip Merchant on bass, Dion Hopkins on drums, Ron Benjamin on keyboards, and Abijah on guitar.[2][3][4][5][7]

Dezarie's uncompromising style has made her a central figure in conscious roots reggae, known as the 'Reggae Queen of Saint Croix.' She remains connected to her roots, using music for healing and awareness, influencing the global reggae diaspora through performances and albums that blend traditional rhythms with profound spiritual conviction.[1][2][6]
