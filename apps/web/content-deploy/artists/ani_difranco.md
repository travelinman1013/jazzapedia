## Biography
Angela Maria 'Ani' DiFranco was born on September 23, 1970, in Buffalo, New York, where she grew up and began playing guitar at age nine, performing Beatles covers in local bars by age 15. Starting gigs as a teenager in the 1980s, she relocated to New York City after high school, took poetry classes at The New School, and met mentor Sekou Sundiata. At 19, in 1989, she founded her own record label, Righteous Babe Records, embodying the DIY ethos, and released her self-titled debut album in 1990, distributing it initially through college networks and women's music outlets.[1][2][6][7]

DiFranco's career developed through relentless touring, initially solo and as a duo with drummer Andy Stochansky in the early 1990s, expanding to larger ensembles including bassist Sara Lee (1996), and later Jason Mercer, Julie Wolf, and Daren Hahn (1998-2002). Known for anti-folk and singer-songwriter styles infused with punk, funk, hip hop, jazz, soul, and electronica, she has released over 20 albums, maintained independence by avoiding major labels, and built a grassroots following via word-of-mouth and women's organizations. Her activism includes 'Vote Dammit!' tours, lobbying against nuclear power, and marches like the 2004 March for Women's Lives.[1][2][4]

DiFranco's legacy as a feminist icon and Grammy winner includes producing for others, Broadway debut as Persephone in Hadestown (2024), a bestselling memoir No Walls and the Recurring Dream (2019), and children's books. She has earned awards like the A2IM Lifetime Achievement Award (2017), John Lennon Real Love Award (2021), and Woody Guthrie Award, inspiring independent artists through Righteous Babe's success.[1][2][3]
