## Biography
Vienna Carroll, a Black singer, storyteller, playwright, actor, historian, and herbalist, developed her musical foundation through family traditions, particularly learning from her great grandmother who played guitar while listening to the Grand Ole Opry. Her rich soulful sound draws from her Black church roots, early Black folk songs including spirituals, work songs, prison blues, and sea chanteys, as well as folksy blues and soulful funk. She earned a BA in African American Studies from Yale University, where she deepened her focus on early Black music traditions that preceded jazz, such as work songs, prison songs, and spirituals.

As the leader of Vienna Carroll & the Folk, a blues group based in New York, she blends authentic folk spirituals with modern African diaspora grooves, featuring traditional vocals, lilting guitar, washboard, and funky bass, as heard in their single 'I Know I Been Changed.' Beyond music, Carroll has written plays and contributed to a museum exhibit on African American life in pre-Emancipation America, using her passion for masterful storytelling to light a fire in audiences. Her multifaceted career reflects a commitment to preserving and innovating Black roots music.

Vienna Carroll's legacy lies in bridging old world traditions with contemporary sounds, educating through her Folk First: Black Roots Music project and performances that honor the precursors to jazz and blues.
