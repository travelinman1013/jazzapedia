# Bruce Hornsby & The Range

## Biography
Bruce Randall Hornsby, born November 23, 1954, in Williamsburg, Virginia, grew up immersed in music, taking piano lessons from age seven and forming his first band in sixth grade. He studied music at the University of Richmond, the University of Miami, and Berklee College of Music, developing a style blending rock, jazz, bluegrass, and folk. After college, he played in local Virginia clubs, moved to Los Angeles in 1980 as a session musician and staff songwriter for 20th Century-Fox, and toured as a keyboardist for Sheena Easton in 1983.[1][3][4][5][6]

In 1984, Hornsby formed Bruce Hornsby & The Range with David Mansfield (guitar, mandolin, violin), George Marinelli (guitars, backing vocals), Joe Puerta (bass, backing vocals), and John Molo (drums), signing with RCA Records in 1985. Their debut album, The Way It Is (1986), achieved multi-platinum success, with the title track topping the Billboard Hot 100, addressing social issues like homelessness and racism through an iconic piano-driven sound. Hits like 'Mandolin Rain' and 'Every Little Kiss' followed, earning a Grammy for Best New Artist in 1987. Subsequent albums Scenes from the Southside (1988) and A Night on the Town (1990) continued their success, though Hornsby's evolving jazzier style led to the band's disbandment in 1991.[1][2][3][4][5]

Post-Range, Hornsby pursued a diverse solo career, collaborating across genres, touring with the Grateful Dead (1990-1992), and winning further Grammys for bluegrass ('The Valley Road,' 1990) and pop instrumental ('Barcelona Mona' with Branford Marsalis, 1993). His legacy endures through innovative piano work, genre fusion dubbed the 'Virginia sound,' and enduring hits sampled in hip-hop.[2][3][4][7]

## Fun Facts
- The Range opened for major acts like the Grateful Dead, Steve Winwood, John Fogerty, Huey Lewis, and Eurythmics before headlining, supported by Crowded House.
- 'The Way It Is' exploded first on BBC Radio One in England before U.S. success, selling three million copies worldwide.
- Hornsby has three Grammy wins but jokes about ten losses, spanning Best New Artist (1987), Best Bluegrass Recording (1990), and Best Pop Instrumental (1993).
- He toured as Grateful Dead keyboardist replacing Brent Mydland from 1990-1992, marking a shift from pop to jam band scenes.
