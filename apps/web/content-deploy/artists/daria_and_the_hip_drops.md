## Biography
Daria Dzurik, the dynamic frontwoman, singer, songwriter, steel pannist, pianist, and keyboardist of Daria & The Hip Drops, hails from Tallahassee, Florida, where she studied music at Florida State University. Originally a drummer, vocalist, and songwriter, Dzurik relocated to New Orleans around 2010, forming the band that fuses the grit of alternative rock with Caribbean tropical tones, including calypso, soca, reggae, ska, and New Orleans funk. Inspired by the 'Hip Drop' song and dance from the 1960s New Orleans funk band The Explosions, the group draws from influences like No Doubt, Talking Heads, Toots & the Maytals, Arctic Monkeys, and Vampire Weekend, creating uplifting, rebellious hooks driven by resonant steel drum beats.[1][2][3][4][7][8]

The band developed as a core collaboration between Daria Dzurik and producer, bassist, arranger Graham Robinson, alongside a guitarist and drummer, delivering high-energy performances that blend indie-pop, funk, and island rhythms. Their debut album 'Hipnotic' released in 2015 achieved roaring success, earning them recognition as one of Jimmy Buffett’s favorite bands. Daria & The Hip Drops have carved a niche in the New Orleans scene, sharing stages with acts like Tank & the Bangas, Dumpstaphunk, and Cowboy Mouth, and closing the Lagniappe stage at Jazz Fest in 2022 post-COVID. They released a second album, the single 'Day Too Long' (noted in reviews around 2021-2023), and were working on a new album slated for 2024.[1][2][3][4][5]

Known for their feel-good vibes and danceable sound that embodies New Orleans' 'Northernmost Caribbean city' spirit, the band continues to energize audiences with live shows emphasizing unity through music amid life's challenges. Daria emphasizes recording in traditional rock and pop styles while infusing Caribbean elements via her steel pan, fostering a bricolage of styles that keeps crowds moving.[1][4][5]
