## Biography
Southern Culture on the Skids, also known as SCOTS, is an American rock band formed in 1983 in Chapel Hill, North Carolina by guitarist and founding member Rick Miller, who had completed an art degree at the University of North Carolina. The band's initial lineup featured Miller on guitar, Stan Lewis on vocals, Leslie Land on bass, and Chip Shelby on drums. They released their debut EP Voodoo Beach Party in 1984 and a self-titled album in 1985 on the indie label Lloyd Street Records. The name originated from a conversation between Miller and his roommate about a radio broadcast, with Miller recalling: "I looked at my roommate and we said, 'Gawd, if that's the sound of the 'new South' I preferred it when it was on the skids.'"

After their early releases, the band underwent significant lineup changes due to a perceived lack of direction. Stan Lewis departed in 1987, followed by Leslie Land, leaving Rick Miller as the primary creative force. Mary Huff joined on bass and vocals, and Dave Hartman became the drummer, with both musicians from Roanoke, Virginia. This trio solidified the band's signature "swamp rock" sound and released Too Much Pork for Just One Fork in 1991 on Moist Records, establishing their reputation for humorous, sexually charged lyrics and tales of Southern culture. Keyboard player Chris 'Cousin Crispy' Bess joined for the 1997 album Plastic Seat Sweat on Geffen Records, which expanded their sonic palette but ultimately led to the band's departure from the major label after Geffen sought radio-friendly hits and touring partnerships with ska-punk bands—offers SCOTS declined.

Since the late 1990s, Southern Culture on the Skids has maintained a prolific career as an independent act, consistently touring and recording for a dedicated fanbase. The band has released numerous albums including live recordings and cover collections, with their music featured in films, television, and commercials. In 2014, the University of North Carolina's Southern Folklife Collection honored the band with an exhibition celebrating their musical and cultural contributions. Rolling Stone has described their legendary live performances as "a hell raising rock and roll party," and their work has been parodied by Weird Al Yankovic, cementing their status as influential figures in American roots rock and alternative country.
