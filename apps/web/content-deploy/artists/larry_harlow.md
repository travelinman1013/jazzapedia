## Biography
Lawrence Ira Kahn, known as Larry Harlow, was born on March 20, 1939, in Brooklyn, New York, specifically in the Brownsville section, into a Jewish-American musical family. His father, Buddy Kahn, was a mambo musician who led the house band at New York's Latin Quarter club, while his mother sang opera, immersing young Harlow in diverse sounds. He studied classical piano and, funded by his bar mitzvah, traveled to pre-Castro Cuba in the 1950s, where he immersed himself in authentic Afro-Cuban music, son, and rumba, rejecting the Europeanized mambo styles of the Catskills circuit. To gain respect in the Latin music community, he became initiated into the Afro-Caribbean religion of Santería, earning the affectionate nickname 'El Judío Maravilloso' (The Marvelous Jew) for his devotion to Arsenio Rodríguez, the blind Afro-Cuban bandleader known as 'El Ciego Maravilloso.'

Harlow's career exploded with his 1965 debut album *Heavy Smokin'*, featuring a rare female conga drummer, and he became a pioneer with Fania Records, the first artist signed by founders Johnny Pacheco and Jerry Masucci. As a pianist, multi-instrumentalist (flute, oboe, vibraphone, bass, violin, percussion), bandleader, composer, and producer of over 260 releases, he shaped salsa by blending jazz, rock, funk, and Cuban genres like son and guaracha. Innovations included introducing the batá drum from Santería rites, electric instruments like clavinet and Fender Rhodes on *Electric Harlow* (1971), pioneering two-trumpet/two-trombone frontlines, and creating the world's first Latin opera *Hommy* (1972), a salsa take on *Tommy* that revived Celia Cruz's career with 'Gracia Divina.' Key albums like *A Tribute to Arsenio Rodríguez*, *Abran Paso*, *Salsa* (1974), and *La Raza Latina: A Salsa Suite* (1976) documented Afro-Latin history and advanced the genre.[1][2][3][4][5]

A founding member of the Fania All-Stars, Harlow produced the landmark documentary *Our Latin Thing* (1972), launched careers through his orchestra, and produced the first New York all-female salsa orchestra, Latin Fever. In 1994, he co-founded the Latin Legends Band with Ray Barretto and others to educate youth on Latin music heritage. He advocated for the Latin Grammy Awards, receiving the Trustees Award in 2008. Harlow continued innovating through the 2000s until his death on August 20, 2021, at age 82, cementing his legacy as a New York salsa legend who bridged cultures and pushed boundaries.[1][2][3][5][6]
