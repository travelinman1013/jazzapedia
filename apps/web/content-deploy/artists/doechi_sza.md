## Biography
Doechii, born and raised in Tampa, Florida, attended Howard W. Blake High School where she studied choral music and explored diverse art forms including ballet, tap dancing, acting, cheerleading, gymnastics, and soccer. During her senior year, she began recording songs using a friend's equipment and uploading them to SoundCloud, marking her shift from choral training to pursuing a career as an independent rapper. She released her first EP, *Coven Music Session, Vol. 1*, in 2019, followed by the concept album *Oh the Places You’ll Go* in 2020, which featured the TikTok viral hit “Yucky Blucky Fruitcake” that amassed over 10 million Spotify streams by May 2021.

Doechii's breakthrough accelerated in 2022 when she signed with Top Dawg Entertainment (TDE) and Capitol Records, becoming the first female rapper on TDE's roster, a label home to Kendrick Lamar and SZA. She opened for SZA's 2021 Good Days tour, released the EP *She / Her / Black Bitch* featuring the remix of “Persuasive” with SZA, and scored her first Billboard Hot 100 entry with “What It Is (Block Boy)” featuring Kodak Black. Her genre-blending style, mixing rap, R&B, and playful hip-hop, shone in performances at Coachella 2023 and her BET Awards appearance. In August 2024, she dropped the critically acclaimed mixtape *Alligator Bites Never Heal*, peaking at No. 2 on Billboard's Top Rap Albums chart and spawning hits like “Denial Is a River” and “Nissan Altima.”

The mixtape earned her three 2025 Grammy nominations, including Best New Artist, and she won Best Rap Album, becoming only the third Black woman to do so after Lauryn Hill and Cardi B. Billboard named her 2025 Woman of the Year, cementing her legacy as a versatile, boundary-pushing artist redefining rap and R&B with raw lyricism and viral appeal.
