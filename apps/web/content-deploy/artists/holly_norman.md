## Biography
Holly Norman is a versatile musician from East Tennessee, born October 21 in Powell, Tennessee, near Knoxville. She comes from a deeply musical family with strong roots in country and bluegrass traditions—her grandfather, Bill Norman, played fiddle with Roy Acuff and was offered the opportunity to join Acuff's band in Nashville, a path he declined to raise his family. Though she grew up surrounded by music, Norman didn't begin singing until age 19, after initially pursuing performance through twirling as the featured majorette for Powell High School's marching band and later as a featured twirler for the University of Tennessee's Pride of the Southland Band. Her early musical training was rooted in classical percussion, which she studied through high school and university before transitioning to drums in her mid-twenties.

Norman's professional music career has taken multiple directions across different genres and continents. She began singing in her uncle's regional bluegrass band during high school and later secured a multi-year performing position at Dollywood in Pigeon Forge as one of the youngest cast members in a new show. Her debut album, *Appalachian Angel*, showcases seven original songs alongside covers, featuring contemporary bluegrass arrangements with clear country influences, particularly evident in her songwriting style reminiscent of Dolly Parton. Her second album, *Taking Care Of Bluegrass*, is a tribute to Elvis Presley featuring a dozen of his songs plus one original composition, with special guest appearances from Elvis's legendary guitarist James Burton and his backing quartet, Terry Blackwood & The Imperials.

Beyond her bluegrass and country work, Norman has established herself as an accomplished jazz drummer and percussionist with ten years of professional experience across classical, jazz, and commercial music industries. She is a graduate of the WA Academy of Performing Arts and the University of Miami, and has performed with prestigious ensembles including the West Australian Symphony Orchestra, The Cat Empire, Australian String Quartet, and The Panics. Currently based in Melbourne, Australia, she offers private tuition in drum set, hand percussion, and ear training while continuing to perform as a singer-songwriter and compose original music with jazz influences.

## Fun Facts
- Norman was a late starter on drums, not beginning until her mid-twenties after years as a classical percussionist. She was initially reluctant to even call herself a drummer due to the different skill set required compared to orchestral percussion.
- As a high school majorette, Norman performed as the head twirler for Powell High School's marching band and even twirled two fire batons on the field during football games.
- Norman's family has deep connections to country music royalty: her grandfather, Bill Norman, was offered the opportunity to join Roy Acuff's band in Nashville but declined to stay in Tennessee and raise his family—a decision Norman feels she is now fulfilling by continuing the musical legacy her grandfather left behind.
- Though born and raised in East Tennessee, Norman has become an internationally performing musician, having performed at music festivals throughout the United States and Europe, and is currently based in Melbourne, Australia, where she teaches private music lessons.
