## Biography
The New York Ska-Jazz Ensemble (NYSJE) formed in 1994 in New York City during a European tour with The Toasters, conceived by bandleader Fred 'Rocksteady Freddie' Reiter and Rick Faulkner as a 'dream band' blending classic Jamaican instrumental ska with modern jazz improvisation. Drawing members from prominent New York ska acts like The Toasters, The Scofflaws, and The Skatalites—including guitarist Devon James—the group aimed to update traditional ska beats for the 1990s with precision and energy. Their debut performance was a high-profile gig opening for The Skatalites at Skarmageddon '94 in Manhattan Center before over 1,000 fans, marking the start of their rise amid the thriving third-wave ska scene.[1][2][3][5]

Over the next decades, NYSJE released multiple albums starting with their self-titled debut in 1995 on Moon Records, evolving their sound through jazz standards infused with Jamaican rhythms, original compositions, and covers. Led consistently by Reiter on saxophone and flute, the lineup shifted over time—Rick Faulkner and others departed, but the core ska-jazz style remained intact—while they toured extensively across Europe, North America, South America, and beyond, becoming a reference point for the genre. Their music earned features in magazines like Downbeat and Jazziz, TV placements on MTV and Nickelodeon, and a reputation for high-energy live shows that packed venues.[2][3][4][6]

NYSJE's legacy endures as pioneers of 'ska-jazz,' a term coined by Reiter in 1994, influencing the fusion of ska and jazz improvisation within third-wave ska. With over 30 years active, thousands of concerts, and digital re-releases commemorating their catalog, they represent New York's enduring contribution to ska's evolution, maintaining a tight, musician-focused ensemble that prioritizes live performance and genre innovation.[5][6][8]
