## Biography
Robert Walter, a San Diego native, entered the local music scene in high school around 1984, initially playing drums in the funk-rock band Daddy Long Leggs before switching to keyboards under the pseudonym 'Stretch' in the early '90s rock band Creedle, which released three albums and several singles. In 1993, he co-founded The Greyboy Allstars as the backing band for DJ Greyboy, performing weekly at venues like San Diego's Green Circle and San Francisco's Elbo Room, leading to critically acclaimed albums and world tours that launched solo careers for its members. To explore compositions outside Greyboy's style, Walter formed Robert Walter's 20th Congress in 1999, featuring himself on electric piano and Hammond B3 organ, alongside Cochemea Gastelum on sax and flute, Chris Stillwell on bass, and Stanton Moore on drums; their debut *Money Shot* was released in 2000 on Fog City Records.[1][2]

Walter relocated from San Diego to New Orleans in 2003, recording projects like *Super Heavy Organ* with local musicians Johnny Vidacovich, James Singleton, Tim Green, and Stanton Moore, followed by *Cure All* in 2008, blending soul-jazz intellect with funk. After moving to Los Angeles, he revived 20th Congress for the 2013 album *Get Thy Bearings*, spotlighting his organ, piano, Rhodes, and synthesizer work with Elgin Park on guitar/bass, Aaron Redfield on drums, Karl Denson and Cochemea Gastelum on sax, and Chuck Prada on percussion. His style fuses **jam band**, **jazz funk**, soul jazz, funk, and soul elements, drawing from 1970s jazz/funk while remaining instrumental and composer-driven. Walter balances 20th Congress with Greyboy Allstars reunions, film soundtracks, and high-profile tours.[2][3][4]

Currently based in Los Angeles, Walter has toured extensively with Roger Waters on the 'This Is Not A Drill' tour (2022-2023) and Dark Side of the Moon Redux performances, playing Hammond B3, ARP Solina, Clavinet, piano, and melodica. His legacy includes elevating groove-oriented instrumental music, fostering collaborations across jazz, funk, and rock scenes, and maintaining a prolific output through diverse band lineups and quick, in-the-room recording approaches.[1][2][7]
