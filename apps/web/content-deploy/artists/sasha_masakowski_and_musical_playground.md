## Biography
Sasha Masakowski, born in 1986 in New Orleans, Louisiana, grew up immersed in music as the daughter of renowned jazz guitarist Steve Masakowski and classical pianist Ulrike Antonie Sprenger. Exposed to jazz from an early age through her father's associations, including with Ellis Marsalis Jr., she began singing young and pursued formal training at the New Orleans Center for Creative Arts (NOCCA), earning a certificate in Musical Theatre, followed by studies at the University of New Orleans Jazz Studies department—led by her father—and a full scholarship at the Rotterdam Conservatory in the Netherlands focusing on jazz.[5][1][2][3] Her early career featured performances in musical theatre and avant-garde groups like Free Jazz, Brah!, establishing her as a daring improviser blending jazz sub-genres.[3]

Masakowski's style is playful, charismatic, and spontaneous, drawing from jazz, electronic music, rock, and influences like Bobby McFerrin, Rachelle Ferrell, and Flora Purim, often in fully improvised settings.[2][5][4] She leads bands such as Musical Playground (contemporary jazz and world music), Art Market (modern jazz), Tra$h Magnolia (electronic art-rock), and performs with Nova Nola (Brazilian jazz with family), Cliff Hines Quintet, and Sidewalk Strutters (traditional jazz).[1][2][4] Her discography includes debut EP Wishes (2011, produced by James Westfall), Art Market (2018, Ropeadope), and collaborations like Quarantined with Nick (2020) with Nicholas Payton; she has performed globally at venues like Blue Note NYC, Jazz at Lincoln Center Shanghai, and New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival.[2][5][1]

Splitting time between New Orleans and Brooklyn, NY, Masakowski has earned international acclaim as a vocalist, composer, and producer, including a 2018 Artist-in-Residence in Denmark, producing Rasmee's Thong Lor Cowboy (2021, #1 hit in Thailand), and nominations like Offbeat Magazine's Best Female Vocalist (2019). Her work with Musical Playground and family bands positions the Masakowskis as a rising musical dynasty in New Orleans.[2][1]
