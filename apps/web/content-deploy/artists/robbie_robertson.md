## Biography
Jaime Royal 'Robbie' Robertson, born on July 5, 1943, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, to a Mohawk and Cayuga mother from the Six Nations Reserve and a Jewish father, spent much of his early childhood immersed in Indigenous musical traditions during visits to relatives near Brantford, Ontario. There, he was captivated by the sounds of Iroquois water drums, violins, and guitars played by family and elders, igniting his passion for music amid advice to navigate racism as a Native person in urban life. Starting guitar at age 10, he joined his first band at 13, opened for rockabilly star Ronnie Hawkins at 15, and by 16 lied about his intentions to cross into the U.S. to join Hawkins' backing band, the Hawks, initially as bassist then guitarist.[1][2][3][5]

Robertson's career skyrocketed when the Hawks evolved into Bob Dylan's backing band for his controversial 1965-1966 electric tours, then relaunched as The Band in 1967, relocating to Woodstock, New York. As lead guitarist and primary songwriter, he penned classics like 'The Weight,' 'The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down,' and 'Up on Cripple Creek,' blending rock, folk, blues, country, and his Mohawk heritage into what became foundational Americana. The Band's golden era (1967-1973) included landmark albums like *Music from Big Pink* (1968) and *The Basement Tapes* (1975 with Dylan), recorded at their Shangri-La studio in Malibu, though internal tensions led to Robertson's departure in 1976 after *The Last Waltz*.[1][3]

In his solo career, Robertson explored his Native roots deeply, forming the Red Road Ensemble for *Music for the Native Americans* (1994), a soundtrack blending traditional elements with modern production, and *Contact from the Underworld of Redboy* (1998), fusing rock, electronic, and Indigenous themes like Peyote healing, earning a Juno Award. He also scored films with Martin Scorsese and released further solo albums until his death on August 9, 2023, leaving a legacy as a bridge between Indigenous traditions and rock mythology.[1][2][4]

## Fun Facts
- At 16, Robertson lied to U.S. border guards, claiming he was visiting a fictional brother in Arkansas to join Ronnie Hawkins' band without admitting he sought employment.[3]
- His uncles and elders at Six Nations advised: 'Be proud you are an Indian, but be careful who you tell,' reflecting anticipated urban racism he carried through his career.[2]
- On *Music for the Native Americans* (1994), he recorded activist Leonard Peltier speaking from prison over the track 'Sacrifice' about the Pine Ridge incident.[2]
- Robertson was an only child, despite lying about a brother at the border.[3]
