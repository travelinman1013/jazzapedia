## Biography
Stan Getz and João Gilberto represent a pivotal collaboration in music history, though they are distinct artists rather than a unified duo. João Gilberto (born June 10, 1931) is a legendary Brazilian guitarist, vocalist, and composer who revolutionized Brazilian popular music in the 1950s by creating the bossa nova sound. Influenced by both Brazilian samba and swing jazz, Gilberto developed a distinctive minimalist style characterized by quiet, intimate vocals without vibrato and mesmerizing guitar rhythms that perfectly complemented his vocal phrasing. His landmark 1958 recording of "Chega de Saudade" with composer Antônio Carlos Jobim is universally acknowledged as the song that launched both the bossa nova movement and Gilberto's international career. Stan Getz, an American tenor saxophonist, became bossa nova's American ambassador after returning to the United States in 1961 and recording the million-selling album "Jazz Samba" with guitarist Charlie Byrd. Their historic collaboration occurred when Getz attended a Carnegie Hall concert of Brazilian music featuring Gilberto and Jobim in November 1962, after which he proposed a project combining authentic Brazilian bossa nova with his saxophone artistry. The resulting album, Getz/Gilberto, recorded over twenty-four hours on March 18-19, 1963, and released in March 1964, became one of the best-selling jazz albums of all time and is credited with popularizing bossa nova worldwide. The album's success was fueled by the unexpected English-language version of "Garota de Ipanema" ("The Girl from Ipanema") featuring Astrud Gilberto's vocals, which became a global pop phenomenon and transformed both Getz and the Brazilian musicians into international stars.

## Fun Facts
- The English version of "The Girl from Ipanema" came about unexpectedly when João Gilberto, unable to sing in English, turned to his wife Astrud during the recording session. According to one account, Stan Getz (or producer Creed Taylor) heard them singing quietly in the studio corner during a break and invited her to record two tracks in English, though Astrud herself credits the idea entirely to João.
- The Getz/Gilberto recording session was not smooth, with both João Gilberto and Stan Getz holding strong opinions about how the music should be played, requiring them to defer to the producer to resolve disagreements.
- Miles Davis paid João Gilberto a remarkable compliment, saying "He could read a newspaper and sound good," highlighting Gilberto's extraordinary ability to make any material sound musical through his distinctive vocal style.
- The Getz/Gilberto album entered the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1999, and "The Girl from Ipanema" single was inducted a year later, cementing its status as one of the most significant recordings in jazz history.
