## Biography
Lisa Velez, known professionally as Lisa Lisa (born January 15, 1966), is of Puerto Rican descent and grew up in New York City, attending Julia Richman High School in Manhattan. At age 13, she sneaked into nightclubs where she met Mike Hughes of Cult Jam, who introduced her to the production team Full Force—consisting of brothers Lou George (Bowlegged Lou), Paul Anthony George, B-Fine George, Curt-T-T Bedeau, Baby Gee Charles, and Shy Shy Clark. Impressed by her angelic voice during an audition where she sang an a cappella version of Sheena Easton's 'For Your Eyes Only,' Full Force assembled Lisa Lisa & Cult Jam, pairing Velez with guitarist/bassist Alex 'Spanador' Moseley and drummer/keyboardist Mike Hughes, launching one of the first freestyle music groups from New York in the 1980s.[1][2][5]

The group's debut album, *Lisa Lisa & Cult Jam with Full Force* (1985, Columbia Records), exploded with hits like 'I Wonder If I Take You Home,' 'Can You Feel the Beat,' and the gold-certified ballad 'All Cried Out' (featuring Full Force's Paul Anthony and Bowlegged Lou), which peaked at #3 R&B and #8 Pop. The album went platinum, blending freestyle, new jack swing, urban contemporary, and Latin influences to pioneer freestyle into the mainstream. Follow-ups included *Spanish Fly* (1987, double platinum with hits like 'Head to Toe' and 'Lost in Emotion'), *Straight to the Sky* (1989, featuring 'Little Jackie Wants to Be a Star'), and *Straight Outta Hell's Kitchen* (1991, with the #1 R&B/dance hit 'Let the Beat Hit 'Em' produced by Clivillés & Cole). The group disbanded in 1991, after which Velez pursued solo and acting careers, while Moseley and Hughes moved to other projects.[2][3][6]

Lisa Lisa & Cult Jam's legacy lies in popularizing freestyle—a genre mixing hip-hop beats, synths, and Latin rhythms—and influencing 1980s/1990s dance music. Their platinum albums and chart-toppers bridged underground club scenes to pop success, with songs like 'All Cried Out' later covered by Allure (1997). They remain icons of New York freestyle, with enduring popularity (Spotify: 41).[1][2]

## Fun Facts
- At her Full Force audition, Lisa initially sang original songs by Mike Hughes that sounded 'horrible,' making her seem off; she nailed it with an a cappella 'For Your Eyes Only' by Sheena Easton.[5]
- Full Force insisted on a 'Spanish girl' vocalist to fill a market void for Latino representation in pop, leading to Lisa's selection.[5]
- In videos, Cult Jam members lip-synced background vocals performed entirely by Full Force.[5]
- The group recorded 'Go For Yours' exclusively for the *Caddyshack II* soundtrack between albums.[2]
