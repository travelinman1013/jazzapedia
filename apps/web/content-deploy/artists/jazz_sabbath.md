## Biography
Jazz Sabbath is a fictional English jazz trio created in 2020 by Adam Wakeman, a touring keyboardist and guitarist known for his work with Black Sabbath (2004–2017) and Ozzy Osbourne. The band's elaborate backstory claims it originated in the late 1960s UK jazz scene, led by pianist Milton Keanes (a character portrayed by Wakeman). According to the lore, Jazz Sabbath recorded two albums in 1969, but the second was abandoned due to legal disputes, and the first was shelved after Keanes suffered a heart attack and hospitalization. Upon his release in September 1970, Keanes discovered that Black Sabbath from Birmingham had allegedly stolen and metalized their songs, with all evidence destroyed in a warehouse fire tied to label fraud.[1][2][3][4]

The project began in 2013 when Wakeman improvised jazz versions of Black Sabbath songs at a hotel bar piano, later developing the Milton Keanes character and backstory. A mockumentary released on YouTube in February 2020 introduced the band, coinciding with the 50th anniversary of Black Sabbath's debut album. This led to the release of their actual debut album on April 10, 2020, featuring jazz renditions of Black Sabbath classics, followed by Vol. 2 in 2022 and 1968 Tapes in November 2024. Both initial albums charted on the Billboard Jazz Chart, with mono Record Store Day editions, and the band has toured worldwide presenting their 'original' compositions.[3][4][5]

Jazz Sabbath's musical style blends sophisticated jazz improvisation—drawing from the late '60s UK underground scene—with Black Sabbath's heavy riffs, reimagined through piano, bass, drums, and guests. Though satirical, it has earned praise from rock and jazz critics for its musicianship, sparking debate among fans while highlighting Wakeman's versatility. The project's legacy lies in its humorous 'exposure' of Black Sabbath as plagiarists in fiction, reviving interest in jazz-metal crossovers.[1][6][7]
