## Biography
J-Dawg, born Larry Wayne Jones, Jr., is a rapper originally from Garden City, Texas, though strongly associated with the Houston and New Orleans hip-hop scenes. He emerged in the early 2000s, starting with Swishahouse before joining the Boss Hogg Outlaws, a Houston-based collective founded by Slim Thug that included artists like Young Von and C. Ward. Throughout the 2000s and early 2010s, he contributed to group albums and featured on tracks by Southern rap legends such as Chamillionaire and Pimp C, building his reputation as a reliable supporting player in the southern hip-hop landscape.[1][6]

In 2008, J-Dawg released his debut solo mixtape, Behind Tint, Vol. 1, marking his transition to a more independent career. He continued with projects like 2015's Connected and Respected, Vol. 1 and a 2016 collaborative album with Underboss, Dark Days Bright Nights, maintaining a steady output over decades. Some sources link him to New Orleans' Hollygrove neighborhood and early 1990s involvement with Big Boy Records, including membership in the group Black Menace alongside Threat and DJ Jaz, as well as solo releases like The Dawg House and Smokin’ & Rollin’ in 1997, suggesting possible regional ties or multiple artists sharing the name.[2][5]

His musical style draws from southern hip-hop, New Orleans bounce influences per Spotify data, and early inspirations from New York rappers like Dana Dane for storytelling and lyricism, evolving into fast-paced flows developed in New Orleans studios. J-Dawg's career reflects resilience amid personal challenges like jail time, with a passion for creating from nothing that sustained his presence in the underground scene.[1][2]
