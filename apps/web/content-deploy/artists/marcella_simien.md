## Biography
Marcella Rene Simien, daughter of two-time GRAMMY-winning Zydeco artist Terrance Simien, was born into one of the first Creole families to settle St. Landry Parish in Southern Louisiana, surrounded by traditional Creole and Zydeco music from infancy. Practically born onstage, she performed with her father's band from a young age, contributing to recordings like *Creole for Kidz and the History of Zydeco* at age 12, and sang lead vocals on a track from his 2014 GRAMMY-winning album *Dockside Sessions* for Best Regional Roots Album. In 2009, she moved to Memphis to attend the prestigious Memphis College of Art, where she honed her artistic identity and decided to forge her own path blending her Creole heritage with Memphis soul and New Orleans funk, rather than directly following her father's Zydeco style.[1][2][3][4][5][6]

In 2013, Simien founded and became bandleader of Marcella & Her Lovers, assembling top Memphis musicians to create her signature 'swamp soul' sound—a hybrid of classic Memphis soul, New Orleans funk, and Creole accordion elements. Her powerful, soulful voice and lyrics exploring love, loss, and healing earned acclaim, including features on Beale Street Caravan in 2016, Memphis Flyer's '20 Under 30,' and performances on the Legendary Rhythm & Blues Cruise with artists like Marcia Ball and Irma Thomas. Her debut full-length album *Got You Found* (2017), co-produced by Pete Matthews and Toby Vest at American Recording Studio, received critical praise, followed by *Live From Memphis* (2021), capturing a Halloween 2020 performance. She also performs with Marcella & Les Vagues, Magnolias, and her father's Zydeco Experience, with debuts at Joe's Pub in NYC and London as a duo with Mark Black.[1][2][3][4][5][6]

Lauded by producer Boo Mitchell as one of the most soulful artists since Memphis soul's glory days, Simien continues to reinvent boundaries while honoring tradition. She signed with Yonas Media in 2020 and was working on her solo debut as of recent updates, maintaining an active presence with her ensemble's charismatic live shows and multi-instrumental talents including Creole accordion.[1][2][4]
