## Biography
Jack Wilson, an American jazz pianist and composer, was born on August 3, 1936, in Chicago, Illinois, and moved to Fort Wayne, Indiana, at age seven. He began studying piano with Carl Atkinson at the Fort Wayne College of Music from 1949 to 1954, where he was introduced to George Shearing's music, sparking his passion for jazz. By age 15, he became the youngest member of the Fort Wayne Musicians Union (Local 58), led local combos, played tenor saxophone in his high school band, and at 17 substituted in James Moody's band. After brief stints in Columbus, Ohio, and Atlantic City leading the Cotton Club house band, he worked with Dinah Washington in 1957-1958 and returned to Chicago for gigs with Gene Ammons, Sonny Stitt, Eddie Harris, and Al Hibbler, making his recording debut on Richard Evans' *Richard's Almanac* (1959). Drafted into the Army, he served as the first Black music director for the Third Army Area before an honorable medical discharge in 1961 due to diabetes.[1][2][3]

Encouraged by Buddy Collette, Wilson relocated to Los Angeles in 1962, freelancing extensively with Gerald Wilson, Lou Donaldson, Herbie Mann, Jackie McLean, Johnny Griffin, and vocalists like Sarah Vaughan, Sammy Davis Jr., Lou Rawls, Eartha Kitt, Julie London, and Sonny & Cher. His style blended hard bop, bebop, and soul jazz, showcased in his 1963 debut as leader *The Jack Wilson Quartet Featuring Roy Ayers* (Atlantic), followed by albums on Vault and Blue Note, including *Easterly Winds* (1967). He innovated with dual acoustic and electric pianos on later Discovery releases like *Innovations* (1977). In 1985, he moved to New York with Barry Harris's help, performing in duo and continuing sideman work with Esther Phillips, Lorez Alexandria, Eddie Harris, and his final session *In New York* (1993) with Jimmy Cobb.[1][2][3][7]

Wilson's legacy endures as an underappreciated hard bop master, known for his warm, uncluttered piano approach and versatility across studio, big band, and accompaniment roles. Despite critical acclaim for Blue Note albums, commercial success was modest, leading him to focus on live and session work in Los Angeles until his death on October 5, 2007, from natural causes at age 71.[1][3][8]
