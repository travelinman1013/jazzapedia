## Biography
Gladys Alberta Bentley (August 12, 1907 – January 18, 1960) was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to a working-class family with an African American father and Trinidadian mother. At age 16 in 1925, she moved to Harlem, New York, seeking opportunities in the vibrant nightlife scene. She began her career playing piano and singing at rent parties and underground establishments, quickly gaining notice for her deep, growly voice and boyish attire. Her big break came at Harry Hansberry’s Clam House, a notorious gay speakeasy on 133rd Street in 'Jungle Alley,' where she performed in a tuxedo and top hat, singing raunchy, improvised lyrics to popular tunes while flirting with women in the audience.[1][2][3][4][5]
