## Biography
Preservation Brass & the Preservation Hall Jazz Band appears to refer to the **Preservation Hall Jazz Band**, a legendary New Orleans ensemble founded in 1961 at Preservation Hall in the French Quarter. The venue began as an art gallery run by Larry Borenstein in the 1950s, where he hosted local jazz musicians like George Lewis, Sweet Emma Barrett, and Kid Thomas Valentine to attract visitors. In 1961, art enthusiasts Allan and Sandra Jaffe, visiting from Pennsylvania after their honeymoon, were captivated by the traditional New Orleans jazz performances and took over management, renaming it Preservation Hall to preserve the music of aging pioneers who had invented or learned jazz directly from its creators[2][4][5].

Allan Jaffe, a tuba player with a Wharton business background, assembled the band from elderly local musicians facing poverty and racism, emphasizing authenticity with no alcohol, amplification, or advertising. In 1963, he launched international tours starting in the Midwest, taking the band to Japan, Thailand, the Fillmore West with the Grateful Dead, and beyond, while releasing early albums like 'Sweet Emma and the Preservation Hall Jazz Band' (1964). Leadership passed through figures like the Humphrey brothers (Percy on trumpet, Willie on clarinet) in the 1970s-80s, with members including Cie Frazier (drums), Narvin Kimball (banjo), and Jim Robinson (trombone). After Allan's death in 1987, Sandra and son Benjamin Jaffe continued, with Benjamin playing tuba and leading since 1995, integrating younger apprentices like Wendell Brunious and surviving challenges like Hurricane Katrina[1][2][3][4].

The band's musical style is rooted in **traditional New Orleans jazz**, blending brass band, swing, ragtime, and Cajun elements, performed with rollicking energy. Their legacy endures through global tours, recordings, collaborations with modern artists, the Preservation Hall Music Outreach Program post-Katrina, and the 2006 National Medal of Arts, embodying the unbreakable spirit of New Orleans[2][4][5].
