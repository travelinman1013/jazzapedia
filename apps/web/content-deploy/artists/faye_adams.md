## Biography
Faye Adams, born Fanny Tuell on May 22, 1923, began singing religious music at age 5 in church, where her parents would stand her on tables to perform. She started her professional career as a religious singer on a Newark, New Jersey radio show before transitioning to secular music. Under her married name Faye Scruggs, she became a regular in New York nightclubs in the late 1940s and early 1950s. While performing in Atlanta, she was discovered by Ruth Brown, leading to an audition with bandleader Joe Morris, who changed her name to Faye Adams and signed her to Herald Records in 1952.[1][2][3][4][5]

Adams achieved massive success with her debut single 'Shake a Hand' in 1953, which topped the Billboard R&B chart for ten weeks, reached number 22 on the pop chart, and sold one million copies, earning a gold disc. She followed with two more R&B number ones: 'I'll Be True' in 1954 (later covered by Bill Haley and Jackie DeShannon) and 'It Hurts Me to My Heart.' Known as 'Atomic Adams' after leaving Morris's band, she appeared in the 1955 film *Rhythm & Blues Revue*, toured on Rhythm and Blues Show Tours with acts like The Drifters, The Counts, and The Spaniels, and was dubbed 'the little gal with the big voice' by Alan Freed. Her style blended gospel's expressive power with R&B, pioneering early soul elements. She moved to Imperial Records in 1957, but success waned, leading to recordings on small labels until the early 1960s.[1][2][3]

By 1963, Adams retired from secular music, remarried in 1968 as Fannie Jones, and returned to gospel roots and family life in New Jersey. In the 1970s, she co-wrote songs with her husband Clarence E. Jones and released 'Sinner Man' on Savoy Records. She received a Rhythm and Blues Foundation award in 1998 and possibly died on November 2, 2016, though unconfirmed.[1][2][3]
