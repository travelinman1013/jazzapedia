## Biography
Los Rebujitos is a flamenco pop duo from Tarifa, Cádiz, Spain, formed by Manuel González Vera and Yeray Blanco García (also known as Yerai). They launched their career in 2004 by winning a local radio talent show called Cazatalentos with their demo 'Esa Chiquilla,' which paved the way for their debut album 'Lo Que Me Gusta De Ti.' The album sold over 40,000 copies and led to more than 70 concerts across Spain, followed by a special edition with extra tracks and a DVD[1][2][3].

Their second album, 'Tú de qué vas' (2005), showcased a more mature sound with pop influences while retaining flamenco roots. In 2007, 'A Nuestra Bola' featured original songs like 'Recordándote' and 'Y Volverás,' covers of artists such as José El Francés and Los Chichos, and a collaboration with Zinkiyos on 'Volar,' amassing over 5 million YouTube views. Subsequent releases included 'Mas Claro, Agua' (2008) with producer Marko Katier and a track with La Húngara, and 'El Niño Pena' (2010), where they composed seven tracks, highlighting their evolution in flamenco pop, flamenco urbano, and pop styles[1][4].

The duo has built a strong live presence, performing in cities like Madrid, Barcelona, and Sevilla, and festivals across Spain. Their music blends catchy pop melodies with traditional flamenco rhythms, earning a large following and YouTube channel with over 450,000 subscribers. Recent works like the 2022 album 'Marniatico' continue their dynamic fusion, solidifying their legacy in Spanish Latin pop and flamenco scenes[2][4].
