## Biography
José Ribamar Coelho Santos, known by his stage name Zeca Baleiro, was born on April 11, 1966, in São Luís, Maranhão, in northeastern Brazil. Growing up immersed in music from a young age, he earned the nickname 'Baleiro' (candyman) during his university studies in Agronomy due to his fondness for sweets. Initially pursuing agronomy, Baleiro transitioned into music, debuting with the album *Por Onde Andará Stephen Fry?* in 1997, which achieved gold status and referenced British actor Stephen Fry's infamous stage disappearance.[1]

Baleiro's career flourished with subsequent releases like *Vô Imbolá* (1999), also gold-certified, establishing him as a prominent figure in MPB (Música Popular Brasileira), alongside genres such as new MPB, Brazilian pop, rock, and samba. His song 'Salão de Beleza' gained international recognition on Putumayo World Music's *Reggae Around the World* compilation. He has collaborated with artists like guitarist Pedro Joia and released numerous albums, including live recordings and duets. Baleiro won a Latin Grammy in 2000 for Best Pop Album and received multiple nominations, including for *Calma Aí, Coração - Ao Vivo* (2014), *O Amor no Caos* (2019), *Canções d'Além Mar* (2021), and his 2024 collaboration *Ao Arrepio da Lei* with Chico César, praised by the São Paulo Art Critics Association.[1]

Known for his experimental and unpredictable style, Baleiro blends diverse influences while maintaining MPB roots, often exploring social themes with poetic lyrics. Now residing in São Paulo, his legacy includes over two decades of innovative output, Grammy recognition, and contributions as a songwriter, guitarist, and columnist.[1]
