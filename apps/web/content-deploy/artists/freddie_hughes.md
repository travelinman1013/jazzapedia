## Biography
Freddie Hughes, born Frederick W. Hughes Jr. on August 20, 1943, in Berkeley, California, grew up in the segregated Harbor Homes housing projects in Oakland after his parents migrated from Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas. He discovered his voice singing in the church choir, laying the foundation for his gospel-influenced soul style. A graduate of Castlemont High School in Oakland, Hughes emerged in the Bay Area music scene during the 1960s, becoming a veteran soul and R&B singer known for his powerful vocals on hit records from that era[2][3][4][5][6].

Hughes launched his recording career in the mid-1960s, achieving breakthrough success with his 1968 single 'Send My Baby Back,' which became a northern soul classic. He recorded for various labels, delivering soulful R&B tracks that resonated in the Bay Area and beyond, blending gospel roots with secular soul. Over six decades, he remained active in the record business, reflecting on his enduring contributions to the genre despite challenges in the competitive industry[2][3][6].

Hughes passed away on January 18, 2022, leaving a legacy as a Bay Area soul legend whose music continues to influence northern soul enthusiasts. His work exemplifies the raw emotion and spiritual depth of West Coast soul, with tracks cherished in revival scenes[2][4].
