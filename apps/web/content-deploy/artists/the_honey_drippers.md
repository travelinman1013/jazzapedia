## Biography
The Honeydrippers were an English rock and roll supergroup formed in 1981 in Worcestershire, England, by former Led Zeppelin vocalist Robert Plant to pursue his passion for rhythm and blues-infused rock music. Plant assembled an initial lineup featuring local musicians including guitarists Andy Silvester and Robbie Blunt, drummer Kevin O'Neill, harmonica player Ricky Cool, bassists Jim Hickman and Wayne Terry, and saxophonist Keith Evans. The band's name was inspired by American blues singer Roosevelt Sykes, known as 'Honeydripper.' Their musical style blended vintage rock & roll, roots rock, and heavy R&B influences, drawing from early rock pioneers like Little Richard and Elvis Presley, which contrasted with Plant's more experimental post-Zeppelin solo work.[1][3][5]

In 1984, the project evolved into a high-profile supergroup for their sole release, the EP *The Honeydrippers: Volume One*, released on November 12, 1984. This featured guest appearances from guitar legends Jimmy Page (Plant's Led Zeppelin bandmate), Jeff Beck (former Yardbirds guitarist), Brian Setzer (Stray Cats), and Nile Rodgers, with support from musicians like Paul Shaffer on keyboards and drummers Keith 'Bev' Smith and Dave Weckl. The EP achieved commercial success, peaking at #3 on the Billboard Hot 100 with a cover of Phil Phillips' 'Sea of Love' and #25 with 'Rockin' at Midnight' (a rewrite of Roy Brown's tune). They performed on *Saturday Night Live* on December 15, 1984. Despite plans for a full album, the band disbanded after 1985, though Plant revived the name for a 2006 charity show and briefly considered a reunion with Ahmet Ertegun in 2007.[1][3][4][5]

The Honeydrippers' brief legacy lies in their celebration of retro rock & roll and R&B, showcasing Plant's rootsy side amid his solo career. Active primarily 1981-1985 (with later one-offs until 2006), they remain a footnote in rock history for uniting iconic guitarists on covers that highlighted Plant's vocal prowess and love for 1950s-style music.[1][5]
