## Biography
Blue Highway is an American bluegrass band formed in 1994 in Kingsport, Tennessee, initially as a weekend project by guitarist Tim Stafford, who had previously played with Alison Krauss & Union Station. Stafford, raised in eastern Tennessee where bluegrass was a cultural staple, teamed up with bassist Wayne Taylor, a Southwest Virginia coal truck driver and musician, mandolinist/fiddler/vocalist Shawn Lane (formerly with Ricky Skaggs and Doyle Lawson), dobro player Rob Ickes, and banjoist Jason Burleson. The band played its first show on December 31, 1994, at the First Night Celebration in Kingsport and quickly signed with Rebel Records, releasing their debut album *It's a Long, Long Road* in 1995, which topped Bluegrass Unlimited charts and won IBMA Album of the Year and Emerging Artist of the Year awards in 1996.[1][2][3]
