## Biography
Madonna Louise Veronica Ciccone was born on August 16, 1958, as the third of eight children[3]. She lost her mother to breast cancer at age six, an event that profoundly shaped her early life[3]. In 1977, while studying at the University of Michigan, Madonna received a six-week scholarship to study with the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater in New York City, followed by a rare opportunity to perform with choreographer Pearl Lang in 1978[2]. At her dance instructor's urging, she dropped out of college after two years to pursue her dance career in New York, where she supported herself through various odd jobs including nude art modeling and serving at the Russian Tea Room[2].

Madonna's musical career began in the late 1970s when she joined the ska-influenced pop-punk band Breakfast Club as a drummer and later became lead singer[2]. In 1979, she began dating band member Dan Gilroy, who introduced her to opportunities in Paris where she worked as a showgirl and backup dancer for French disco artist Patrick Hernandez[1][2]. Upon returning to the United States in 1980, she reunited with musician Stephen Bray, and together they formed the band Emmy[1]. In 1981, Madonna decided to go solo and hired manager Camille Barbone of Gotham Records, who helped her navigate the male-dominated music industry and assemble a studio band[2]. She was signed by Sire Records in 1982 and released her debut studio album *Madonna* in 1983, which launched her to solo stardom[1][2].

Madonna's rise to pop stardom accelerated dramatically in the 1980s and 1990s. Her second album *Like a Virgin* (1984) became a global phenomenon, with its provocative video capitalizing on MTV's growing influence[3]. By 1991, she had achieved 21 Top 10 hits in the United States and sold more than 70 million albums internationally, generating $1.2 billion in sales[2][4]. She became known for constant reinvention and provocation, leading the Vatican to describe her Blonde Ambition tour as "one of the most satanic shows in the history of humanity"[3]. Beyond music, Madonna ventured into acting, appearing in films including *Shanghai Surprise* (1986), *Dick Tracy* (1990), and directing films such as *W.E.* (2011)[1][2]. In 1992, she founded Maverick Records as a subsidiary of Warner Music Group, demonstrating her commitment to controlling her career and image[2][4]. Her career experienced a resurgence with the critically acclaimed album *Ray of Light* (1998), which earned her first musical Grammy Awards[4]. Madonna continued releasing successful albums throughout the 2000s and 2010s, including *Confessions on a Dance Floor* (2005), *MDNA* (2012), *Rebel Heart* (2015), and *Madame X* (2019)[1][4]. In January 2008, *Forbes* magazine named her the world's wealthiest female musician, with income derived from her music career, H&M clothing line, concert tours, and various business ventures[2]. She was inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2004 as one of its five founding members[1].
