## Biography
Tony Joe White was born on July 23, 1943, in Mississippi and raised in Louisiana, where he developed his signature swamp rock style influenced by the Southern blues and country sounds of his environment. Initially performing Elvis Presley and John Lee Hooker covers, he had an epiphany after hearing Bobbie Gentry's 'Ode to Billie Joe,' prompting him to write about his own experiences, leading to his breakthrough hit 'Polk Salad Annie' from the 1969 album Black and White, which peaked at #8 on Billboard's Hot 100 and was covered by Elvis Presley and Tom Jones[3][4][6]. After a period of inactivity in the 1980s, he contributed four songs, guitar, and harmonica to Tina Turner's 1989 album Foreign Affair[2][3][5].

In the 1990s, White experienced a career resurgence with the commercially successful Closer to the Truth (1991) on his Swamp label, followed by The Path of a Decent Groove and Lake Placid Blues, co-produced by Roger Davies[3][4][5]. He toured Europe, including Germany and France, with Eric Clapton and Joe Cocker, and performed at the 1992 Montreux Festival[2][3][5]. His 2006 album Uncovered featured high-profile collaborations with Eric Clapton, Mark Knopfler, J.J. Cale, and others, solidifying his blues rock legacy in genres like swamp rock and blues[1][3][4]. White continued releasing albums like Hoodoo (2013) until his death in 2018[4][6].

Known for his deep, gravelly voice and evocative storytelling of Southern life, White's musical style blended blues, funk country, and boogie, earning him acclaim as the 'King of Funk Country' and enduring influence through covers and samples, such as 'Elements and Things' in the HBO series Luck[3][9].
