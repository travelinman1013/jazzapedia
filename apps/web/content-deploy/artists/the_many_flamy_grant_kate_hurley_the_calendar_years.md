## Biography
The Many, Flamy Grant, Kate Hurley, and The Calendar Years are individual artists who collaborated on the 2023 Advent single 'The Whole World Is Waiting,' blending their distinct styles in a shared project focused on worship and seasonal themes.[1][3] Kate Hurley, raised in a small mountain town in Colorado, discovered her passion for music through an old upright piano, journaling, and family time, which continue to inspire her songwriting and performances.[2] She toured globally from 2002 for 13 years, performing in places like Germany and India, teaching songwriting workshops, and working with refugees and houseless individuals before transitioning to teaching music lessons and pursuing writing and life coaching.[2]

Flamy Grant, a drag queen from western North Carolina (Bible Belt), debuted with the 2022 album 'Bible Belt Baby,' nominated for Best Pop Album at the San Diego Music Awards and recognized as a top queer country album.[4][5] Her music fuses country, gospel, folk, and roots, addressing queer spiritual journeys, religious trauma, and resilience, with influences from Amy Grant; she has earned accolades like the 2023 Kerrville Folk Festival New Folk win and 2025 International Folk Music Awards finalist status.[4] Limited information is available on The Many and The Calendar Years beyond their involvement in the collaboration, suggesting they are niche acts in Christian or worship music circles.[3]

Their joint work exemplifies a collective effort in contemporary worship music, though individual legacies vary: Hurley emphasizes community healing through music and teaching, while Grant challenges norms in spiritual music for LGBTQ+ audiences.[1][2][4]
