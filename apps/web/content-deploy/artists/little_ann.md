## Biography
Ann Bridgeforth, known professionally as Little Ann, was born on March 22, 1945, in Chicago, Illinois, and grew up in Mount Clemens, Michigan, after her family relocated there in the late 1950s. As the youngest of seven siblings, she earned the nickname 'Little Ann' from her family and began performing locally, singing at her cousin's club, Michelle's Playroom, and in church, where she drew inspiration from gospel legend Aretha Franklin. Her raw, emotive soul style emerged in the mid-1960s, characterized by deep, heartfelt vocals that conveyed profound intimacy and longing.[1][2][3]

## Fun Facts
- An acetate of her song 'What Should I Do?' was mislabeled as 'When He's Not Around' by Rose Valentine and became a massive Northern soul hit in the UK during the early 1980s before her true identity was revealed.[1][2][4]
- Little Ann co-wrote all but two songs on her Deep Shadows album, infusing the recordings with deep personal intimacy, as she wrote to her mother, 'If it doesn’t work out, I tried.'[3]
- Her only contemporary single release, 'Going Down a One Way Street,' had its lyrics and arrangements altered against her wishes by Ric-Tic executive Berry Gordy's brother-in-law, preventing further releases at the time.[4]
- She performed live in the UK for the first time in 2002, 35 years after starting her career, receiving adulation just before her death.[1][2][4]
