## Biography
Barrett Strong Jr. was born on February 5, 1941, in West Point, Mississippi, and moved to Detroit at a young age, where he grew up on the city's west side as the son of a Uniroyal Tire plant worker and a housewife. Self-taught on piano, he joined a gospel group with his four sisters called the Strong Singers and met artists like Sam Cooke and Jackie Wilson during tours. Through Wilson, he connected with Berry Gordy in 1957, leading to his signing with Motown's Tamla label in April 1959 at age 18. His early singles included 'Let’s Rock' and 'Do The Very Best You Can,' but limited success followed until July 1959, when he contributed piano and vocals to 'Money (That’s What I Want),' co-written with Gordy and Janie Bradford, which became Motown's first hit, reaching No. 2 on the R&B chart and No. 23 pop, selling a million copies.[1][2][3][4][5]

Strong released follow-ups like 'Yes, No, Maybe So' but left Motown in 1961, recording for labels including Vee-Jay in Chicago. By the late 1960s, he returned to Detroit as a songwriter, forming a prolific partnership with Norman Whitfield that defined Motown's psychedelic soul era. They co-wrote classics such as 'I Heard It Through the Grapevine' (Marvin Gaye, Gladys Knight & the Pips), 'War' (Edwin Starr), 'Cloud Nine' and 'Papa Was a Rollin' Stone' (Temptations, Grammy winner), and 'Just My Imagination (Running Away With Me)' (Temptations). His performing career waned, but he released solo albums like 'Stronghold' in the 1970s on Capitol and Epic before leaving Motown again when it relocated to Los Angeles.[1][2][3][4]

Inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2004 for his pivotal role in Motown's formative years, Strong passed away on January 28, 2023, at age 81. Known for genres like Motown, northern soul, and classic soul, his legacy endures through timeless hits that shaped soul and pop history, with 'Money' famously covered by The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, and others.[2][3][4][5]
