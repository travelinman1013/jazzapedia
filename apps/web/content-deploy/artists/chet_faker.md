## Biography
Nicholas James Murphy, born on 23 June 1988 in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, adopted the stage name Chet Faker as an homage to jazz musician Chet Baker. Influenced by Bob Dylan, his mother's Motown albums, and his father's chilled-out Ibiza CDs, Murphy spent eight years making music privately before gaining public attention. His career breakthrough came in 2011 when his cover of Blackstreet's 'No Diggity' went viral, topping the Hypemachine chart and later featured in a 2013 Super Bowl commercial for Beck's Sapphire.[1][2][4]

Murphy released his debut EP *Thinking in Textures* in 2012, earning Breakthrough Artist of the Year and Best Independent Single/EP at the Australian Independent Records Awards, as well as Best Independent Release at the Rolling Stone Australia Awards. Signing with Downtown Records in the US, he collaborated with artists like Flume on the *Lockjaw* EP, featuring the hit 'Drop the Game'. His debut album *Built on Glass* (2014) debuted at number one on the ARIA Charts, with 'Talk Is Cheap' topping Triple J's Hottest 100 and tracks like 'Gold' gaining international exposure, including an Apple MacBook ad and performances at Coachella and on Ellen.[1][2][3][5]

In 2016, Murphy retired the Chet Faker moniker to perform under his birth name, releasing singles, the *Missing Link* EP (2017), *Run Fast Sleep Naked* (2019), and *Music for Silence* (2020). He later revived Chet Faker with *Hotel Surrender* (2021), expanding his electronica sound with loungey, sultry elements blending subtlety and beauty, and continued activity into the 2020s, including 'A Love for Strangers'.[2][4][5][9]
