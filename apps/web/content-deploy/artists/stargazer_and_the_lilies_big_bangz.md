# Stargazer and the Lilies, Big Bangz

## Biography
The Stargazer Lilies are a shoegaze band formed by husband-and-wife duo Kim Field (vocals and bass) and John Cep (also known as John Ceparano, multi-instrumentalist and guitar), originally from New York before relocating to North East Pennsylvania. They evolved from their previous project, Soundpool, an electronic-influenced group that had shifted too dance-oriented for their tastes, prompting a move toward moodier, louder, guitar-driven shoegaze with psychedelic rock elements in 2013. Their debut album, *We Are the Dreamers* (Graveface Records), established their signature reverb-washed, dreamy soundscapes blending influences like My Bloody Valentine, Slowdive, Pink Floyd, and Cocteau Twins, described by critics as a 'psych-fuzz epic' with cinematic crescendos.[1][2][5][6]

The band's career progressed with releases like *Door to the Sun* (2016), *Lost* (2017), *Occabot* (2019, produced by Tobacco), and *Cosmic Tidal Wave* (2022, their first on self-founded label Floravinyl Records), reflecting evolutions in style—initially hazy and dark, later incorporating sun-drenched, beachy grooves influenced by moves between Pennsylvania woods and Florida subtropics amid personal challenges like John's mother's health issues. Live lineups expanded, notably recruiting drummer Cari Gee (formerly Carissa Giard) and multi-instrumentalist Jake Stuart from Peyote Coyote after meeting at Bumblefest 2016. Their music aims to transport listeners to utopian dimensions, drawing from diverse genres including Paisley Underground, psych rock, bossa nova, French pop, trip hop, 60s soul, and Motown.[3][5][6]

Now Florida-based in the Tampa area, The Stargazer Lilies continue pioneering shoegaze's new wave, praised by figures like Brad Laner of Medicine for embodying the genre's ideals with indelible melodies and effects-heavy guitars. Their sound has been lauded for its widescreen immersion, evolving from stripped-down melancholy to eclectic, groove-oriented psychedelia while maintaining a core of dreamy, transcendent haze.[2][3][5]

## Fun Facts
- The band met drummer Cari Gee and multi-instrumentalist Jake Stuart at Bumblefest 2016, recruiting them after being impressed by their band Peyote Coyote's opening set.[5]
- Their 2022 album Cosmic Tidal Wave was inspired by renting a mid-century modern, all-glass house in Lakeland, Florida, which shifted their sound to a more sun-drenched, beachy vibe amid back-and-forth moves between PA and FL during John's mother's health scares.[3][5]
- John Cep previously handled drums on albums but admitted he 'sucked on the drums,' leading to collaborations with skilled drummers like Carissa Giard for Cosmic Tidal Wave.[5]
- They launched their own label, Floravinyl Records, for Cosmic Tidal Wave after lacking external label commitments, aiming to release music from The Stargazer Lilies and Soundpool.[3]
