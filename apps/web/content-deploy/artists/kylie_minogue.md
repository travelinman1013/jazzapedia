## Biography
Kylie Minogue was born and raised in Melbourne, Australia, where she began acting as a child and rose to fame playing Charlene Robinson on the soap opera Neighbours from 1986 to 1988. Her music career launched in the late 1980s after meeting producers Stock, Aitken and Waterman, who crafted her debut hit 'I Should Be So Lucky' in just 40 minutes; she released four dance-pop albums under PWL, scoring hits like 'The Loco-Motion,' 'Hand on Your Heart,' and 'Better the Devil You Know.' Leaving Neighbours in 1988 to focus on music, Minogue transitioned labels, signing with Deconstruction in 1993 for a more experimental phase with her self-titled 1994 album and Impossible Princess (1997), blending indie and electronic sounds.[1][2][3][4]

In 1999, Minogue signed with Parlophone, revitalizing her career with disco-influenced dance-pop on Light Years (2000), featuring hits 'Spinning Around' and 'On a Night Like This,' followed by the global smash Fever (2001) and its iconic 'Can't Get You Out of My Head.' She won her first Grammy for 'Come into My World' in 2004, faced breast cancer in 2005 (recovering to tour in 2006), and continued with albums like Body Language (2003), X (2007), Aphrodite (2010), Golden (2018) incorporating country, Disco (2020), Tension (2023), and Tension II (2024). Her style evolved from bubblegum pop to sophisticated electro-dance, cementing her as a dance-pop icon.[1][3][4]

Minogue's legacy includes UK number-one singles across four decades and albums topping charts in five consecutive decades, making her the only female artist to achieve this; she earned a second Grammy for 'Padam Padam' in 2024, received Global Icon and Billboard Icon Awards, and performed with Madonna. With Spotify genres in dance pop and popularity of 73, she remains a cultural force in music, acting, and business.[1][4]
