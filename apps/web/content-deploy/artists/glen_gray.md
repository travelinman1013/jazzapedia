## Biography
Glen Gray, born Glenn Gray Knoblauch on June 7, 1900, in Metamora, Illinois, to parents of German and Scottish descent, began playing saxophone in his teens and entered the music scene during the 1920s. He joined various ensembles, including working under Jean Goldkette, before becoming a key figure in the Orange Blossoms band in Detroit by 1929. That year, the band incorporated as a cooperative— the first of its kind where musicians owned stock—changed their name to the Casa Loma Orchestra after their Detroit hotel venue, and elected the tall, charismatic Gray (standing six feet five inches) as leader for his business acumen and stabilizing influence.[1][2][3][6]

Under Gray's leadership, the Casa Loma Orchestra pioneered a polished ensemble jazz style blending hot swing and sweet ballads, predating Benny Goodman's rise and influencing the swing era. They gained fame with college crowds through precise arrangements by Gene Gifford, hits like 'Smoke Rings' (their 1932 theme), and radio exposure on the Camel Caravan starting in 1933. Recording for labels like Okeh, Brunswick, Victor, Decca, and Mercury, the band toured relentlessly but faced decline by the mid-1940s due to personnel changes and shifting tastes; the cooperative dissolved in 1942, though Gray retained the name and continued leading with stars like Bobby Hackett and Herb Ellis until health issues (diabetes and circulation problems) forced a 1947 disbandment.[1][2][3][4][5][6]

In the 1950s, Gray staged a successful comeback, conducting studio orchestras for Capitol Records' 'Casa Loma in Hi-Fi' series (1956), recreating big band hits with former vocalist Kenny Sargent. He retired to Plymouth, Massachusetts, continuing saxophone in spare time, and passed away from cancer on August 23, 1963. His legacy endures as a forerunner of swing, noted for innovative cooperative structure and versatile sound.[2][4][5][6]
