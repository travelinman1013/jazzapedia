## Biography
Roy Milton, born Roy Bunny Milton on July 31, 1907, in Wynnewood, Oklahoma, grew up on a Chickasaw reservation where his grandmother was a Native American; he later moved to Tulsa. Developing a passion for music in a musical family, he joined the Ernie Fields band in the late 1920s as a singer and drummer, honing his skills in jump blues, boogie-woogie, and R&B styles characterized by heavy backbeats, shuffle rhythms, swinging horn sections, and energetic vocals.[1][3][8] In 1933, he relocated to Los Angeles, forming his own band, the Solid Senders, featuring pianist Camille Howard, and began recording in the 1940s, initially on his Miltone label.

Milton's breakthrough came in 1946 with 'R.M. Blues' on Specialty Records, a massive hit that topped West Coast charts and helped establish the label, launching a string of 19 Top Ten R&B hits through the early 1950s including 'Milton's Boogie,' 'Hop, Skip and Jump,' 'Rainy Day,' 'Best Wishes,' 'Confession Blues,' and 'Them There Eyes.' A dynamic showman, witty composer, and driving drummer, he toured extensively with top bands, defining jump blues as a dance-oriented blend of swing, blues, gospel, and boogie-woogie that influenced early rock and roll.[1][2][3]

By the mid-1950s, the rise of rock and roll diminished his chart success, though he continued recording and performing into the 1960s on labels like King, with later works featuring musicians like Roy Gaines and Shuggie Otis. He appeared at the 1970 Monterey Jazz Festival with Johnny Otis' band. Milton passed away on September 18, 1983, in Los Angeles, leaving a legacy as a pioneer whose rhythms shaped R&B, rock, and artists from Elvis Presley to James Brown.[1][2][3]
