## Biography
Reverend Edward W. Clayborn (March 10, 1880 – January 1978), known as the 'Guitar Evangelist,' was an American musician who pioneered blues gospel music. Little is definitively known about his early life, though some researchers suggest he may have originated from Alabama based on recording session associations. He became a minister at St. Luke's Baptist Church in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where he later passed away. Clayborn's career peaked in the late 1920s, recording approximately 20 to 40 songs for Vocalion Records between 1926 and 1930, establishing him as the earliest documented guitar evangelist on record.

Clayborn's musical style featured powerful vocals paired with brilliant slide guitar playing, often in 'Spanish' or Open G tuning, delivering a form of sanctified blues gospel akin to Blind Willie Johnson. His songs, such as the hit 'Your Enemy Cannot Harm You (But Watch Your Close Friends)' and 'The Gospel Train Is Coming,' blended spiritual intensity with blues structures, targeting the 'race records' market alongside vaudeville and jazz. Though his guitar rhythms could feel monotonous across tracks, his lyrical depth and raw delivery influenced subsequent gospel blues artists, bridging secular blues and sacred music.

Clayborn's legacy endures as a foundational figure in guitar evangelist music, with his Vocalion sides reissued on compilations and praised for their vortex-like power. His work helped define the genre, inspiring labels to seek similar artists, and select tracks like 'True Religion' have been noted in literature by Philip K. Dick. Despite sparse personal details and only one known photo, his recordings remain celebrated for their primitive authenticity comparable to Robert Johnson's blues.
