## Biography
Aaron Thibeaux "T-Bone" Walker (May 28, 1910 – March 16, 1975) was born in Linden, Texas, into a musical family where both parents were musicians.[4] His stepfather, Marco Washington, taught him to play multiple instruments including guitar, bass, banjo, ukulele, violin, and mandolin.[4] Walker left school at age 10 and by 15 was performing professionally on the blues circuit in Dallas.[2] A pivotal influence came from family friend Blind Lemon Jefferson, a legendary blues musician who frequently visited their home for dinner.[2] As a boy, Walker served as Jefferson's guide around Deep Ellum, Dallas, absorbing the musician's style and becoming his protégé.[1][2]

Walker began his recording career in 1929 as "Oak Cliff T-Bone," releasing "Wichita Falls Blues" backed with "Trinity River Blues" on Columbia Records.[2] In 1935, he moved to Los Angeles and became the first blues guitarist to play the electric guitar, revolutionizing the instrument's role in blues music.[1] Throughout the late 1930s and 1940s, he performed at prominent venues including the Little Harlem and Club Alabam nightclubs, and toured with Les Hite's Cotton Club orchestra from 1940 to 1945 as a featured vocalist.[1] His most famous composition, "Call It Stormy Monday (But Tuesday Is Just as Bad)," recorded in 1947 for Black & White Records, became a blues standard.[2] Walker's fluid technique combined country blues traditions with contemporary swing, earning him the title "Daddy of the Blues."[1]

In the early 1960s, Walker joined Count Basie's orchestra and began performing before largely white audiences in Europe and at prestigious jazz festivals in Monterey, Nice, and Montreux.[1] His career spanned more than four decades of recording, and his influence extended across generations of musicians. Walker died of a stroke in Los Angeles on March 16, 1975, with more than a thousand mourners attending his funeral at Inglewood Cemetery.[1] His pioneering use of the electric guitar and innovative musical style established him as a foundational figure in modern blues, rock, and jump blues.
