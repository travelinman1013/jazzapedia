## Biography
The Swan Silvertones were an American gospel group founded in 1938 by Claude A. Jeter, a coal miner from Montgomery, Alabama, who formed the ensemble in Coalwood, West Virginia, initially naming it the Four Harmony Kings. The group originally consisted of Jeter and his brother along with two fellow miners, and they quickly gained local recognition performing at weekend gospel gatherings throughout West Virginia, Kentucky, Virginia, and North Carolina. In 1942, the group relocated to Knoxville, Tennessee, where they secured a regular Sunday morning radio slot on WBIR sponsored by Swan Bakery, which led to their name change to the Swan Silvertones. This radio exposure, broadcast across a wide geographic area, established them as one of the premier gospel groups in the South by 1946.

Throughout their career, the Swan Silvertones became renowned for their tight harmonies and sophisticated vocal arrangements, blending close barbershop harmony with virtuoso leads and incorporating styles ranging from a cappella to jazz to various gospel forms. The group's classic lineup featured Claude Jeter as lead tenor, Louis Johnson and Paul Owens as tenors, John H. Myles as baritone, and William "Pete" Connor as bass. They recorded extensively between 1946 and 1967, releasing at least nine albums across multiple labels including King Records (1946-1951), Specialty Records (1951-1953), and Vee-Jay Records (1955-1965). The group was inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2002 and the International Gospel Music Hall of Fame in 2003, cementing their legacy as one of the greatest gospel groups of the twentieth century.

After Jeter's departure in 1967, the Swan Silvertones continued with occasional performances, while Jeter pursued a solo career and eventually concentrated on his religious ministry in New York City. Jeter became known as the "Father of Falsetto" and left an indelible mark on popular music, cited as a vocal and lyrical influence on major artists including Sam Cooke, Al Green, Eddie Kendricks, Curtis Mayfield, and Paul Simon.
