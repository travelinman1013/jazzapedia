## Biography
Red Norvo, born Kenneth Norville on March 31, 1908, in Beardstown, Illinois, began his musical journey early, receiving piano instruction as a child and selling his pet pony to buy his first marimba. He started playing professionally at age 17 in Chicago with his marimba ensemble, the Collegians, later joining Paul Ash's orchestra where he adopted the stage name Red Norvo due to the leader's mispronunciation of his name. Norvo performed as a solo vaudeville act, incorporating tap-dancing, and worked with bands like Paul Whiteman's before releasing his first records as a leader in 1933, showcasing his xylophone prowess on tracks like 'In a Mist' and 'Dance of the Octopus'.[1][2][5][7]

Norvo's career evolved through the swing era, leading small groups at New York's Hickory House and Famous Door in 1934-35, then expanding to a 12-piece orchestra with his wife, vocalist Mildred Bailey, from 1936-40, featuring innovative arrangements by Eddie Sauter that blended subtle swing with forward-looking timbres. He switched permanently to vibraphone around 1944, joining Benny Goodman's sextet and later Woody Herman's band in 1946. In 1949, he formed a landmark trio with guitarist Tal Farlow and bassist Charles Mingus, emphasizing light, speedy unisons and improvisational interplay, which is remembered as one of jazz's finest small groups.[1][2][3][4]

Norvo's later career involved freelance work, extensive touring including Europe with Goodman in 1959 and George Wein's groups, and performances in Las Vegas alongside Frank Sinatra. Despite personal challenges like hearing loss requiring surgery in 1968 and the death of his second wife Eve Rogers in 1972, he returned in 1974 as a solo act, continuing to perform into the 1980s with albums like 'Vibes a la Red' (1974) and 'Swing Reunion' (1985), solidifying his legacy as 'Mr. Swing' and a pioneer of jazz vibraphone.[1][3][6]
