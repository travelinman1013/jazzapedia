## Biography
No comprehensive biographical information could be found for a musical artist specifically named 'Boco' from credible sources. Multiple entities with similar names exist, including a California-based hip-hop duo (Boski Tha Savior and Coco Danja), a French electronic musician blending trap and future bass, and a Berlin Opera Chamber Orchestra (BOCO), but none match the Spotify context (popularity 40, unknown genres) with detailed verified bios covering early life, career, style, or legacy[5][6][2][7].

The search results primarily highlight more prominent artists like Cuco (Omar Banos), whose name phonetically resembles 'Boco' but is distinct; he is an American singer-songwriter from Hawthorne, California, born June 26, 1998, to Mexican immigrant parents, self-taught in music from age eight, and known for blending bossa nova, indie-pop, and psychedelia[1]. If 'Boco' refers to the hip-hop duo or electronic artist, limited details indicate origins in California or France without deeper personal history[5][6].

Without authoritative sources providing the required early life, career development, musical style, or legacy for 'Boco', further research or clarification on the exact artist (e.g., Spotify ID) is recommended.
