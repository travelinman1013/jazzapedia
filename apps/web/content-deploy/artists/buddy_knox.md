## Biography
Buddy Wayne Knox was born on July 20, 1933, on a wheat farm northeast of Happy, Texas, a small farming community known as 'The Town Without A Frown.' Growing up in rural West Texas, he learned to play guitar in his youth and wrote his future hit 'Party Doll' at age 15 in 1948. While attending West Texas State College majoring in psychology, business administration, and later pursuing a master's in accounting, Knox formed a band with fellow students Jimmy Bowen on bass and Don Lanier on lead guitar, later adding Dave Alldred on drums. Initially called the Orchids for their orchid-colored shirts, they became the Rhythm Orchids and played local clubs and dances to fund their education.[1][2][3]

Knox's career breakthrough came after attending Elvis Presley's 1955 Amarillo concert, where Presley encouraged them to record, and meeting Roy Orbison, who recommended Norman Petty's Clovis, New Mexico studio. In 1956, they recorded 'Party Doll' there, which Roulette Records released in 1957, topping the Cash Box chart, selling over a million copies, and earning a gold disc. Follow-up hits included 'I'm Stickin' With You' (No. 14, recorded by Bowen), 'Rock Your Little Baby to Sleep' (No. 17), and 'Hula Love' (No. 9). Knox's light tenor over insistent rhythms defined his rockabilly style—rock and roll with less instrumentation, a term he reportedly coined. He appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show, in the film Disc Jockey Jamboree, and toured with Alan Freed's shows, sharing sessions with Buddy Holly and the Crickets.[1][2][5]

After army service, the Rhythm Orchids disbanded, and Knox moved to Liberty and United Artists, scoring minor hits like 'Lovey-Dovey' and 'Ling Ting Tong' with producer Snuff Garrett. In 1968, he relocated to Nashville, blending rockabilly with country on albums like Gypsy Man with Sonny Curtis. Later, he moved to Vancouver in 1970, starting Sunny Hill label and the Purple Steer nightclub, touring Europe in rockabilly revivals. Knox passed away on February 14, 1999, outliving peers like Holly and Orbison, and was inducted into the Rockabilly Hall of Fame, with 'Party Doll' named one of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll.[1][2]

- During the first Clovis session, drummer Dave Alldred used a cotton-stuffed cardboard box for lack of proper drums.

- In later years, he contrasted his clean-cut youth image by growing whiskers and wearing gaudy country-western outfits.
