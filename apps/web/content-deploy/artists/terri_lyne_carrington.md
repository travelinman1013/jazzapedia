## Biography
Terri Lyne Carrington, born on August 4, 1965, in Medford, Massachusetts (with some sources noting Malden), grew up in a musical family; her grandfather Matt Carrington was a drummer who played with Fats Waller, Gene Ammons, and Duke Ellington, and her father Sonny Carrington was also a musician who championed her early career. Discovering her grandfather's drumset at age seven, she began lessons and at ten became the youngest person to receive a Boston Musicians’ Association union card, playing her first professional gig with Clark Terry, whom she later joined regularly in 1983. At eleven, after jamming with Oscar Peterson, she earned a full scholarship to Berklee College of Music, studying under master drummer Alan Dawson and immersing herself in jazz history while performing with legends like Dizzy Gillespie, Les McCann, Joe Williams, and others.[1][2][3][4][7]
