## Biography
Marie-Pierre Arthur is a Québécois singer-songwriter born in Grande-Vallée, Gaspé, Quebec, who emerged as a solo artist in 2009 after establishing herself as a versatile and accomplished session musician. Before releasing music under her own name, she worked as a bassist and backing vocalist for prominent Québécois acts including Mara Tremblay, Karkwa, Ariane Moffatt, Steffie Shock, and Edith Butler, earning recognition for her distinctive voice, technical skill on the Höfner bass, and understated stage presence. Her transition to a solo career came from an irresistible creative impulse—she described feeling like "a prisoner of my obsession" as she developed her own material, ultimately releasing her debut album in the winter of 2009 with a collection of folk songs that would establish her as a significant voice in contemporary Québécois music.

Arthur's musical style blends intimate folk with country, rock, and chanson influences, creating what has been described as North-Americana with warm bass tones and joyful instrumentation. Her debut album earned substantial critical recognition, including three ADISQ nominations (Discovery of the Year, Popular Song for "Pourquoi," and Contemporary Folk Album), an Indie Music Awards nomination for Best Francophone Album, and accolades from Radio-Canada, which named her one of their discoveries of 2009-2010. She also received the André "Dédé" Fortin Prize from the SPACQ and the Chanson populaire prize from the SOCAN. Her songwriting explores the delicate workings of the heart, personal truth, and the courage required to confront one's darker impulses, with lyrics intentionally crafted to leave space for listener interpretation rather than prescribing specific narratives.

Arthur's artistic approach has drawn comparisons to artists such as Cat Power, Emily Haines, and Eleni Mandell. She built her reputation through extensive touring across Québec, Ontario, and France, often performing sold-out shows. Remarkably, she completed her final tour as an expectant mother, giving birth in June 2010, and returned to performing in both Europe and Canada by fall of that year, demonstrating her commitment to her evolving musical career.
