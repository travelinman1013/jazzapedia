## Biography
Brothers and Sisters is an obscure country/rock band formed by siblings Will Courtney and Lilly Courtney. Will, born in Nashville and raised mostly in Texas, is the son of Christian music singer Cynthia Clawson and author Ragan Courtney. After moving to Los Angeles, where he immersed himself in the classic Southern California country/rock sound, Will returned to Austin, Texas, and formed the band with his sister Lilly.[1]

The band released two albums: a self-titled debut featuring the song 'One Night,' a loping rocker with lead vocals by Will and harmonies by Lilly, and a follow-up titled *Fortunately*. Their musical style draws from influences like the Jayhawks, Byrds, the Band, Beatles, and Beach Boys, blending country/rock with harmonious sibling vocals.[1][5]

Although the band is no longer recording, with Will Courtney pursuing a solo career, their work remains a niche gem in the Americana and country/rock genres, appreciated for its heartfelt sibling chemistry and classic SoCal influences.[1]
