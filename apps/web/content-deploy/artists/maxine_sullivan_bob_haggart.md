## Biography
Maxine Sullivan was a jazz vocalist born in the early 1900s in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, who became one of the finest jazz singers of the swing era. She was discovered while singing at the Benjamin Harrison Literary Club in Pittsburgh by pianist Gladys Mosier, who introduced her to pianist and arranger Claude Thornhill. This connection led to her first recordings in August 1937, which included a swing arrangement of the Scottish folk song "Loch Lomond" that became her signature hit and established her as a major jazz vocalist. Sullivan's early success was marked by her light, intimate vocal style and her work at the Onyx Club on West 52nd Street in Manhattan, where she formed both a musical and personal partnership with bassist John Kirby, whom she married in 1938.

After achieving considerable success in the late 1930s and 1940s, Sullivan stepped away from performing in 1958 to work as a nurse and focus on family life and community service in the Bronx. However, she made a remarkable comeback starting in the mid-1960s, returning to the stage with considerable success. She performed and recorded with bassist Bob Haggart's World's Greatest Jazz Band and collaborated with other jazz pioneers living in New York City throughout the late 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. Sullivan remained active as a vocalist for approximately half a century, from the mid-1930s until her death in 1987, earning recognition as a precursor to better-known vocalists such as Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday, and Sarah Vaughan, and influencing later artists like Peggy Lee.
