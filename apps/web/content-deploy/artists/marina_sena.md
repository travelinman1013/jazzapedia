## Biography
Marina Sena, born Marina de Oliveira Sena on September 26, 1996, in Taiobeiras, Minas Gerais, Brazil, displayed an early passion for music, composing songs by age 15 and appearing on The Voice Brasil at 17. As a teenager, she relocated to Montes Claros in the same state, where she became lead singer of the local band A Outra Banda da Lua in 2015, releasing an album and EP that honed her artistic skills in MPB styles. She later joined Rosa Neon in 2019, achieving national recognition with their hit 'Ombrim' before the band's disbandment in 2020 following their farewell track 'A Gente É Demais'.[2][3][1][6]

In 2021, Sena launched her solo career with the single 'Me Toca,' released via rapper Djonga's Quadrilha label, followed by her debut album *De Primeira*, which blended **Brazilian pop**, **new MPB**, reggae, funk carioca, and samba, becoming a massive hit. Tracks like 'Por Supuesto' topped Spotify's Viral 50 Global and Brazil charts, earning her three Multishow Brazilian Music Awards (Revelation of the Year, Best Experimental, Best Album) and Latin Grammy nominations. She performed at major festivals including Rock in Rio, Lollapalooza, and Roskilde. In 2023, she signed with Sony Music, releasing *Vício Inerente* with singles like 'Tudo Pra Amar Você' and a collaboration 'Que Tal' with Fleezus, plus a tribute to Alcione.[2][1][3][6]

Sena's 2024 collaboration 'Escada do Prédio' with Pedro Sampaio hit No. 7 on Billboard Brasil Hot 100, and she released her third album *Coisas Naturais* on March 31, 2025, exploring organic aesthetics. Her style fuses pop with Brazilian regional genres, drawing comparisons to Gal Costa and Marisa Monte, while emphasizing identity-driven pop.[3][6][2]
