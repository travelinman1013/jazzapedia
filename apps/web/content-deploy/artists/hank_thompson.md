## Biography
Henry William 'Hank' Thompson was born on September 3, 1925, in Waco, Texas, to Bohemian immigrant parents. From an early age, he showed a passion for music, winning harmonica contests as a child and later taking up the guitar. As a teenager, he broadcast as 'Hank the Hired Hand' on Waco radio, graduated high school in 1943, and enlisted in the U.S. Navy, where he performed music over South Pacific radio networks. After his discharge, Thompson studied electrical engineering at Southern Methodist University, the University of Texas, and Princeton University—the only country artist known to attend the latter—but ultimately chose music over engineering[1][2][3][4][5].

Returning to Waco, he formed the Brazos Valley Boys western swing band in 1946, named after the local Brazos River, and recorded his debut 'Whoa Sailor' for Globe Records, followed by a Capitol Records contract in 1947 thanks to Tex Ritter. His first major hit, 'Humpty Dumpty Heart,' reached number two in 1948, launching a career of hits like 'The Wild Side of Life' (number one for 32 weeks in 1952), 'Rub-A-Dub-Dub,' and 'A Six Pack to Go.' Thompson pioneered innovations including the first country live album (*Live at the Golden Nugget*, 1961), high-fidelity stereo recordings, color TV broadcasts (*The Hank Thompson Show*, 1953-1957), corporate sponsorships, and self-piloted flights to gigs with his own sound and light systems[1][2][3][4][5]. His style blended honky-tonk with a 'light' western swing, featuring twin fiddles, steel guitar, and electric guitar behind his smooth baritone, distinguishing it from Bob Wills' heavier soloing[3].

Thompson's Brazos Valley Boys dominated *Billboard*'s top country western band poll for 13-14 years (1953-1965/66), and he released hits across seven decades, culminating in *Seven Decades* (2000). He sold over 60 million records, earned Country Music Hall of Fame induction in 1989 and Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1997, and influenced country-rock before passing from lung cancer on November 6, 2007[1][2][3][4][6].
