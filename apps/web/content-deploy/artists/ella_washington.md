## Biography
Ella Washington, born on October 25, 1943, in Miami, Florida, began her music career in 1965 with local label Octavia, releasing 'The Grass Always Seems Greener,' which was leased to Atlantic Records but failed to chart commercially[1][2]. In 1967, she signed with Nashville's Sound Stage 7 label, where several singles were produced by radio disc jockey John Richbourg and recorded at the renowned Muscle Shoals studios in Alabama, showcasing her raw, intense Southern soul style rooted in R&B and gospel influences[1][2][4]. Her breakthrough came with the 1969 single 'He Called Me Baby,' a soulful reworking of Harlan Howard's country tune previously recorded by artists like Bobby Bare and Patsy Cline, peaking at #77 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #38 on the R&B chart; she released a self-titled LP that year and continued issuing singles like 'Stop Giving Your Man Away' and 'Trying To Make You Love Me' until 1972[1][2].

In 1973, Washington transitioned from secular music to gospel, performing hymns such as 'Amazing Grace' and 'Because He Lives' at Richbourg's 1986 funeral[1][2]. By 2009, as Ella Washington Cobbs, she had become pastor at Theos Ministries church in Opa-locka, Miami-Dade County, Florida, marking a profound shift toward spiritual leadership while leaving a legacy as an underappreciated Southern soul powerhouse[1][2][5]. Compilations like 'Nobody But Me' (Charly Records, 1987) and 'He Called Me Baby' (Soulscape, 2009) have preserved her recordings for later audiences[1][2].
