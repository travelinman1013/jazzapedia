## Biography
The Mason-Dixon Orchestra was a pseudonymous recording ensemble that operated during the jazz era of the late 1920s. On May 15, 1929, a contingent of the Paul Whiteman Orchestra recorded two sides for Columbia Records under this assumed name: "What A Day" and "Alabammy Snow." The pseudonym was likely employed as an inside joke, connected to the catalogue number assigned to the recording. This ensemble represents a footnote in jazz history, capturing a moment when established orchestras would record under alternate identities, a practice not uncommon during the early recording industry.
