## Biography
The Pine Leaf Boys are an American Cajun and Creole band formed in 2004 or 2005 in Lafayette, South Louisiana, by accordionist Wilson Savoy, whose family has deep roots in Cajun music. Wilson, son of legendary accordionist and instrument maker Marc Savoy and singer-guitarist Ann Savoy, received his first accordion crafted by his father from sassafras wood planted by his grandfather. Inspired by boogie-woogie piano legends like Jerry Lee Lewis, Wilson grew up immersed in traditional sounds from Cajun icons such as Dennis McGee, Dewey Balfa, and Wayne Fruge. The band started unconventionally by busking on the University of Louisiana at Lafayette campus, where members Drew Simon and Thomas David were born and raised, only to be kicked off for disturbing the peace—a story that propelled them into local media and gigs.[1][2][3][4][5]

Quickly evolving from street performers, the Pine Leaf Boys landed bar and dance hall shows, released records, and embarked on their first European tour within a year. They play traditional Cajun and Creole music from Southwest Louisiana, drawing from 1920s pioneers like Amédé Ardoin to modern acts like Mamou Playboys, Jason Frey, Paul Daigle, Cajun Gold, and Wayne Toups, blending fiddle-and-accordion styles with country, western, blues, and Caribbean influences. Known for wild shows and thoughtful arrangements, they've released five studio albums, including two on Valcour Records owned by Wilson's brother Joel, earned three Grammy nominations, and toured internationally as U.S. State Department cultural ambassadors in the Middle East (2009, including Saudi Arabia, UAE, Jerusalem), Asia, and Eastern Europe. Wilson Savoy taught Cajun music at UL Lafayette.[1][2][3][4][6][7]

Current members include Wilson Savoy (accordion, piano, vocals), Chris Segura (fiddle, vocals, joined 2020), Drew Simon (drums, vocals), Jean Dutile Bertrand (guitars), and Thomas David (bass), all Lafayette-area natives steeped in the local scene. Former member Courtney Granger, who played from 2008 until health issues, passed away in 2021 from diabetes complications; he appeared with Savoy and Cedric Watson in HBO's Treme. The band continues to energize Acadiana dance halls while maintaining global appeal.[2][5]
