## Biography
Charlotte Emma Aitchison, known professionally as Charli xcx, was born on August 2, 1992, in Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, United Kingdom.[2] She began her recording career at an unusually young age, persuading her parents to grant her a loan at 14 to record her first album, which she self-released and promoted on MySpace starting in 2008.[3] This early online presence caught the attention of promoters in East London's underground rave scene, leading to her first live performances at age 16.[1] After signing with Asylum Records (a Warner subsidiary) in 2010, she relocated between London and Los Angeles to develop her craft, attending the Slade School of Fine Art before dropping out during her second year to fully pursue music.[1]

Charli XCX initially gained recognition as a songwriter and featured artist rather than a solo performer. Her co-writing credit on Swedish duo Icona Pop's 2012 single "I Love It" became her first number-one hit in the UK and peaked at number 7 on the Billboard Hot 100.[1] Her debut studio album, *True Romance* (2013), received critical acclaim but limited commercial success.[3] However, her 2014 collaboration with Iggy Azalea on "Fancy" topped the Billboard Hot 100 and earned two Grammy nominations, while her solo single "Boom Clap" (released for *The Fault in Our Stars* soundtrack) peaked at number 8 on the Hot 100.[1][2] Throughout the mid-2010s, she developed an increasingly experimental electronic-pop sound, collaborating with UK collective PC Music and establishing her own avant-garde label, Vroom Vroom Recordings, in 2016.[2]

Charli XCX achieved mainstream breakthrough success with her sixth studio album, *BRAT*, released in June 2024.[1][2] The album debuted at number 3 in the United States, led the UK charts by fall, and spawned viral moments including a TikTok dance to the track "Apple."[1] *BRAT* earned eight Grammy nominations at the February 2, 2025 ceremony, with Charli XCX winning three awards: Best Dance/Electronic Album, Best Dance Pop Recording for "Von dutch," and Best Recording Package.[1] In October 2024, she released *Brat and it's completely different but also still brat*, a remixed version featuring collaborations with Billie Eilish, Ariana Grande, Lorde, and Kesha, further cementing her status as a boundary-pushing artist who balances experimental innovation with mainstream appeal.[1]
