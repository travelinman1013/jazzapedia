## Biography
The Elliott Caine Sextet is a jazz ensemble led by Elliott Caine, a trumpeter and composer born in Indianapolis, Indiana, who began playing trumpet at age 11 and continued through middle and high school bands.[6] Caine studied music with renowned jazz legend David Baker at Indiana University and drew inspiration from trumpet masters Freddie Hubbard, Clifford Brown, and Miles Davis.[1][9] After establishing himself in Indianapolis performing with the Jimmy Coe Big Band, Caine relocated to Los Angeles where he developed a parallel career as both an accomplished optometrist and professional musician, earning the nickname "the jazz optometrist."[1][2]

Inspired by 1960s Blue Note-style jazz as well as the music of Tito Puente and Mongo Santamaria, the Elliott Caine Sextet (also performing as a Quintet) plays original compositions alongside works by jazz standards composers like Lee Morgan, Hank Mobley, and Donald Byrd.[1][3] The group has recorded four CDs that achieved national and international airplay and critical acclaim: "Orientation" (1999), which reached #1 Most Added for jazz nationally and #29 on the Gavin Jazz List; "Le Supercool" (2001), which ranked #14 on U.S. jazz radio; and "Blues from Mars" (2006), which featured vibraphonist DJ Bonebrake and received positive reviews in Jazz Times Magazine, Latin Beat Magazine, and international publications.[1][2]

Throughout his career, Caine has performed at prestigious festivals including the Playboy Jazz Festival, Equinoxe Jazz Festival in Corsica, Atlas Music Festival in Istanbul, Temecula Valley International Jazz Festival, and numerous venues across Southern California.[1][2] His compositions have been featured in film and television productions, including the movie "Relax...It's Just Sex" starring Jennifer Tilly and Paul Winfield.[1] Caine received recognition from the City and County of Los Angeles for his musical contributions and was honored as a Los Angeles Music Week Honoree in 2005.[1]
