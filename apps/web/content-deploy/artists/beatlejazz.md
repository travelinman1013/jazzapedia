## Biography
Beatlejazz is a jazz ensemble founded by drummer Brian Melvin and pianist Dave Kikoski, dedicated to jazz interpretations of The Beatles' music. Established after Melvin's move to New York in the 1980s, the group emerged from their collaborative explorations, recording over 40 Beatles songs—the most in jazz history. They have released four albums, with the third and fourth featuring guest artists like Michael and Randy Brecker, Richard Bona, Joe Lovano, John Scofield, Mike Stern, Toots Thielemans, Larry Grenadier, and Boris Kozlov; these reached the top ten on the Gavin radio charts and supported tours in the US, Europe, and Asia.[1][2][5] In 2025, Melvin and Kikoski released Reunion, revisiting Beatles classics through a jazz lens.[3]

Brian Melvin, born in San Francisco, began his career playing with Mike Stern via connections through Jaco Pastorius and later formed Beatlejazz with Kikoski. Melvin's style emphasizes collaborative interplay over showboating, drawing from his experiences in jazz, rock, and world music. Kikoski, born in 1961 in Milltown, NJ, trained classically from age six, studied at Berklee College of Music, and built a reputation in New York alongside luminaries like Roy Haynes and Randy Brecker before co-founding Beatlejazz.[1][2] The duo's music transforms Beatles tunes into sophisticated jazz standards, akin to the trios of Bill Evans and Keith Jarrett.[5]

Beatlejazz's legacy lies in bridging pop and jazz, creating accessible yet innovative reinterpretations that highlight groove and improvisation. Their work has sustained popularity in smooth jazz circles, as noted on Spotify, and continues with recent releases like Reunion, affirming their enduring appeal.[3]
