## Biography
Bertha Henderson was an early 20th-century American blues singer known as a contralto, composer, and lyricist, active in the pre-war country blues and ragtime scenes. Little is known about her early life, including her birth date and place, but she recorded during a brief period in 1925-1926, dying sometime in the 20th century. Her career centered on a small number of recordings made for Paramount Records, capturing the raw energy of classic female blues vocals typical of the era.

Henderson's musical style aligned with **country blues**, characterized by emotive singing often backed by guitar, as heard in her collaborations. She recorded several sides with the acclaimed ragtime guitarist **Blind Blake**, showcasing a Piedmont-influenced sound with intricate fingerpicking and themes of heartbreak and longing in songs like 'Terrible Murder Blues' and 'Lead Hearted Blues.' These 1926 sessions highlight her role in the transitional period between vaudeville blues and rawer country styles.

Her legacy is niche due to limited output and obscurity, preserved in reissues like Document Records' compilations of Blind Blake's works. With Spotify popularity at 0, she remains a footnote for blues historians, exemplifying the many forgotten female artists of the 1920s race records era whose contributions influenced later performers.
