## Biography
Dr. Orlando Owoh (1932–2008) was born Stephen Oladipupo Olaore Owomoyela on February 14, 1932, in Osogbo, Nigeria, to a building contractor father and seamstress mother, with ancestral roots in Ifon in Ondo State. He initially pursued carpentry as a young man before joining Nigeria's Kola Ogunmola Theatre Group in the mid-1950s, where he performed drums and sang, notably entertaining Queen Elizabeth during her 1956 visit to Ibadan. After performing with several bands including Dele Jolly's group and the Fakunle Major Band, and studying guitar informally under musician Fatai 'Rolling Dollar' Olagunju, Owoh formed Dr. Orlando Owoh and His Omimah Band around 1960, launching his recording career with singles like "Oluwa, Lo Ran Mi" on the Decca label.

Owoh's career trajectory was interrupted by Nigeria's civil war (1967–1970), during which he fought for the Nigerian government against Biafran rebels. Upon his return to music, he achieved major success with the hit "Oriki Ilu Oke," which spread his fame to Nigerian expatriate communities. In 1972, he performed in London at a graduation ceremony for Nigerian law students alongside South African legend Miriam Makeba, where he received an honorary doctorate in music, thereafter becoming known as Dr. Orlando Owoh. He subsequently led multiple bands including the Young Kenneries (formed 1975) and the African Kenneries International, becoming a household name across generational lines in Nigeria.

Dubbed the "King of Toye" for his distinctive highlife style that blended traditional elements with modern instrumentation—particularly his pioneering use of the conga drum in Nigerian music—Owoh remained popular even as Nigerian musical tastes shifted toward juju and fuji styles. He released at least a dozen albums between 1990 and 2005, and in 2000 launched a lawsuit against Decca seeking back royalties. After suffering a stroke in the early 2000s and the death of broadcaster friend Gbenga Adeboye, Owoh's health declined; his final album was released in 2006. He died on November 4, 2008, at age 76, leaving behind a legacy as one of Nigeria's most innovative and talented musicians.
