## Biography
Dawn Angeliqué Richard, born August 5, 1983, in New Orleans, Louisiana, began performing in her early teens with a local group called Realiti and was discovered at a 2004 live performance at Tipitina's Uptown, leading to an initial recording deal with Yeah! Brother Records. Her breakthrough came auditioning for MTV's Making the Band 3 in 2004, where she secured a spot in the girl group Danity Kane alongside Aubrey O'Day, Aundrea Fimbres, D. Woods, and Shannon Bex, signing with Sean 'Diddy' Combs' Bad Boy Records. The group achieved massive success, becoming the first all-female group in Billboard history to debut their first two albums at number one, though they disbanded in 2009 amid internal conflicts.[1][2]

Post-Danity Kane, Richard joined Diddy – Dirty Money with Combs and Kalenna Harper, releasing the critically acclaimed Last Train to Paris (2010) and mixtapes before the group's 2012 disbandment. Departing Bad Boy Records in 2011, she launched her solo career as DΔWN (later DAWN), releasing a trilogy of innovative albums—Goldenheart (2013), Blackheart (2015), and Redemption (2016)—that blended alternative dance, electronic, and R&B influences, marking a shift from pop to experimental sounds reflective of her vocal growth and personal identity.[1][2] Subsequent albums New Breed (2019) and Second Line (2021), the latter rooted in New Orleans' brass band tradition amid personal hardships like Hurricane Katrina and family illnesses, earned critical acclaim; she signed with Merge Records in 2021 while maintaining independence.[3][4]

Richard's musical style evolved from pop-R&B group dynamics to genre-blending artistry incorporating electronic, dance, hip-hop, and New Orleans bounce, often self-produced with partner Kyle Cabrol. Her legacy lies in pioneering Black innovation in electronic and dance genres, embedding personal struggles and cultural heritage into visually and sonically ambitious work, influencing perceptions of independent Black women in music despite industry hurdles.[2][4]
