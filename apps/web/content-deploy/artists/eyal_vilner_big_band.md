## Biography
Eyal Vilner, born in Tel Aviv, Israel, is a saxophonist, clarinetist, flutist, composer, arranger, and bandleader who developed a passion for swing era jazz and big band music from an early age. He moved to New York City in 2007 and formed the Eyal Vilner Big Band the following year, quickly establishing himself as a leading voice in the New York and global swing scene. His musical style draws deeply from jazz, swing, and blues traditions, featuring original compositions and fresh arrangements of classics, performed with a focus on the interplay between sound and movement that appeals to dancers[1][2][3].

The band has performed at iconic venues like Lincoln Center, the Guggenheim, Birdland, Dizzy's Club, Smalls, Minton’s Playhouse, and Central Park SummerStage, as well as international festivals in Israel and Paris. Vilner's interest in jazz-dance fusion led him to co-create and serve as musical director for the groundbreaking production SW!NG OUT at the Joyce Theater, which toured the US including Jacob’s Pillow and the LA Music Center, and collaborations with events like the International Lindy Hop Championships and Midsummer Night's Swing. Albums such as Introducing the Eyal Vilner Big Band, Almost Sunrise, Hanukkah, Swing Out!, Live in Washington Square Park!, The Jam!, and Swingin’ Uptown have topped jazz radio charts in the US and Canada, earning rave reviews for their exuberant swing and bop-infused sound[1][2][4][5][6].

Vilner's legacy lies in revitalizing big band swing for contemporary audiences, blending historical reverence—especially for Harlem's jazz narrative and 1920s-1940s jitterbug eras—with modern innovation, while leading ensembles of top New York talent in both 10- and 17-piece formats favored by global Lindy Hop festivals[2][3][5][6].
