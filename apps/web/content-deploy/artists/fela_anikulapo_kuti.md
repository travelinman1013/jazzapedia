## Biography
Fela Anikulapo Kuti was born on October 15, 1938, in Abeokuta, Colonial Nigeria, into the prominent Ransome-Kuti family. His mother, Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti, was a renowned anti-colonial feminist and activist, while his father, Israel Oludotun Ransome-Kuti, was an Anglican minister and educator who served as the first president of the Nigeria Union of Teachers. As a youth, Kuti received training in piano and percussion before studying classical music at Trinity College of Music in London starting in 1959, where he formed his first band, Koola Lobitos, blending highlife and jazz influences.[1][2][3]

Returning to Nigeria in the mid-1960s, Kuti evolved Koola Lobitos into Africa '70, pioneering Afrobeat—a fusion of jazz, highlife, funk, and traditional Yoruba rhythms with politically charged lyrics critiquing corruption, colonialism, and military oppression. In 1970, he established the Kalakuta Republic, a communal compound he declared independent, which served as a home, recording studio, and performance space at the Afrika Shrine nightclub. His activism led to over 200 arrests, brutal raids—including a 1977 army attack that killed his mother—and a 20-month imprisonment in 1984 on politically motivated charges. Kuti changed his name to Anikulapo ('he who carries death in his pouch') and married 27 women in 1978 to protect them legally.[1][2][3]

Kuti's legacy as Afrobeat's innovator endures through his 50+ albums, his formation of the Movement of the People political party, and influence on global music. He passed away on August 2, 1997, in Lagos from AIDS-related complications, leaving a profound impact on activism and African music.[1][2][3]
