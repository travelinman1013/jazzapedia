## Biography
Luísa Taubkin Maita was born on April 27, 1982, in São Paulo, Brazil, specifically in the Bela Vista neighborhood (also known as Bixiga), into a deeply musical family. Her father, composer and musician Amado Maita, immersed her in samba from his experiences in Bixiga, while her mother, Myriam Taubkin, is a singer and music producer. Named after a song by bossa nova pioneer Antonio Carlos Jobim, Maita grew up singing samba, bossa nova, and her father's compositions at home, beginning to record jingles at age seven. In 2001, she founded her first band, Urbanda, with Morris Picciotto, but left to pursue solo work. Early contributions included writing songs for Virginia Rosa's *Samba a Dois* (2006) and co-writing 'Beleza' with Rodrigo Campos for Mariana Aydar's album, named one of 2009's best by *Rolling Stone Brazil*.

Her debut solo album, *Lero-Lero*, released in 2010 by Cumbancha internationally and Oi Música in Brazil, blended traditional Brazilian samba, bossa nova, and MPB with modern electronic, pop, soul, and jazz influences, inspired by São Paulo's urban energy. Hailed as 'The New Voice of Brazil' by NPR, she won Best New Artist at the 2011 Brazilian Music Awards and toured Europe and North America. Her second album, *Fio da Memória* (2016), expanded with downtempo electronica, synths, and English tracks, reflecting globalized São Paulo. Songs from her work appeared in Richard Linklater's *Boyhood* (2014), and she performed at high-profile events like Jazz at Lincoln Center and João Donato's 80th birthday concerts.

Maita's style fuses acoustic Brazilian roots with contemporary electronic and global sounds, influenced by artists like Billie Holiday, Chet Baker, Michael Jackson, Sade, Kid Cudi, Nana Vasconcelos, João Gilberto, Tom Jobim, and others. Her legacy includes honoring her father's music through tributes and establishing herself as a key modern voice in Brazilian music, with ongoing performances and recordings.
