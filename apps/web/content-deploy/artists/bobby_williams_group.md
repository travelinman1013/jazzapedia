## Biography
The Bobby Williams Group was a New Orleans-based funk and R&B ensemble active in the mid-1960s, renowned for their percussive, bouncy rhythms that captured the Mardi Gras Indian street parade feel. Led by drummer Bobby Williams, the core lineup included guitarist Louis 'June' Clark and bassist Paul Boudreaux. They gained prominence as the frequent rhythm section for producer Eddie Bo on Seven B Records, notably backing his 1968 duet 'Lover And A Friend' with Inez Cheatham, which became a local hit and UK Northern Soul favorite after Capitol Records leased it nationally[3]. Their signature track, 'Boogaloo Mardi Gras' (1968, Capitol 2201), showcased Williams' exceptionally funky, drum-heavy beats with a syncopated New Orleans groove, predating similar recordings by groups like the Wild Magnolias[3].

Williams' drumming style emphasized a 'bouncy beat' over straight backbeats, drawing criticism but earning praise for its rhythmic innovation in local funk scenes. The group operated on the fringes due to limited budgets and eccentric instincts, yet their raw energy influenced New Orleans music's evolution toward funk[3]. No further recordings under the group name are documented after 1968, suggesting a short-lived tenure primarily as a session unit[3]. Bobby Williams himself later pursued Jersey Shore rock in the early 1970s with acts like the Big Bad Bobby Williams Band, but the Group's legacy endures in rare funk compilations[1][3][4].
