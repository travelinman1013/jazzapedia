## Biography
Paul Norris Bollenback was born on June 6, 1959, and began his musical journey at age seven when his father, a classically trained trumpeter, gave him a nylon-string guitar.[1] His early exposure to diverse musical traditions came during a formative three-year period when his family relocated to New Delhi, India, where he cultivated a lifelong interest in exotic musical sounds and timbres.[1][8] Upon returning to the United States, his father purchased him an electric guitar, and Bollenback initially gravitated toward rock and roll, drawing inspiration from artists like Carlos Santana, Led Zeppelin, and Black Sabbath.[2] His musical trajectory shifted dramatically when he heard Miles Davis, fundamentally changing his artistic direction.[1] He attended the University of Miami as a music major and later studied privately for eight years with Baltimore-based professor Asher Zlotnik in theory and composition.[1][3]

Bollenback's professional career began in 1981 and gained significant momentum in the late 1980s and 1990s.[5] He made his first recording with saxophonist Gary Thomas in 1987 and met organist Joey DeFrancesco in 1990, establishing a collaborative relationship that lasted decades.[2] His emotionally expressive style and eclectic approach developed through influences including Wes Montgomery, George Benson, John Scofield, Pat Metheny, Kenny Burrell, Herbie Hancock, and Jimi Hendrix.[3][7] In 1997, Bollenback was named Musician of the Year at the Washington Area Music Awards and became an Adjunct Professor of Music at American University in Washington, DC.[1][3] He subsequently relocated to New York City, where he established himself as a versatile jazz guitarist, recording artist, composer, and educator.[4] His discography includes notable albums such as *Original Visions*, *Double Gemini* (1997), and *Soul Grooves*, with *Double Gemini* winning CD of the Month honors from both Jim Fisch's jazz column in 20th Century Jazz Magazine and the renowned jazz radio station WBGO in Newark, New Jersey.[1][2]

Bollenback has maintained an active presence in the jazz community through performances at prestigious venues including the Blue Note in New York City and Fukuoka, Japan, and the Newark Museum and Rochester Jazz Festival.[3] He has appeared on major television programs including The Tonight Show, The Today Show, Good Morning America, Joan Rivers, and Entertainment Tonight.[3][6] Currently, he teaches at Queens College, the New School, and the Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore, and has been a resident artist at the Litchfield Jazz Camp since 1999.[3] His versatility as both a sideman and bandleader has made him a respected figure in contemporary jazz.

## Fun Facts
