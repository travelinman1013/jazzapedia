## Biography
Honey Cone was an American R&B and soul girl group formed in 1968 in Los Angeles, California, by lead singer Edna Wright (born February 2, 1945, sister of Darlene Love), along with Carolyn Willis and Shelly Clark. Wright, who had a gospel background singing with the Church of God in Christ Singers, brought secular R&B experience from prior solo work under the name Sandy Wynns. The trio caught the attention of Eddie Holland of the Holland-Dozier-Holland team, who had recently left Motown to start Hot Wax Records; he signed them as the label's first act, naming them Honey Cone after his favorite ice cream flavor despite initial resistance from the members. Based in Los Angeles, they recorded in Detroit, producing Northern-style soul with a Motown influence blending sweetness and grit, inspired by groups like Martha & the Vandellas and The Marvelettes.

Their debut single 'While You're Out Looking for Sugar' (1969) reached No. 26 on the Billboard R&B chart, followed by 'Girls, It Ain't Easy' peaking at No. 8. Breakthrough success came with 'Want Ads' (1971), which topped both the Billboard Hot 100 and R&B charts, selling over a million copies and earning a gold disc. They followed with another No. 1 R&B hit 'Stick-Up' (No. 11 pop), and further successes like 'One Monkey Don't Stop No Show' (No. 5 R&B). The group released four albums—Take Me with You (1970), Sweet Replies (1971), Soulful Tapestry (1971), and Love, Peace & Soul (1972)—and were named Best Female Vocal Group by NATRA in 1971. Most songs were written by General Johnson and Greg Perry, Wright's boyfriend who also contributed musically. The original trio disbanded around 1973 after nine R&B Top 40 hits.

Honey Cone's legacy endures in northern soul, classic soul, and Motown genres, with a 2024 reunion led by Shelly Clark alongside new members Kathy Merrick and Wendy Smith-Brune. Edna Wright passed away on September 12, 2020, but the group's upbeat 'bubblegum soul' sound—marked by catchy hooks and pop-influenced arrangements—continues to influence soul enthusiasts.
