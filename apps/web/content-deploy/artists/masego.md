## Biography
Micah Davis, known professionally as Masego, was born on June 8, 1993, in Kingston, Jamaica, to a Jamaican father in the U.S. Air Force and a Georgia-born African-American mother; both parents were pastors, providing a strict Christian upbringing filled with gospel music that shaped his early exposure to Black musical icons like Stevie Wonder, Aretha Franklin, and Cab Calloway. The family led a nomadic life due to his father's military career, eventually settling in Virginia during middle school, where Masego, largely self-taught via YouTube, mastered drums, piano, and saxophone after being inspired by a church drummer at age eight; despite restrictions on secular music like hip-hop, he discovered trap beats through neighborhood friends and began experimenting in college at open mic nights, using a looper pedal to blend freestyles, rapping, scatting, and saxophone.[1][4][5][6][7]

Masego's career gained momentum with early releases like the 2015 collaborative EP *The Pink Polo EP* with Medasin and his 2016 solo EP *Loose Thoughts*, but he broke through internationally with the 2017 improvised track 'Tadow' alongside French artist FKJ, which amassed hundreds of millions of streams and led to his gold-certified debut album *Lady Lady* in 2018, featuring guests like SiR and Tiffany Gouché. He coined his signature 'TrapHouseJazz' style—a fusion of trap, jazz, R&B, hip-hop, and Caribbean influences—evident in subsequent works like the 2020 EP *Studying Abroad* (later extended and Grammy-nominated in 2022), collaborations on Drake's *Certified Lover Boy*, and his 2023 self-titled album; his multifaceted talents as saxophonist, singer, rapper, producer, and DJ have earned him a Grammy nomination and sold-out global tours.[1][2][3][4]

Masego's legacy lies in revitalizing saxophone-driven innovation within contemporary music, bridging 1930s Harlem jazz vibes with modern trap and R&B, influencing a new wave of genre-blending artists while maintaining a sultry, emotive presence; his nomadic roots and self-taught ethos underscore his authentic, boundary-pushing sound that continues to evolve, as seen in recent setbacks like losing his Los Angeles home in the 2025 California fires.[2][3][4]
