## Biography
Wayne Shorter (August 25, 1933 – March 2, 2023) was an American jazz saxophonist, composer, and bandleader widely regarded as one of the most important and influential figures in modern jazz history.[1] Born in Newark, New Jersey, Shorter studied at New York University (graduating with a B.M.E. in 1956) and served in the U.S. Army from 1956 to 1958.[3] His early influences included Sonny Rollins, John Coltrane, and Coleman Hawkins.[1] After brief stints with the Horace Silver quintet and Maynard Ferguson's big band, Shorter rose to mainstream prominence in 1959 when he joined Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers, where he remained until 1963 and became the ensemble's primary composer and musical director.[1][3]

In 1964, Miles Davis invited Shorter to join his Second Great Quintet, alongside Herbie Hancock, Tony Williams, and Ron Carter—a six-year collaboration that helped shape one of the most innovative periods in jazz history.[1][5] During this period, Shorter also recorded a series of classic albums under his own name for Blue Note Records, including *Night Dreamer*, *Juju*, *Speak No Evil*, *Adam's Apple*, and *Super Nova*.[4] In 1970, he co-founded Weather Report with keyboardist Joe Zawinul and bassist Miroslav Vitous, pioneering the jazz fusion genre and achieving international success for 14 years.[1][4] Shorter was especially acclaimed for his mastery of the soprano saxophone, dominating *DownBeat* magazine's annual polls from 1970 onward, winning the critics' poll for 10 consecutive years and the readers' poll for 18.[1]

Following Weather Report's dissolution, Shorter continued to record and perform in jazz fusion styles, collaborating with artists including Carlos Santana and contributing to projects by Joni Mitchell and Steely Dan.[4] In 2000, he formed a permanent acoustic quartet with pianist Danilo Perez, bassist John Patitucci, and drummer Brian Blade, recording live albums including *Footprints Live*, *Beyond the Sound Barrier*, *Without a Net*, and *Emanon*.[6] Over his career spanning more than six decades, Shorter received 12 Grammy Awards and the Polar Music Prize.[1] In 2008, *The New York Times* music critic Ben Ratliff described him as "probably jazz's greatest living small-group composer and a contender for greatest living improviser."[1] Shorter passed away on March 2, 2023, at age 89 in Los Angeles, California.[3]
