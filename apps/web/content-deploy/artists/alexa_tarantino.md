## Biography
Alexa Tarantino, born in 1992 in West Hartford, Connecticut, developed her musical talents through the award-winning music program at Hall High School before pursuing higher education at prestigious institutions. She earned bachelor's degrees in Jazz Saxophone Performance and Music Education from the Eastman School of Music in 2014, followed by a master's degree in Jazz Studies from The Juilliard School. A graduate of Eastman's Alumni Learning Program (ALP) Certificate, Tarantino quickly established herself as a leading young alto saxophonist, known for her vibrant performances, woodwind doubling, composing, and educational work in New York City's jazz scene.[1][6][9]

Tarantino's career has flourished through performances at iconic venues like Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola, Jazz Standard, Birdland Theater, Kennedy Center, Hollywood Bowl, and Rose Theater, as well as international festivals including Marciac and Umbria. She performs regularly with her own quartet, the co-led quintet LSAT with Lauren Sevian, and prestigious ensembles such as the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra under Wynton Marsalis, Darcy James Argue’s Secret Society, Cécile McLorin Salvant’s OGRESSE, Arturo O’Farrill & The Afro-Latin Jazz Orchestra, and Sherrie Maricle & the DIVA Jazz Orchestra. Her style is celebrated for 'exquisite soloing that is fresh, inspired, and original' and 'sharply plotted but gracefully unencumbered straight-ahead jazz compositions,' earning her accolades like Top 5 Alto Saxophonists of 2019 by JazzTimes Critics’ Poll and Rising Star nominations from DownBeat Magazine in 2020 and 2021.[2][4][6]

As an educator, Tarantino serves on faculty for Jazz at Lincoln Center's Youth Programs, including the High School Jazz Academy and Jazz for Young People, and previously taught at Hobart and William Smith Colleges. She founded and directs the Rockport Jazz Workshop in Massachusetts, which grew from 7 to 120 students in four years, co-founded A Step Ahead Jazz with Steven Feifke during the pandemic featuring guests like Wynton Marsalis, and launched The Alexa Approach virtual platform in 2021. Now based in New York City, she continues as a clinician worldwide and endorses Vandoren and Yamaha.[3][5][6]
