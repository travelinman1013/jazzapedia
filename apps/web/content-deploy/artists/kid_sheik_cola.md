## Biography
George Colar (1908–1996), better known as Kid Sheik Cola, was a New Orleans jazz trumpeter and bandleader renowned for his contributions to Dixieland and traditional jazz. Born on September 15, 1908, in New Orleans (with some sources noting Waggaman, Louisiana), he began playing trumpet at age 16, taking informal lessons from Wooden Joe Nicholas, whom he considered a mentor. Idolizing Chris Kelley, Colar emulated his style while adopting Nicholas's technique. By 1925, at age 18, he formed his own band and performed professionally around New Orleans, including in former Storyville areas, continuing for nearly two decades despite the economic hardships of the 1930s, when he supplemented income by sewing sugar sacks.[1][2][5]

In 1943, Kid Sheik enlisted in the U.S. Air Force, attending its school of music and leading a small group until 1945. Post-service, he collaborated with George Lewis in the late 1940s, then joined the Eureka Brass Band in 1952, replacing Eddie Richardson, and the Olympia Brass Band, remaining active with both into the 1990s. His recording career began in 1961, capturing his lead and solo trumpet style, as heard on albums like 'Kid Martyn in New Orleans with Kid Sheik's Band' (1963). He toured extensively, including England (1963) with Barry Martyn's band, Europe (1966) and New York (1968) with Captain John Handy, and Japan (1970) with Louis Nelson. In later years, he performed regularly at Preservation Hall, marrying pianist and singer Sadie Goodson in 1985, with whom he played duos and ensembles.[1][2]

Kid Sheik's legacy endures as a pillar of New Orleans jazz revival, honored as the subject of the 1990 New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival poster and featured in the 35mm film 'The Cradle Is Rocking' (directed by Frank Decola). He remained active into the 1980s at Preservation Hall and with local bands, embodying the enduring spirit of traditional jazz until his death on November 7, 1996.[1]
