## Biography
Zilla Florine Mays (September 1, 1931 – September 19, 1995), later known as Zilla Mays Hinton, was an American R&B and gospel singer born in the early 1930s who began her musical journey in the secular realm during her teenage years by performing with her brother Roy's band, the Roy Mays All Stars[1][2][3]. Transitioning from gospel roots, she recorded tracks like 'Why Do You Cry' with The Blues Caravan in 1954, establishing herself in the R&B scene, though her singing career remained modestly successful[3][4]. Beyond music, Mays carved a pioneering path as a radio DJ on WAOK in Atlanta, Georgia, where she became the first Black female radio announcer in the state, enjoying a lengthy career in broadcasting that outshone her recording achievements[1][5][6].

Her dual roles in music and radio highlighted her versatility in the mid-20th-century Black entertainment landscape, blending R&B performances with influential on-air presence in Atlanta's vibrant scene[1][6]. Mays' legacy endures as a trailblazer for women in radio, particularly as a Black pioneer in Georgia, despite limited commercial success in singing[6]. She passed away in 1995, leaving a mark through her multifaceted contributions to R&B, gospel, and broadcasting[3][4][5].
