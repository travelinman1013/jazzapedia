## Biography
Gary Brewer and the Kentucky Ramblers, a family band with roots spanning six generations, were formed in 1980 in West Point, Kentucky, by teenage guitarist and vocalist Gary Brewer. Surrounded by family musicians and old-time mountain music from an early age, Gary began playing professionally as a teen, honing his skills alongside bluegrass legends before launching the band. Their signature 'Brewgrass' style fuses bluegrass, country, rock, and Americana, reflecting their deep Kentucky heritage and innovative approach to roots music.[1][2][3]

Over four decades, the Ramblers have released 29 studio albums through various labels and 22 more via Gary's SGM Records (founded 1988), performing across all 50 U.S. states, Canada, and Europe. Key milestones include the 2020 '40th Anniversary Celebration' album, which topped the Billboard Bluegrass Albums chart for 16 weeks, ranked #3 in 2021 bluegrass sales, and featured guests like Sam Bush and The Travelin' McCourys. They also host the Friday Night Bluegrass series and operated Brewgrass Entertainment venue, while Gary built a family studio using album proceeds.[1][2][5]

The current lineup—Gary (guitar/vocals), sons Wayne (bass/fiddle/vocals) and Mason (mandolin/bass/vocals), and banjoist Cody Pearman—continues the multi-generational tradition, with past involvement from Gary's father Finley J. Brewer Jr. and grandfather Finley J. 'Pap' Brewer Sr. Their work has Grammy nominations and mainstream recognition, credited with reviving bluegrass alongside artists like Billy Strings.[1][3][6]
