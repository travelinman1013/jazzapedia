## Biography
Barbara Ann Lewis was born on February 9, 1943 (or 1944 per some sources), in Salem or the nearby small town of South Lyon, Michigan, into a musically rich family. Her parents led orchestras—her father on trumpet, her mother and uncle on saxophone—and family gatherings often turned into jam sessions where young Barbara sang. With an aunt who was a music teacher and cousin Sheldon Brooks, a noted songwriter behind hits like 'Some Of These Days' and 'Darktown Strutters' Ball,' music permeated her early life. By age nine, she was playing piano, guitar, and harmonica, writing songs, and performing in local talent shows, though she initially aspired to nursing rather than a music career.[1][2][3]

Discovered by producer Ollie McLaughlin through her father, Lewis recorded her debut single 'My Heart Went Do Dat Da' in 1961 for Karen Records, a local hit reissued on Atlantic, making her the first Michigan artist on the label. Her 1963 breakout 'Hello Stranger,' which she wrote, topped the R&B chart and hit #3 on the Billboard Hot 100, launching her career with a smooth, soulful style blending northern soul and doo-wop, often featuring Hammond organ and self-penned material. She scored further hits like 'Baby I'm Yours' (#11, produced by Bert Berns), 'Make Me Your Baby' (#11), and 'Straighten Up Your Heart' (#43), placing ten songs on the Hot 100 in the 1960s, second only to Aretha Franklin among Michigan female soloists. Albums like 'Hello Stranger' (1963) and sessions at Motown studios with The Andantes and possibly Marvin Gaye defined her peak.[1][2][3]

After moderate later hits like 'Make Me Belong to You' (#28, 1966), Lewis released singles on Atlantic until 1968, then Enterprise (Stax subsidiary) and Reprise, but grew disenchanted with the industry post-divorce. She retired to Michigan in 1971 for a normal life, pursuing college and other jobs, though she performed selectively. Honored with the Rhythm and Blues Foundation's Pioneer Award in 1999, her legacy endures in covers by artists like Queen Latifah and Yvonne Elliman, cementing her influence on R&B and soul.[1][2]
