# Melissa Aldana

## Biography
Melissa Aldana is a Chilean tenor saxophonist and composer born in 1988 in Santiago, Chile, into a family of saxophonists that included her father, Marcos Aldana, and her grandfather.[1][3][5][8] She began playing saxophone at age six under her father's guidance, starting on alto and absorbing the language of Charlie Parker, Cannonball Adderley, Michael Brecker and other bebop and post‑bop masters.[1][3][5] After hearing Sonny Rollins, she switched to tenor saxophone, initially playing her grandfather’s Selmer Mark VI, and by her early teens she was already performing in Santiago jazz clubs.[1][3][6][8] In 2005 pianist Danilo Pérez heard her while touring Chile and invited her to perform at the Panama Jazz Festival and audition for U.S. music schools, leading to her admission to Berklee College of Music on scholarship.[1][2][3][5] At Berklee she studied with Joe Lovano, George Garzone, Greg Osby, Hal Crook, Bill Pierce and others, graduating in 2009 before relocating to New York City to apprentice with tenor legend George Coleman and immerse herself in the city’s jazz scene.[1][4][6]

Aldana released her debut album *Free Fall* in 2010 on Greg Osby’s Inner Circle Music label, followed by *Second Cycle* in 2012.[1][2][3][7] In 2012 she formed Melissa Aldana & Crash Trio with bassist Pablo Menares and drummer Francisco Mela, releasing their self‑titled album on Concord in 2014 as part of a recording deal tied to her historic victory at the 2013 Thelonious Monk International Jazz Saxophone Competition, where at 24 she became the first female instrumentalist, the first South American, and the youngest musician to win the saxophone prize.[1][2][3][6][7][9] The trio’s second album *Back Home* appeared in 2016, and Aldana continued to gain recognition through projects that blended rigorous harmonic exploration with deeply personal narratives, such as her Frida Kahlo–inspired quartet album *Visions*.[1][6] In the early 2020s she signed with Blue Note Records and released *12 Stars* in 2022, earning a Grammy nomination for Best Improvised Jazz Solo for the track “Falling,” while also being named a Rising Star Artist of the Year by *DownBeat* and joining the jazz faculty at New England Conservatory.[1][3][6][7]

Musically, Aldana is noted for her modern post‑bop vocabulary, intricate harmonic lines, and a robust yet introspective tenor sound that reflects both the lineage of Sonny Rollins and the influence of contemporary saxophonists with whom she studied.[3][4][6] Critics and peers highlight her “deeply meditative interpretation of language and vocabulary” and her commitment to developing an individual voice rooted in the acoustic jazz tradition while drawing on her Chilean heritage and broader Latin American artistic references.[3][6][7] Beyond performance, she has become an important presence as an educator and role model, frequently giving masterclasses and workshops and being recognized by institutions such as Jazz at Lincoln Center and the Altazor National Arts Awards of Chile.[1][4][7] Her achievements at a relatively young age—competition wins, major‑label leadership recordings, and teaching positions—have secured her a prominent place among the leading saxophonists of her generation and a visible figure for women and Latin American musicians in contemporary jazz.[1][3][4][6][7]

## Fun Facts
- She initially played alto saxophone but switched to tenor after hearing Sonny Rollins, using a Selmer Mark VI tenor that had belonged to her grandfather.[1][3][5]
- In 2013 she became simultaneously the first female instrumentalist, the first South American musician, and the youngest winner of the Thelonious Monk International Jazz Saxophone Competition for saxophone.[1][2][3][6][7][9]
- Her project *Visions* draws inspiration from the life and work of painter Frida Kahlo, explicitly linking her own experience as a female jazz musician with Kahlo’s struggle for recognition in a male‑dominated art world.[6]
- She has held significant teaching roles, including being appointed to the jazz faculty at the New England Conservatory’s Jazz Studies Department beginning in fall 2021.[7]
