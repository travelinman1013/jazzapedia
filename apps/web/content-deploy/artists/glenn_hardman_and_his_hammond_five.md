## Biography
Glenn Hardman (June 27, 1910) was an American organist, keyboard player, and vocalist known for his work with the Hammond organ in the jazz and big band genres during the late 1930s. Little is documented about his early life, but he emerged in the music scene around 1939, leading Glenn Hardman and His Hammond Five, a group that popularized the Hammond organ in a accessible, popular jazz style akin to contemporaries like Milt Herth and Ethel Smith.[1][2][6]

Hardman's career highlight came in 1939 when he recorded with his Hammond Five, featuring notable jazz musicians such as trumpeter Lee Castle, tenor saxophonist and clarinetist Lester Young, and Hardman himself on Hammond organ. Tracks like 'Exactly Like You,' 'On the Sunny Side of the Street,' 'Upright Organ Blues,' 'Jazz Me Blues,' and 'Who?' captured a swinging, organ-driven sound that bridged jazz improvisation with popular appeal, often performed in a big band-influenced style.[1][3] His association with Count Basie Orchestra members further tied him to the swing era's elite.[1][4]

Hardman's legacy lies in his contribution to the early popularization of the Hammond organ beyond church settings, making it a viable jazz and entertainment instrument during radio broadcasts and recordings. Though not a dominant figure like later organists such as Jimmy Smith or Wild Bill Davis, his work with Basie-affiliated players helped pave the way for the instrument's mass appeal in the 1940s and beyond, with a small but enduring discography.[2]
