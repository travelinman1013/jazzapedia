## Biography
HollyRock is a band originating from New Orleans, Louisiana, embodying the wild spirit of the region's backroads with their self-created genre known as 'Wonky Tonk,' a fusion of electrified country grit, psychedelic elements, raw storytelling, fiery fiddle, searing lead guitar solos, and thundering rhythms. Their music blends honky-tonk barn burners with kaleidoscopic fever dreams, featuring lyrics that delve into heartache, rebellion, and the surreal magic of the South, creating an immersive experience on stage or under open skies. Details on individual members' early lives or specific career milestones prior to their debut remain unavailable from public sources.

The band's self-titled debut album showcases this Wonky Tonk sound through tracks like '200 Miles,' 'Bad Influence,' 'Voodoo Queen,' 'Back Home,' 'Stillwater,' 'Old Pipe Liner,' 'Life Is Fine,' and 'Mr. Lucid Dreamer,' highlighting fiddle-fueled energy, soul-stirring ballads with southern mysticism, and high-energy grooves. They have performed live, including a rendition of 'Baby I Do' on Band In Seattle's Mo' Jam Monday. As pioneers of their genre, HollyRock continues to evolve, with their album positioned as a soundtrack for wanderers seeking a fresh yet familiar Southern vibe; their legacy is still emerging given their low Spotify popularity of 5 and limited documented history.
