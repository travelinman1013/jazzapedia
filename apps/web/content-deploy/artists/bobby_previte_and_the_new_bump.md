## Biography
Bobby Previte, born July 16, 1951, in Niagara Falls, New York, began his musical journey early, making his stage debut at age five singing Elvis Presley's 'Hound Dog' at a local talent show. Initially drawn to music to meet girls, he shifted to drums in his early teens, constructing a makeshift kit from garbage cans, pie plates, and other found objects, forming the cover band Devil’s Disciples—only to be fired from their first gig for not having 'real' drums. He earned a BA in economics from the University at Buffalo, studying percussion there, before moving to New York City in 1979, where he immersed himself in the Downtown scene.[1][2][4][7]

In New York, Previte quickly established himself as a drummer, composer, and bandleader, collaborating with key figures like John Zorn, Wayne Horvitz, and Elliott Sharp, and contributing to Tom Waits' Rain Dogs (1987). His work blends notated and improvised music, drawing from psychedelic rock, R&B, blues, avant-garde percussionists like Sunny Murray, and influences such as Edgard Varèse and Charles Mingus. He led ensembles like The New Bump, releasing Set the Alarm for Monday (2008) on Palmetto Records as a cinematic extension of his Renaissance-inspired Bump bands, and has recorded on labels including Sony, Nonesuch, and RareNoise.[2][3][4]

Previte's legacy spans decades, with collaborations across genres including work with John Adams, Robert Altman, and Iggy Pop. He has taught master classes at institutions like Princeton, Eastman School of Music, and NYU, and continues leading projects like the New Standard trio with Jamie Saft and Steve Swallow, and his new quintet Second Arrow. His enduring impact lies in emancipating percussion as a primary expressive force in creative music.[2][4][6]

## Fun Facts
- At age 13, Previte built his first drum set from a rusted garbage can (bass drum), upside-down trash bins (toms), aluminum pie plates on plungers (cymbals), and a wire coat hanger pedal with a rubber ball—practicing in his dark basement under a spotlight.
- Fired from his first band gig at church for using makeshift drums, he saved paperboy earnings to buy his current professional kit, which he still uses worldwide.
- Encountered Jimi Hendrix in a stalled East Village limo, unfurling a Hendrix poster for a peace sign and smile.
- Created the prominent marimba part for Tom Waits' 'Clap Hands' on Rain Dogs spontaneously during recording, which became the song's signature.
