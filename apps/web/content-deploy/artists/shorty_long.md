## Biography
Frederick Earl 'Shorty' Long was born on May 20, 1940, in Birmingham, Alabama, where he developed his musical talents early on, learning from local figures like Alvin 'Shine' Robinson and W.C. Handy. A multi-instrumentalist proficient on piano, organ, drums, guitar, trumpet, and harmonica, he worked as a DJ, toured with the Ink Spots, and performed at clubs like Old Stables before moving to Detroit in 1959 at age 19 to pursue a recording career.[1][2][3]

In Detroit, Long impressed Harvey Fuqua, recording singles for Fuqua's Tri-Phi label, which was sold to Berry Gordy, bringing Long to Motown. His debut Motown single, 'Devil with the Blue Dress On' (1964), co-written with William 'Mickey' Stevenson, launched the Soul Records imprint but did not chart, though Mitch Ryder's cover became a hit. Long served as MC for Motortown Revue tours, co-wrote tracks like 'Function at the Junction' (1966, #42 R&B) with Eddie Holland, and achieved his biggest success with 'Here Comes the Judge' (#8 Pop, #4 R&B in 1968). Notably, he was one of only two Motown artists—alongside Smokey Robinson—allowed to self-produce in the 1960s, releasing works like 'I Had a Dream' (1969) with Sylvia Moy.[1][2][3][6]

Long's funky, upbeat soul style, blending Motown polish with bluesy grit, earned praise as an unsung hero, but his career was cut short on June 29, 1969, when he drowned at age 29 in the Detroit River during a fishing accident with friend Oscar Williams. Posthumously, Motown released *The Prime of Shorty Long* (1969), and he was inducted into the Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame in 1980, cementing his legacy in northern soul and classic Motown.[1][2][3]
