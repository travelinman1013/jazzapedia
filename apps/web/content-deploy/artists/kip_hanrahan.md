## Biography
Kip Hanrahan, born December 9, 1954, in the Bronx, New York, to an Irish-Jewish family, grew up in a Puerto Rican neighborhood that immersed him in Latin music from an early age. Starting as a teenage percussionist with Eddie Palmieri, he pursued a fellowship in sculpture at Cooper Union before transitioning into music as a percussionist, composer, bandleader, and producer. In the 1970s, he moved to Paris to work on films with Michel Contat, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Jean-Luc Godard, experiences that shaped his view of music production as akin to directing a film.[1][2][3][4][5]

Hanrahan founded American Clavé, where he assembled eclectic ensembles blending avant-garde/free jazz, Latin jazz, rock, blues, and poetry, often centered around the rhythmic clave pulse. He produced key albums like three for Astor Piazzolla, including 'Tango Zero Hour,' and his own releases such as 'Days and Nights of Blue Luck Inverted' (1987), 'Tenderness' (1990), 'Exotica' (1993), and the acclaimed 'All Roads Are Made of the Flesh' (1995), which spans Jelly Roll Morton vignettes to avant-garde works. His role as a 'facilitator' allowed him to connect diverse talents, creating magical, enigmatic recordings with cult status.[1][2][5][9]

By the early 1990s, Hanrahan relocated to Reston, Virginia, sustaining his career through European and Japanese licensing despite U.S. legal issues and limited visibility—he hasn't performed in America since 1999. He continues composing in New York studios, recording extensively, and reinventing his sound with each project, maintaining faith in his music's importance amid a low profile.[2][5]

## Fun Facts
- Hanrahan compares his music production role to that of a film director, stemming from his 1970s Paris work with Jean-Luc Godard, Sartre, and Contat.
- Despite his Bronx Puerto Rican neighborhood roots shaping his Latin music affinity, he insists he's not a 'Latin musician' but grew up learning it alongside locals.
- He once drove a truck to pay bills amid legal disputes with labels like Pangaea, while building success in Europe and Japan.
- In Reston, Virginia, crickets kept him awake the first two summers, preventing composition until he returned to New York studios.
