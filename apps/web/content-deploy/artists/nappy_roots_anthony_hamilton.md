## Biography
Anthony Cornelius Hamilton, born January 28, 1971, in Charlotte, North Carolina, began his musical journey singing in his local church choir at age 10 and continued in the award-winning choir at South Mecklenburg High School under director Mark Setzer.[1][2][3] Encouraged by producer Mark Sparks in 1992, he moved to New York City in 1993, signing with Andre Harrell's Uptown Records (an MCA imprint), where he recorded his debut album *XTC* in 1996, though it was shelved after poor single performance and the label's bankruptcy.[1][2][3] During this period, he wrote songs for artists like Donell Jones and provided background vocals for D'Angelo's Voodoo Tour, honing his raw, soulful style often compared to Bill Withers and Bobby Womack.[1][3]

Hamilton broke into the mainstream in 2002 with his powerful chorus on Nappy Roots' 'Po' Folks' from *Watermelon, Chicken & Gritz*, earning a 2003 Grammy nomination for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration and leading to a deal with Jermaine Dupri's So So Def (Arista).[1][2][3] His 2003 album *Comin' from Where I'm From* went platinum, driven by the hit 'Charlene,' followed by gold-certified *Ain't Nobody Worryin'* (2005) and *The Point of It All* (2008), blending Southern soul, R&B, and hip-hop elements with themes of struggle and resilience.[1][2] Later releases like *Back to Love* (2011), *What I'm Feelin'* (2016), and *Love Is the New Black* (2021) solidified his legacy, alongside acting in *American Gangster* and contributions to soundtracks like *Django Unchained*.[2][4]

Known for his gritty, emotive vocals and neo-soul rooted in Southern hip-hop influences, Hamilton has sold over 50 million albums globally, received multiple Grammy and NAACP Image Award nominations, and performed the National Anthem at the 2019 NBA All-Star Game in Charlotte.[2][4] His career reflects perseverance through label failures, establishing him as a enduring voice in contemporary R&B.
