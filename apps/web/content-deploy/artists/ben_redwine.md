## Biography
Ben Redwine, born and raised in Del City, Oklahoma, earned a bachelor of music education from the University of Oklahoma, a master of music from Louisiana State University, and a doctorate in clarinet performance (with a minor in Latin American music history) from The Catholic University of America. He began his professional career performing with the US Army Band in Atlanta, Georgia, followed by winning an audition with the US Naval Academy Band in Annapolis, Maryland, from which he retired in 2014. After retirement, he served on the faculty at The Catholic University of America teaching clarinet and music education for five years, and later taught music for a year at Southern University in Baton Rouge.[1][2][4]

In 2016, Redwine relocated to the New Orleans area to pursue performance opportunities in the birthplace of jazz, where he became a regular performer with the Louisiana Philharmonic and Baton Rouge Symphony Orchestras. He leads the traditional-style Redwine Jazz Band, focusing on early 20th-century popular music, and in 2023 was appointed Leader of the Dukes of Dixieland, performing six nights weekly and with symphony orchestras. His musical style spans classical and jazz genres equally, with endorsements as a Selmer Paris performing artist, D'Addario performing artist, and Rovner Ambassador; he has presented masterclasses internationally, recorded for labels like Naxos and Mapleshade, and composed music for 1920s silent films.[1][2][3]

Redwine founded RJ Music Group, manufacturing products like Gennusa mouthpieces and the Reed Wizard. He serves as Jazz Coordinator for the Northshore Traditional Music Society, leading monthly jazz jams in Covington, and manages the Crescent City Chamber Society, premiering over 30 new compositions since 1999. He resides on the Northshore of Lake Pontchartrain with his wife Leslie and their chickens, continuing to perform on four continents.[1][3]
