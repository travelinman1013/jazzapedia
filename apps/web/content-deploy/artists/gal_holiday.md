## Biography
Gal Holiday, the stage name of Vanessa Niemann, is an Appalachian-born, Maryland-bred musician who relocated to New Orleans in 1999 and founded Gal Holiday and the Honky Tonk Revue in 2004. Growing up in a musically rich household with both parents as talented musicians, Niemann developed her craft early, experimenting with clarinet and trombone before settling on piano and voice as her primary instruments. After arriving in New Orleans, she initially performed with various groups including The Original Shim Shamettes during the burlesque revival era and later The SophistiCats and SophistiKittens, a surf and bump-n-grind style band. When the latter group decided to go entirely instrumental in 2004, Niemann seized the opportunity to create her own project, drawing inspiration from rockabilly music and older western swing that she was actively listening to at the time.

Gal Holiday and the Honky Tonk Revue emerged at the vanguard of New Orleans' country music scene, a genre that was relatively underdeveloped in the city when the band formed. The band's infectious energy, evocative songwriting, and impeccable musicianship quickly established them as local favorites and helped cultivate an avid fan base of two-steppers worldwide. Despite significant disruption from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, which temporarily altered the band's lineup, the group persevered and continued to evolve their sound. Over the years, they have become multi-time Big Easy and Best of the Beat Award recipients, regularly featured at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival since at least 2009 (appearing on the main Festival Stage by 2022 for their thirteenth consecutive year). Their albums have reached as high as third on the FAR Charts (Freeform American Roots Music) and the top 100 on the AMA Charts (Americana Music Association).

Niemann's powerful voice and magnetic stage presence have earned her the moniker "The Punk Rock Patsy Cline," reflecting her feisty attitude and originality. Her career spans 23 years of professional performance, and she has lent her talent to numerous musical acts both on stage and in the studio. In recognition of her contributions to American music and culture, Vanessa Niemann was honored with an induction into the Hall of Master Folk Artists at the Louisiana Folk Life Center on July 27, 2019.

## Fun Facts
- Niemann was initially drawn to New Orleans to pursue jazz but quickly perceived an oversaturation in the genre, especially for female vocalists, which led her to pivot toward country and honky tonk music—a genre that had virtually no presence in the city when she started her band in 2004.
- She earned the nickname 'The Punk Rock Patsy Cline' due to her feisty attitude and originality, reflecting her unique blend of classic country sensibilities with a rebellious modern edge.
- Before founding Gal Holiday and the Honky Tonk Revue, Niemann worked as a dancer and performer with The Original Shim Shamettes during New Orleans' burlesque revival era and later with The SophistiCats and SophistiKittens, a surf and bump-n-grind style band with go-go dancers.
- Vanessa Niemann was inducted into the Hall of Master Folk Artists at the Louisiana Folk Life Center on July 27, 2019, recognizing her significant contributions to American folk and roots music.
