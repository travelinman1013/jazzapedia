## Biography
Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington were not a formal duo or band, but rather two of the most influential jazz musicians of the 20th century who occasionally collaborated. Louis Armstrong (1901-1971) grew up in poverty in New Orleans, Louisiana, and developed his cornet and trumpet skills while incarcerated at the New Orleans Home for Colored Waifs, where Professor Peter Davis provided his musical training. He was mentored by Joe "King" Oliver and gained experience playing in brass parades, riverboats, and with bands like Fate Marable's orchestra before becoming one of the first jazz musicians to be featured in extended solos, injecting his own personality and creating a unique sound that revolutionized jazz performance. Duke Ellington (1899-1974) grew up in a more stable environment in Washington, D.C., initially showing little interest in music until age fourteen when he began listening to poolroom pianists. He took inspiration from multiple pianists across America and by 1919 met Sonny Greer, who encouraged his professional career. Around 1926, Ellington formed his own orchestra and went on to compose over one thousand compositions, becoming renowned as both a bandleader and pianist who understood the musical skills of every sideman in his ensemble. Both musicians fundamentally transformed jazz from a commodity into a respected art form and became among the first widely known African-American entertainers whose musical genius transcended racial barriers.

## Fun Facts
- Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington recorded only one album together, 'The Great Summit,' despite both being prominent figures in jazz since the 1920s. The collaboration was proposed by Columbia Records producer George Avakian in 1955 but was delayed for years due to Armstrong's manager Joe Glazer's tough negotiations over financial terms.
- During the recording of 'The Great Summit' in April 1961, Armstrong demonstrated remarkable musicianship by quickly grasping the interpretations of Ellington compositions. Jazz historian Dan Morgenstern noted that Armstrong 'seemed to know the Ellington routines better than Barney Bigard,' the clarinetist who had spent fifteen years with Duke before joining Armstrong.
- On 'The Great Summit,' Duke Ellington accompanied Armstrong on piano for the ballad 'I'm Just a Lucky So and So' without additional ensemble backing—a unique example in Ellington's vast discography that showcased his genius as a pianist through his penetrating touch, propulsive chords, and imaginative backgrounds.
- Duke Ellington composed over one thousand compositions during his career, many of which incorporated the blended styles of different musicians in his orchestra. At his Cotton Club engagement in the late 1920s, which lasted 38 months, Ellington rose to a position equal to Louis Armstrong as the leading figure in jazz—Armstrong recognized as the greatest soloist and Ellington as the greatest bandleader and composer.
