## Biography
Allen Rathel Bunn, known as Tarheel Slim, was born on September 24, 1923, in Bailey, North Carolina, where he initially worked in tobacco fields before transitioning to music in the early 1940s. He sang with gospel groups such as the Gospel Four and the Selah Jubilee Singers, providing baritone vocals, second lead, and guitar accompaniment alongside founder Thermon Ruth. In 1949, Bunn and Ruth formed a secular group initially called the Jubilators, which recorded under multiple names in 1950 before settling as The Larks; their hits 'Eyesight to the Blind' (No. 5 R&B, 1951) and 'Little Side Car' (No. 10 R&B, 1951), both led by Bunn, led to tours with Percy Mayfield and Mahalia Jackson. Bunn relocated to New York City in 1950, living there until his death.[1][2][3]

Around 1955, Bunn married Anna Lee Sandford (1935–2004), known as Little Ann, and they began recording as The Lovers for Lamp (Aladdin subsidiary), scoring a hit with Bunn-penned 'Darling It's Wonderful' (No. 15 R&B, No. 48 pop, 1957). Transitioning to Tarheel Slim and Little Ann, they released singles for Fury, Fire, Fury, and Atco into the early 1960s, blending R&B, doo-wop, rockabilly, and blues; notable tracks include 'Wildcat Tamer'/'Number 9 Train' (1958, Fury, featuring Jimmy Spruill) and 'It's Too Late' (No. 20 R&B, 1959, Fire/Checker). Bunn also managed and recorded with groups like the Wheels and Federals. Their career faded after 1963, but Bunn revived solo in the 1970s with acoustic folk-blues albums on Trix Records, drawing from his Carolina roots, until his death from illness on August 21, 1977, at age 53.[1][2][3][4]

Tarheel Slim's versatile style spanned gospel, doo-wop, R&B, pop, rockabilly, and blues, marked by his tremolo guitar and emotive vocals, influencing New York rock 'n' roll and later blues revival scenes. Though commercial success was limited post-1950s, their raw energy and genre-blending earned retrospective acclaim as pinnacles of the era.[1][2]
