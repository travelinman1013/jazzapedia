## Biography
Kermit the Frog, an anthropomorphic green frog Muppet character, was created and originally performed by puppeteer Jim Henson in 1955 on the local Washington, D.C. television series *Sam and Friends*. Initially not explicitly a frog but later refined with flipper-like hands and frog features by 1968, Kermit served as a pragmatic everyman figure, embodying easy-going likability with occasional wiseguy tendencies and natural leadership qualities amid chaotic surroundings.[1][2][6] He gained prominence as a news reporter on *Sesame Street* starting in 1969, bringing a serious perspective to whimsical events, before becoming the frazzled host and stage manager of *The Muppet Show* from 1976 to 1981, where he wrangled zany characters like Fozzie Bear, Gonzo, and Miss Piggy while featuring celebrity guests.[1][2][6]

Kermit's career expanded into films such as *The Muppet Movie* (1979), where he journeys from the swamp to Hollywood inspired by a talent agent's encouragement, singing his signature banjo tune 'Rainbow Connection' and assembling the Muppet troupe.[1][3] Voiced by Henson until his death in 1990, the role passed to Steve Whitmire, with Kermit continuing in movies, TV specials, and as mascot for The Muppets Studio under Disney ownership.[4][6] His musical style aligns with children's music, variety show performances, and folk-inspired songs like those in Muppet productions, emphasizing wholesome entertainment and life lessons.[context][1]

Kermit's legacy endures as the world's most famous Muppet, symbolizing resilience and unity in family entertainment, with appearances across decades cementing his iconic status despite the puppet's evolution through different performers.[1][2][4]
