## Biography
The John Butler Trio was an Australian roots rock and jam band formed in Fremantle, Western Australia, in 1998, led by guitarist and vocalist John Butler, who was born on April 1, 1975, in Torrance, California, to an Australian father and American mother. Butler moved to Pinjarra, Western Australia, at age 11 in 1986, began playing guitar at 16, and started busking in Fremantle by 1996, releasing a self-recorded cassette *Searching for Heritage*. The band initially consisted of Butler, bassist Gavin Shoesmith, and drummer Jason McGann, independently releasing their debut album *John Butler* in December 1998. Their second album *Three* (2001) achieved platinum status and top 30 chart position in Australia, marking the start of their rise with extensive touring.[1][2][4]

The band's career evolved through lineup changes and commercial success, with albums *Sunrise Over Sea* (2004), *Grand National* (2007), and *April Uprising* (2010) all debuting at number one on Australian charts and reaching platinum. They released live albums like *Living 2001–2002* (2003, platinum) and built a strong reputation through tours supporting acts like Dave Matthews Band and John Mayer, performances at festivals such as Bonnaroo and Splendour in the Grass, and independent releases via Jarrah Records, co-owned by Butler, The Waifs, and manager Phil Stevens. Key members over time included drummers Nicky Bomba (2003–2004, 2009–2013), Michael Barker (2004–2009), and Grant Gerathy (2013–2019), and bassists Shannon Birchall (2002–2009) and Byron Luiters (2009–2019).[1][2][4]

The Trio disbanded in 2019 after releasing their final studio album *Home* (2018), having earned critical praise, ARIA awards, and a legacy as one of Australia's most successful independent acts in roots/jam rock, known for eclectic influences blending acoustic folk, reggae, and alternative rock, and a powerful live presence.[1][4][8]
