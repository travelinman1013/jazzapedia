## Biography
Mr Eazi (born Oluwatosin Ajibade) and Chronixx (born Jamar Rolando McNaughton Jr. on October 10, 1992) are two prominent African and Caribbean artists known for their contributions to afrobeats, dancehall, and reggae fusion, with a notable mutual admiration expressed by Mr Eazi in 2019. Mr Eazi, originally from Port Harcourt, Nigeria, relocated to Kumasi, Ghana at age 16 to study mechanical engineering at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST), where he began promoting parties through Swagger Entertainment and recorded his first guest verse on 'My Life,' sparking his music career. He released his debut mixtape *About to Blow* in 2013, followed by *Life Is Eazi, Vol. 1 – Accra to Lagos* in 2017, blending afrobeats and afropop while drawing from Highlife influences; his entrepreneurial background includes ventures in e-commerce, gold mining, and emPawa Africa label.[2][7]

Chronixx, from Spanish Town, Jamaica, was nurtured musically by his father, dancehall artist Chronicle, starting recordings at age 11 with gospel tracks and harmonies for artists like Lutan Fyah. At 14, he produced riddims like the 'Freezer Riddim' for Konshens and Popcaan; tragedies including his brother's death in 2009 and collaborator Alty 'J.O.E' Nunes' passing in 2011 fueled his rise, leading to hits like 'Smile Jamaica' and the EP *Dread & Terrible* (2014), which topped Billboard's Top Reggae Albums. He founded ZincFence Recordz with Romain 'Teflon' Arnett.[1][3][6]

Their musical styles—Mr Eazi's afrobeats/afropop and Chronixx's roots reggae/dancehall—intersect in genre overlaps like afroswing and dancehall per Spotify data, with Mr Eazi citing Chronixx as an inspiration for potential Caribbean-leaning projects post-*Lagos to London* (2018), though no direct collaboration is documented in available sources.[4]
