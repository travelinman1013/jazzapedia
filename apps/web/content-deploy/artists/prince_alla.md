## Biography
Prince Alla, born Keith Lorenzo Blake on May 10, 1950, in St. Elizabeth, Jamaica, is a pioneering roots reggae vocalist dubbed "The Gentle Giant" for his warm demeanor and irrepressible character.[1][2] He grew up in Greenwich Town and Denham Town in West Kingston, where he began his musical journey in the late 1960s as part of the vocal group The Leaders alongside Milton Henry and Roy "Soft" Palmer, with producer Joe Gibbs overseeing their early rocksteady recordings at Federal Recording Company.[1][2] Before fully committing to reggae, Prince Alla spent significant time at Prince Emmanuel Edwards' Bobo Hill camp in Bull Bay during the late 1960s, where he immersed himself in Rastafari spirituality and livity, learning hymns and spiritual practices that would profoundly shape his artistic vision.[1][2]

Prince Alla's most impactful work emerged in the mid-1970s after his spiritual awakening, when he returned to music with a commitment to righteous roots reggae.[1] Working primarily with producers Bertram Brown (Freedom Sounds label) and Tappa Zukie, he recorded definitive classics including "City Without Pity," "Bucket Bottom," "Stone" (mixed by King Tubby), "Bosrah," and "Nah Go a Funeral" (with Joe Gibbs).[1] He frequently collaborated with the Soul Syndicate Band to realize his musical vision, and released his debut LP "Heaven is My Roof" in 1978.[1] His lyrical approach characteristically placed Old Testament biblical stories within the context of societal injustice in Jamaica and globally, creating a distinctive fusion of spiritual conviction and social commentary.[2]

Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Prince Alla maintained steady output while addressing political and social issues through his music, and successfully adapted to the digital music era without losing his audience.[1] By the early 2000s, he experienced a resurgence as a new generation discovered his work through reissued classic albums, establishing him as a pioneering figure in roots reggae.[1] As of 2024, Prince Alla's legacy remains firmly established, with his contributions inspiring countless artists and his music continuing to resonate across generations through international touring, festival performances, and ongoing recordings.[1]

## Fun Facts
- Prince Alla's father initially disapproved of his Rastafarian path, telling him he couldn't stay at home if he continued to 'Ras up' his hair, which prompted the young musician to leave and eventually pursue music full-time.[2]
- He deliberately avoided recording with certain legendary producers: he refused to work with Duke Reid because Reid was a retired policeman known for firing guns in the air and disliking Rastafarians, and avoided Studio 1 due to rumors of mistreatment of artists like Delroy Wilson.[2]
- During the politically violent mid-1970s in West Kingston, Rastafarians like Prince Alla enjoyed a unique status where they could pass through both PNP and JLP political meetings without trouble, as they were not yet involved in partisan politics.[2]
- Despite his international success and touring across Europe and North America, Prince Alla has remained humbly rooted in West Kingston, living in the same area since his youth.[1][2]
