## Biography
Karen Lee Orzolek, known professionally as Karen O, was born on November 22, 1978, in South Korea to a Polish-American father and Korean mother, before moving to the United States. She rose to prominence as the lead vocalist of the indie rock band Yeah Yeah Yeahs, formed in 2000 in New York City, becoming a key figure in the 2000s garage rock and post-punk revival through her energetic performances and eccentric fashion style.[1][4] The band's albums, including Fever to Tell (2003), Show Your Bones (2006), It's Blitz! (2009), Mosquito (2013), and Cool It Down (2022), established her reputation, earning five Grammy nominations collectively.[1]

In her solo career, Karen O released Crush Songs in 2014 and notably collaborated with producer Danger Mouse on the album Lux Prima, released on March 15, 2019. The duo first met in 2007 as mutual admirers but began working together in 2016 due to scheduling conflicts, blending her tender, fiery vocals with Danger Mouse's experimental production in a style that fused indie rock, psychedelia, and soulful elements.[1] She has also composed for films, earning an Academy Award nomination for 'The Moon Song' from Her (2013) and multiple nods for work on Where the Wild Things Are (2009), directed by her then-partner Spike Jonze.[1]

Karen O's legacy includes Grammy nominations for her solo work, such as Best Rock Performance for 'Woman' with Danger Mouse in 2020, and recognition from Rolling Stone as one of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time in 2023. Her contributions extend to soundtracks, video games like Rise of the Tomb Raider ('I Shall Rise'), and collaborations with artists across genres, solidifying her influence in indie and alternative music.[1]
