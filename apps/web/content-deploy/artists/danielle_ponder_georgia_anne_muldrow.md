## Biography
**Danielle Ponder** (born 1982, Rochester, New York) grew up in a musical household where her father frequently played instruments and sang, inspiring her early interest in music; as a teenager, he gifted her her first guitar.[2] After college, she pursued law at Northeastern University School of Law, earning a Juris Doctor in 2011, and worked as a public defender in Monroe County, motivated by her brother's 20-year sentence under a 'three strikes' law; she later served as a diversity, equity, and inclusion officer while occasionally touring Europe and performing.[2][3] In December 2021, Ponder left her legal career to focus on music full-time, releasing her debut album *Some of Us Are Brave* in 2022—a soul, R&B, and trip hop blend honoring Black women, inspired by the book *All the Women are White, All the Blacks are Men: But Some of Us Are Brave*.[2][3][4]

Her career gained momentum with TV appearances on *Late Night with Seth Meyers* (2022), *Jimmy Kimmel Live!*, *CBS Saturday Morning*, and *General Hospital* (2023), plus a Lollapalooza performance; the 2023 deluxe edition added live tracks, a demo, new single 'Roll the Credits' (later in Apple iPhone 16 ads and *Dragon Age: Veilguard* credits), and a remix by **Georgia Anne Muldrow**.[2][3] Ponder's style mixes alternative soul and hip hop, addressing Black experiences and heartbreak with funky, malleable beats.[3]

**Georgia Anne Muldrow** (born 1983, Los Angeles) was raised by jazz guitarist father Ronald Muldrow and singer mother Rickie Byars in a musical family.[1] She debuted with the 2006 EP *Worthnothings* and album *Olesi: Fragments of an Earth* on Stones Throw Records, co-founded SomeOthaShip Connect in 2008 with ex-husband Dudley Perkins, and released key works like *Seeds* (2012, produced by Madlib) and *Overload* (2018, Brainfeeder).[1] Known for soul and hip hop as singer, producer, and songwriter, her style draws comparisons to Roberta Flack, Nina Simone, and Ella Fitzgerald; she has remixed for Ponder and collaborated widely.[1][2]
