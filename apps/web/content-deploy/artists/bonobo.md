## Biography
Simon Green, known professionally as Bonobo, was born on 30 March 1976 in rural Hampshire, England, into a musically inclined family where his parents were involved in the English folk scene.[4] As a teenager, Green experimented with various musical styles, from garage rock with friends to sample-based hip-hop inspired by artists like A Tribe Called Quest and the Native Tongues collective.[4] His early musical education began when his school's music department allowed him to borrow a 4-track cassette recorder during summer holidays, an experience he describes as "mind-blowing" for its ability to layer multiple recordings.[4] At eighteen, he relocated to Brighton, where he immersed himself in the city's vibrant jazz, hip-hop, funk, and soul scene centered around label nights like Phonic:hoop and mentorship from Rob Luis of Tru Thoughts.[1][2]

Green's professional career launched in 1999 when his track "Terrapin" appeared on the Tru Thoughts compilation "When Shapes Join Together," followed by his self-produced debut album "Animal Magic" in 2000, which announced him as a serious talent capable of blending live instrumentation with electronic production.[1][2] After signing to Ninja Tune in 2003, he released "Dial 'M' For Monkey," marking a shift toward live instrumentation and elastic basslines, and established himself as both a prolific studio producer and accomplished DJ.[1][4] His breakthrough came with the 2010 album "Black Sands," which became a cult classic and led to extensive touring, including sold-out performances at venues like the Sydney Opera House and Brixton Academy.[3] By the time of his sixth studio album "Migration" in 2017—released following the deaths of both his parents—Green had become a three-time Grammy nominee with over 1,150 recorded shows across three continents and 30 countries, his 2017 Migration tour alone selling two million tickets.[3][4]

Bonobo's musical evolution reflects his willingness to experiment across genres while maintaining a distinctive aesthetic that fuses organic instrumentation with electronic production.[3][6] His work incorporates elements of trip-hop, downtempo, nu jazz, and world music, performed live by a full orchestrated band that reimagines his studio recordings.[6] In 2020, during pandemic lockdowns in Los Angeles, Green experienced creative stagnation until experimenting with modular synthesizers—an unfamiliar territory that reignited his artistic drive and led to his seventh studio album "Fragments."[4] Throughout his career spanning more than two decades, Green has maintained a practice of writing new music while touring and has become known for his meticulous approach to production and his ability to translate intricate electronic compositions into compelling live performances.

## Fun Facts
- Green's early creative breakthrough came from borrowing a 4-track cassette recorder from his school's music department during summer holidays as a child, where he discovered the joy of layering multiple recordings of himself—a technique that would later define his production approach with samplers and electronic equipment.[4]
- Before becoming an electronic music pioneer, Green and his teenage friends 'smashed around in a garage playing punky, shouty music' with drum kits and guitars, influenced by bands like The Smashing Pumpkins and Beastie Boys, a phase he describes as early musical education.[4]
- Bonobo's 2017 Migration tour was so successful it sold two million tickets, and the album was created during a period of profound personal grief following the deaths of both his parents, with Green using music-making as a form of escapism and emotional processing.[4]
- During the 2020 pandemic lockdown in Los Angeles, Green experienced complete creative stagnation until he began experimenting with modular synthesizers—an unfamiliar technology that paradoxically reignited his creativity just as the world was reopening.[4]
