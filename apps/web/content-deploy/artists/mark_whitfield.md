## Biography
Mark Whitfield is an American hard bop and soul-jazz guitarist born circa 1967 in the New York area (sources cite both Lindenhurst and Syosset).[2][7] He graduated from Boston's prestigious Berklee College of Music in 1987, where he studied composition, arranging, and all styles of guitar performance.[3][6] His early musical influences included George Benson, a famed soul jazz guitarist whose seamless blend of straight-ahead jazz, smooth jazz, and contemporary R&B served as a foundation for Whitfield's own artistic development.[1]

After returning to New York following his graduation, Whitfield quickly established himself as a rising star in the jazz world. Under the mentorship of George Benson and with connections to organist Jack McDuff, he launched his professional career and began collaborating with legendary artists including Dizzy Gillespie, Art Blakey, Quincy Jones, Ray Charles, Herbie Hancock, and many others.[1][3] In 1990, the New York Times dubbed him "The Best Young Guitarist in the Business," and that same year Warner Bros. released his debut album "The Marksman," which received widespread critical acclaim.[2][3] Time Magazine's Critics' Voices praised the then-24-year-old as "prodigiously gifted" with "a mellow, bluesy swing."[1]

Whitfield's career has flourished over more than three decades, producing a total of 16 solo recordings and numerous collaborative projects.[1][3] He has worked as a bandleader for both Verve and Warner Bros. Records and has collaborated with contemporary artists including Sting, Steven Tyler, John Mayer, Christian McBride, D'Angelo, Mary J. Blige, and Chaka Khan.[1][3][5] His contributions to music earned him a 2022 Grammy Award for "Best Large Jazz Ensemble" for his work with Joey DeFramesco in the Christian McBride Big Band album.[1]
