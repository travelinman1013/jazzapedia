## Biography
Kenny Barron, born in 1943 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, began playing professionally as a teenager with Mel Melvin's orchestra alongside his brother Bill Barron. His career advanced significantly in 1962 when Dizzy Gillespie invited him to join his group on the recommendation of James Moody, replacing Lalo Schifrin and staying until 1966, which deepened his appreciation for be-bop and Latin music. In the late 1970s, he played in the Ron Carter Quartet with Buster Williams and Ben Riley, forming the Kenny Barron Trio in 1980. That year, he co-founded Sphere, a quartet tributing Thelonious Monk with Charlie Rouse, Williams, and Riley, recording eight albums from 1982 to 1988. Barron's style blends suave be-bop filigree, bluesy phrasing, and innovative melodic twists, as noted by critics, and he collaborated extensively with Stan Getz from 1986 to 1991, including the Grammy-nominated People Time.

Dave Holland, born October 1, 1946, in England, started as a bassist in London's jazz scene at age 20, playing at Ronnie Scott's with legends like Coleman Hawkins and Ben Webster, and with British musicians including John McLaughlin. He joined Miles Davis in 1968, contributing to recordings until 1970, then launched his solo career with Conference of the Birds in 1973 on ECM, forming key ties with Anthony Braxton and Sam Rivers. In the 1980s, Holland led quintets with Steve Coleman and Kenny Wheeler, releasing albums like Jumpin' In and Seeds of Time, and formed trios and quartets including Extensions with Coleman and Kevin Eubanks. Known for his compositional prowess and bandleading, Holland won Grammys for his Big Band albums What Goes Around (2002) and Overtime (2005).

The Kenny Barron & Dave Holland Trio emerged from their successful 2014 duo album The Art of Conversation on Impulse! Records, followed by tours and expansions to a trio featuring drummer Johnathan Blake, as in Without Deception (2020) on Dare2. Their partnership highlights masterful interplay in jazz ballads and mainstream jazz, mesmerizing audiences with elegant playing, sensitive melodies, and infectious rhythms, cementing their legacy as jazz masters.
