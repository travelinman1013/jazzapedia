## Biography
Danny Grissett, born in 1975 in Los Angeles, California, began playing piano at age five and started formal classical studies at six. He earned a B.A. in Music Education from Cal State University Dominguez Hills in 1998 and an M.F.A. in Jazz Keyboard Performance from Cal Arts in 2000, followed by studies at the prestigious Thelonious Monk Institute with masters including Barry Harris, Herbie Hancock, Terence Blanchard, Kenny Barron, and Roy Haynes.[1][2][6] After moving to New York, he became a sought-after sideman, collaborating with luminaries like Vincent Herring, Nicholas Payton, Jeremy Pelt, Vanessa Rubin, and especially Tom Harrell, with whom he has worked for over 16 years on seven of Harrell's last 12 releases.[1][2][4]

Grissett launched his solo career in 2006 with the critically acclaimed debut album *Promise* on Criss Cross Jazz, followed by six more recordings over the next decade, balancing trio tours with sideman work alongside Benny Golson, Louis Hayes, Lenny White, Buster Williams, Marcus Strickland, and Jimmy Greene.[1][2][3] Renowned for his technical brilliance, soulful touch, and seamless blend of modern innovation with jazz tradition, he has maintained an international performance schedule while establishing himself as an educator, serving as adjunct faculty at New School University, guest lecturer at Eastman School of Music, and currently on faculty at Jam Music Lab University in Vienna.[2] His latest album *Remembrance* on Savant received 4 out of 5 stars from Downbeat Magazine.[2]

Grissett's legacy endures as a defining figure on the New York and global jazz scenes for over 20 years, celebrated for evocative compositions, interactive trio leadership—often with Vicente Archer on bass across all seven leader recordings—and performances at venues like Teatro La Fenice and Ronnie Scott's.[2][4][9]
