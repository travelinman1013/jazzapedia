## Biography
Seth Walker grew up on a commune in rural North Carolina as the son of classically trained musicians, where he initially played cello before discovering the guitar in his 20s. His introduction to blues came through his Uncle Landon Walker, a musician and disc jockey, igniting a passion for artists like T-Bone Walker, Snooks Eaglin, and B.B. King, which shifted his musical path decisively.[1][2][3][4][5] After living in Austin, New Orleans, Nashville, and settling in Asheville, NC (with some sources noting time split between New Orleans and New York City earlier), he absorbed diverse musical influences from these locales, blending blues traditions with contemporary songwriting.[1][2][3][7]

Walker has released at least 10-12 albums since 1997, achieving Top 20 spots on Americana Radio Charts, No. 2 on the Billboard Blues Album Chart, and praise from NPR, American Songwriter, No Depression, Relix, and Blues Revue. His style fuses blues, gospel, pop, R&B, rock, soul, jazz, roots, and country, delivered with a rich, Southern-inflected voice and skilled guitar work, often compared to Ray Charles, Delbert McClinton, and Percy Mayfield.[1][2][3][4][6] Recent works include 'Are You Open' and 'Gotta Get Back' produced by Jano Rix of The Wood Brothers, 'Why The Worry' (his 12th album in 2025), and singles like 'We Got This' and a Van Morrison cover.[1][3][5]

A prolific touring artist, Walker has opened for The Mavericks, The Wood Brothers, Raul Malo, Paul Thorn, Ruthie Foster, Marc Broussard, Robert Plant, and Zac Brown Band, while maintaining a reputation as a modern Americana and blues figure with global performances.[1][2][3][8]
