## Biography
Manolo Sanlúcar, born Manuel Muñoz Alcón on November 24, 1943, in Sanlúcar de Barrameda near Cádiz, Spain, grew up in a flamenco family; his father, Isidro Muñoz, was a guitarist who played with legends like Pepe Marchena. Taught initially by his father, Sanlúcar began performing professionally at age 12 or 13, winning local competitions and accompanying major artists such as Pepe Marchena, Pepe Pinto, La Niña de los Peines, and La Paquera de Jerez. He studied with renowned maestro Javier Molina, traveling by bicycle to Jerez de la Frontera for lessons, and immersed himself in the local flamenco scene despite limited mobility in that era.

By his late teens, Sanlúcar adopted his hometown as his stage name and shifted from accompaniment to solo performance and composition, recognizing the guitar's untapped potential. In the 1970s, amid Spain's cultural transitions, he pioneered flamenco's evolution by enriching its harmonies, blending it with symphonic elements, pop, and classical influences like Joaquín Rodrigo. Key works include the album *Sanlúcar* (1974) with tracks like 'Caballo Negro,' *Fantasía para Guitarra y Orquesta* (1978), *Tauromagia*, *Trebujena*, *Medea* (a global ballet success), *Soleá*, and the flamenco opera *Ven y Sígueme* (1982) featuring El Lebrijano and Rocío Jurado. His style emphasized virtuosity, clean sound, and innovation while rooted in tradition.[1][2][3][4][5]

Regarded alongside Paco de Lucía, Tomatito, and Vicente Amigo as a pillar of modern flamenco guitar, Sanlúcar was also a teacher whose students elevated the art form. He passed away on August 27, 2022, at age 78 in Jerez Hospital, leaving a legacy of over 20 albums and worldwide performances that dignified and expanded flamenco guitar.[1][2][5]
