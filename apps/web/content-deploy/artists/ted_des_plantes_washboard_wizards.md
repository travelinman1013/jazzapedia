## Biography
Ted des Plantes' Washboard Wizards was a studio band formed by Ohio-based multi-instrumentalist Ted des Plantes and Bob Erdos, driven by their shared interest in composer Clarence Williams. The group specialized in traditional jazz and ragtime, drawing inspiration from Williams' 1920s and 1930s recordings that prominently featured washboards. They never performed live, instead releasing seven albums for Stomp Off Records over more than twenty years, with their debut *Shout, Sister, Shout!* (1987) focusing exclusively on Williams' material.[1][2][5]

Ted des Plantes, the band's leader, began his professional career playing tuba in Germany in 1968 while serving in the military, evolving through drums to become best known on piano in pre-bebop stride style. With over 50 years in traditional jazz, he recorded extensively for labels like Stomp Off and Jazzology as a leader and sideman in groups such as Powers’ Hot Four, Chicago Rhythm, and the Washboard Wizards. In recent years, he launched TdP Productions to reissue rare recordings, including the Wizards' obscured debut LP now available on CD.[1][4]

The Wizards' musical style emphasized washboard rhythms—played by Hal Smith—alongside reeds, cornet, banjo, and piano, capturing the spirited, improvised essence of early jazz. Albums like *Thumpin' and Bumpin'* and *Midnight Stomp* highlight their dedication to historical repertoire, contributing to the preservation of traditional jazz through studio precision rather than live performance.[1][3][5]
