## Biography
Lauren Murphy, born in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, was raised in the culturally rich environment of New Orleans and south Louisiana, where she immersed herself in diverse musical traditions including Southern Roots Music, Cajun French influences, Latin Jazz, and gospel work songs. A classically trained musician with 17 years of formal training and 18 years of intensive dance, she studied at LSU under notable figures like Andrei Codrescu, Maya Angelou, and Barry Kyle. At age 16, she performed with the New York Philharmonic at Carnegie Hall, singing Jon Rutter's 'Requiem,' an experience that left a lasting impact. In the mid-1990s, she relocated to Northern California to advance her career, becoming a respected figure in the rock and roll scene.[1][2][5]

Murphy's career flourished in the San Francisco Bay Area, where she gained prominence as a background vocalist for the band Zero, featuring Steve Kimock, Robert Hunter, and her late husband, Judge Murphy. She served as band leader and main composer for Lansdale Station (2005-2013), an award-winning act with Judge. Described as 'Lady Willpower' by Relix Magazine, her powerful, brassy vocals draw comparisons to Janis Joplin, Grace Slick, Patty Griffin, Emmylou Harris, Joni Mitchell, and Joan Baez. Her style blends Songbird/Singer-Songwriter acoustic with folk rock, Western Country Blues, and storytelling rooted in her Louisiana heritage. After Judge's death in 2013 from cancer and organ transplant rejection, followed by her father's suicide and the 2021 loss of her drummer, she retreated but later revived her career, touring from New Orleans to San Francisco and releasing new music, including a single with Louis Michot.[1][2]

Currently based in Madisonville, Louisiana, in a 125-year-old home, Murphy leads Lauren Murphy & The Psychedelics, fusing southern roots with classic San Francisco sound. She has performed at prestigious venues like the Great American Music Hall for Zero's 25th Anniversary and the Frank Brown International Songwriters Festival. Her music airs on mainstream and public radio worldwide, and she continues recording with top producers while maintaining a legacy as an iconic singer in Northern and Central California, now extending back to her Gulf Coast roots.[1][2]
