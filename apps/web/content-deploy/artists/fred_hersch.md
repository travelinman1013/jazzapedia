## Biography
Fred Hersch was born on October 21, 1955, and grew up in North Avondale, Cincinnati, Ohio, where he developed into a child prodigy at the piano. He first became interested in jazz while attending Grinnell College in Iowa, eventually dropping out to pursue music professionally in Cincinnati, where he became immersed in the city's close-knit jazz scene during his late teens. He continued his formal studies at the New England Conservatory under pianist Jaki Byard, where he attracted significant press attention. A pivotal moment in his early career came when bandleader Art Pepper invited him to sit in at a jazz club in Dayton, Ohio—an opportunity that essentially launched his professional trajectory.

After moving to New York in 1977, Hersch established himself as a versatile and innovative pianist through collaborations with artists including Art Farmer, Jane Ira Bloom, Toots Thielemans, and Eddie Daniels throughout the 1980s. He released his first solo piano recording in 1993 and went on to become the first artist in the 75-year history of the Village Vanguard to play weeklong engagements as a solo pianist, beginning in 2006. Over more than three decades, Hersch has recorded more than 75 original compositions across more than 40 albums as a bandleader or solo artist, earning 17 Grammy nominations and establishing himself as one of the most prolific and celebrated solo jazz pianists of his generation.

Hersch is widely recognized for his ability to reinvent the standard jazz repertoire while creating a distinctive body of original works, combining extraordinary technique with keen insight and fresh ideas. Beyond his performing career, he has been a committed educator at institutions including the New England Conservatory, Juilliard School, The New School, Manhattan School of Music, and Rutgers University, profoundly influencing a new generation of jazz pianists. His work has been described by The New York Times as demonstrating "rare imaginative power," and he has received numerous honors including a 2003 Guggenheim Memorial Fellowship for composition and residencies at prestigious institutions like MacDowell and Bellagio.

## Fun Facts
- Hersch's career was essentially launched by a spontaneous opportunity when Art Pepper kicked the hired pianist off the stand at a jazz club in Dayton, Ohio, and asked if anyone in the audience could sit in—Hersch accepted and performed, setting his professional path in motion.
- In 2008, Hersch experienced a two-month coma, during which he had vivid visions that later inspired his evening-length multimedia collaboration 'My Coma Dreams' with writer/director Herschel Garfein, featuring 11 instrumentalists and an actor/singer, which was captured on video at Columbia University.
- Hersch was the first artist in the 75-year history of the Village Vanguard to play weeklong engagements as a solo pianist, a groundbreaking achievement that established him as a pioneering force in solo jazz piano performance.
- His 2017 autobiography, 'Good Things Happen Slowly: A Life In and Out of Jazz,' provides intimate insights into his life and career, including his early experiences in the Cincinnati jazz scene and his journey to becoming one of jazz's most influential pianists.
