## Biography
Gladys Knight and the Pips were an American R&B, soul, and funk family music group from Atlanta, Georgia, that originated in the early 1950s.[3] The group was founded by Gladys Knight, her brother Merald "Bubba" Knight, sister Brenda Knight, and cousins Eleanor Guest and William Guest, initially performing under the name "The Pips," derived from the nickname of their cousin James "Pip" Woods.[3] After signing with Brunswick Records in 1957 and releasing unsuccessful singles, the group underwent lineup changes, with Brenda Knight and Eleanor Guest replaced by cousin Edward Patten and Langston George in 1959.[3] This lineup produced their first charting hit, "Every Beat of My Heart" in 1961, after which they officially adopted the name Gladys Knight and the Pips.[1][3]

The group achieved major commercial success after signing with Motown Records in 1966, where they were paired with songwriter and producer Norman Whitfield.[1] Their breakthrough came in 1967 with "I Heard It Through the Grapevine," which sold 2.5 million records and reached number one on the R&B charts and number two on the pop charts.[4] Throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s, they released numerous hit singles including "Nitty Gritty," "Friendship Train," "If I Were Your Woman," and "Neither One of Us (Wants to Be the First to Say Goodbye)," which became their first number-one crossover hit and won a Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Performance in 1973.[1][3] After leaving Motown for Buddah Records in 1973, the group continued their success with a smoother, more accessible sound, achieving their signature number-one hit "Midnight Train to Georgia" and the Grammy-winning single "Love Overboard."[1][3]

Gladys Knight and the Pips disbanded in 1989 after a 37-year tenure, with Gladys Knight embarking on a successful solo career in gospel and R&B music while also pursuing acting opportunities.[2][3] The group was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1996.[2] Gladys Knight became known as the "Empress of Soul" for her distinctive raspy voice and compelling stage presence, and the group's legacy remains influential in soul and R&B music history.[1][2]

## Fun Facts
- Gladys Knight left the Pips in 1962 to start a family with musician Jimmy Newman, during which time the remaining Pips continued performing with little success while Knight performed solo with Newman as her musical director.[3]
- According to Knight's autobiography, Diana Ross had the group removed from being The Supremes' opening act on a 1968 tour because, in Knight's words, they were 'too good.'[3]
- "Neither One of Us (Wants to Be the First to Say Goodbye)" became the Pips' biggest-selling single at Motown, and ironically, it was their last Motown single before the group left the label for Buddah Records in 1973.[1][3]
- Gladys Knight recorded the title song for the James Bond film "Licence to Kill" in 1989, the same year she left the Pips to pursue her solo career.[1]
