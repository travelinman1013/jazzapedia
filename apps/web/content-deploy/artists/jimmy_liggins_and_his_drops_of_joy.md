## Biography
Jimmy Liggins, born James L. Elliott on October 14, 1918, began his career as a professional boxer under the name 'Kid Zulu' until age 18, then worked as a driver for his brother Joe Liggins' band, the Honeydrippers, which inspired him to enter music. Self-taught on guitar, he formed Jimmy Liggins and His Drops of Joy in 1946, signing with Specialty Records in 1947 under Art Rupe. His raw, rocking boogie-woogie and jump blues style contrasted with his brother's smoother swing, yielding hits like 'Cadillac Boogie' (1947), a precursor to 'Rocket 88,' 'Teardrop Blues' (#7 R&B, 1948), 'Careful Love' (#15, 1949), 'Don't Put Me Down' (#9, 1949), and 'Drunk' (#1, 1953).[1][2][3][6][7]

Liggins left Specialty in 1954, recording 'I Ain't Drunk' (covered by Albert Collins) for Aladdin, then launched his own Duplex Records in 1958 (or late 1950s per some sources), releasing singles like 'Ada from Decatur' (1960) until the late 1970s. Known for wild stage antics and manic delivery, he influenced early rock 'n' roll while running a record shop, studio, and nightclub in Durham, North Carolina, where he settled. He oversaw a 1981 reissue of his hits on Route 66 before dying on July 21, 1983, at age 64.[1][2][3][4][6]

His music bridged R&B, jump blues, and boogie-woogie, pioneering rock elements with electrifying performances, though less commercially successful than Joe, Jimmy's primitive energy left a lasting mark on the genre's evolution.
