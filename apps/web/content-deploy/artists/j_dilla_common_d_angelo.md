## Biography
James Dewitt Yancey, better known as J Dilla or Jay Dee, was born on February 7, 1974, in Detroit, Michigan, and emerged from the city's underground hip-hop scene in the mid-1990s. Growing up in the Conant Gardens neighborhood, he began producing beats as a teenager, forming groups like 1st Down with MC Phat Kat in 1995—the first Detroit hip-hop act to sign with a major label—and later co-founding Slum Village in 1996 with friends T3 and Baatin. His early work under the Ummah collective with Q-Tip and Ali Shaheed Muhammad included productions for artists like The Pharcyde, De La Soul, and Busta Rhymes, honing his signature style of lengthy, melodic loops, off-kilter drum breaks, and soulful samples that elevated instrumental hip-hop's complexity.[1][3]

Dilla's career exploded in the early 2000s as a founding member of the Soulquarians collective alongside Questlove, D'Angelo, and others, contributing to landmark albums like Common's Like Water for Chocolate (2000), which he heavily produced, and Erykah Badu's Mama's Gun. He released his solo debut Welcome 2 Detroit in 2001, adopted the J Dilla moniker to avoid confusion with Jermaine Dupri, and collaborated with Madlib as Jaylib on Champion Sound (2003). Despite health struggles from TTP and lupus, he crafted masterpieces like Donuts (2006) from his hospital bed before his death on February 10, 2006, at age 32. His innovative 'Dilla time'—a swung, humanized drum feel—revolutionized hip-hop production and influenced genres from pop to jazz.[1][2]

J Dilla's legacy endures as one of hip-hop's most influential producers, raising Detroit's artistic standards and inspiring generations with his raw, soulful sound. Posthumous releases like The Shining (2006) and The Diary (2016) cemented his canon, while books like Dilla Time detail his transformative impact comparable to Louis Armstrong or James Brown.[1][2]
