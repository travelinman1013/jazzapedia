## Biography
Władziu Valentino Liberace was born on May 16, 1919, in West Allis, Wisconsin, to parents of Italian and Polish origin. He displayed prodigious musical talent from a young age, performing as a soloist with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra at 16 and participating in classical music competitions where he was praised for his flair and showmanship. Growing up in West Milwaukee, he initially pursued classical piano but shifted in the early 1940s to blend pop standards with classical elements, dubbing it 'classical music with the boring parts left out,' to sustain a living in nightclubs and theaters under aliases like Walter Busterkeys.

Liberace's career exploded in the 1950s with his flamboyant Las Vegas residencies, extravagant costumes, ornate pianos, and signature candelabra, making him the world's highest-paid entertainer through the 1970s via international tours, records, television, and films. His breakthrough TV show, The Liberace Show (1952–55, 1969), achieved massive ratings and propelled album sales exceeding 400,000 by 1954 on labels like Columbia. Despite a career slump post-1957 and health scares like near-fatal kidney failure in 1963, he rebuilt through fan-focused appearances, though his 1955 film Sincerely Yours shook his Hollywood ambitions. His style fused classical training with pop accessibility and unparalleled showmanship.

Liberace's legacy endures as 'Mr. Showmanship,' with the Liberace Museum in Las Vegas drawing half a million visitors annually under his brother George's direction. He amassed two Emmy Awards, six gold albums, two Hollywood Walk of Fame stars, and 56 sold-out Radio City Music Hall shows over five decades. He died on February 4, 1987, at his Palm Springs home from AIDS-related pneumonia, confirmed by autopsy despite initial denials.
