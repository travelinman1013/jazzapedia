## Biography
Donna the Buffalo is an Americana band formed in 1988 in Trumansburg, New York, by Tara Nevins and Jeb Puryear, who remain the core and only original members still with the group. Emerging from the old-time fiddle and Appalachian music scene, Nevins (vocals, accordion, fiddle, guitar) and Puryear (vocals, guitar, pedal steel, fiddle, bass) began writing original songs before the Americana genre was formally recognized, blending jam band, newgrass, bluegrass, and Americana styles. The band originated from childhood friends in groups like the Bubba George String Band, which Puryear formed as a kid playing fiddle at age 7 alongside his brother Jordan and friends Richie Stearns and Shane Lamphier; they needed a name for a gig at Cabbagetown Café in Ithaca, where 'Dawn of the Buffalo' was misheard as 'Donna the Buffalo' during a brainstorming session.[1][2][3][4][6]

The band's career developed through relentless touring—over 100 shows annually—and a grassroots ethos, recording 11 albums including the self-titled 'Purple CD' (1993), 'The Ones You Love,' 'Rockin' in the Weary Land' (1999, which won an Association for Independent Music Award for Best Rock Album), and 'Positive Friction' (2000) on Sugar Hill Records. In 1991, they launched the Finger Lakes GrassRoots Festival of Music & Dance in Trumansburg as an AIDS benefit, which grew to attract 12,000-15,000 attendees annually and supports arts and education; they later founded Shakori Hills Grassroots Festival (2003, bi-annual in Pittsboro, NC) and Virginia Key festival (ended after 10 years).[1][2][4][5][6] Lineups evolved with musicians like Jim Miller (original), David McCracken (keyboardist for 15 years), Jed Greenberg (bass/fiddle), Tom Gilbert (drums), and past members including Jordan Puryear, Shane Lamphier, and Richie & Jennie Stearns.[1][3][4]

Donna the Buffalo's legacy lies in fostering community, with fans known as 'The Herd,' a self-organized tribe bonded at live events, and their influence on grassroots festivals and independent music. They've headlined major events like Telluride, South by Southwest, and Merlefest, toured Europe and the U.S. extensively (including opening for Peter Rowan), and featured in the documentary 'On The Bus.' Their music emphasizes lively, audience-driven performances that transcend the band itself.[1][3][4][6][8]

## Fun Facts
- The band's name originated from a mishearing of 'Dawn of the Buffalo' as 'Donna the Buffalo' during a whiskey-fueled brainstorming session for their first gig poster in 1988.[1][3][4][6]
- Jeb Puryear started playing fiddle at age 7 and busked with the Bubba George String Band as kids at Ithaca's farmer’s market and Commons for spare change; the group still performs occasionally at their GrassRoots Festival.[1]
- Their first festival in 1991 was a small AIDS benefit that organically grew into the massive four-day Finger Lakes GrassRoots Festival, raising hundreds of thousands for arts and education.[2][5]
- Fans are called 'The Herd,' a self-organized 'tribe' that connects at shows, embodying the band's community-focused lifestyle.[6][8]
