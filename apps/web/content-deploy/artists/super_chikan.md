## Biography
James “Super Chikan” Johnson was born in 1951 in the small Delta community of Darling, Mississippi, and raised in rural towns around Clarksdale in the Mississippi Delta, working on family farms and moving from town to town during his childhood. As a young boy, he earned the nickname “Chikan Boy” from conversing with family poultry, and he began his musical journey with a traditional one-stringed diddley bow before switching to guitar in his early teens. He absorbed blues from local legends, hiding under porches to listen to musicians at his grandfather’s parties, and was particularly influenced by Jimmy Reed, who once praised his playing.[1][5][7]

Johnson briefly played bass with the Jelly Roll Kings, a blues supergroup featuring his uncle Big Jack Johnson, neighbor Sam Carr, and Frank Frost, which gained regional fame for two decades. After years driving a truck and composing songs on the road—earning the “Super” prefix rumorously from his driving speed—he launched a professional career in the 1990s with exuberant recordings that blended traditional Delta blues with country fingerpicking, crowing, barnyard humor, and yodeling. Based in Clarksdale, he builds and paints unique “chiktars” from gas cans and ceiling fans, performs at Morgan Freeman’s Ground Zero club, and has toured worldwide.[1][2][3]

Super Chikan has received the Mississippi Governor’s Award for Excellence in the Arts, an Artist Fellowship from the Mississippi Arts Commission for his instrument building, and a Blues Music Award. His legacy includes preserving Delta blues roots through his distinctive style and a 2024 documentary 'A Life in Blues' featuring interviews with Bobby Rush and Cedric Burnside, highlighting his vaudeville-like stage presence and cultural contributions.[1][2][3][5]
