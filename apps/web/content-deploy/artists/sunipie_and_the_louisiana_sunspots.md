## Biography
Bruce 'Sunpie' Barnes, born on May 18, 1963, in Benton, Arkansas, as the tenth of eleven children to sharecropper parents, discovered his passion for music early through his father, Willie Barnes Sr., a blues harmonica player who introduced him to legends like Sonny Boy Williamson II. A talented athlete, Barnes earned All-American status as a defensive end at Henderson State University, where he majored in biology, and briefly played for the Kansas City Chiefs in the NFL before pursuing music and nature. In 1987, at age 23, he moved to Louisiana, working as a park ranger and naturalist at Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve's Barataria Preserve near New Orleans, leading educational tours, canoe trips, and night excursions while performing music locally.[1][2][3]

In 1991, Barnes founded Sunpie and the Louisiana Sunspots, pioneering 'Afro-Louisiana' music—a fusion of zydeco, Cajun, blues, gospel, jazz, and African/Afro-Caribbean rhythms—played on accordion (initially upside-down as a left-hander), harmonica, piano, trombone, rubboard, and more. The band became a staple at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival and Louisiana Cajun-Zydeco Festival, releasing six albums, touring over 50 countries, and featuring in more than 20 films and TV shows. Barnes shifted to New Orleans Jazz National Park in 1999, blending music with cultural education, and appeared in Sprite and McDonald's commercials.[1][2][3][5]

Beyond music, Barnes led the Northside Skull and Bones Gang from 2010, upholding a 1819 Mardi Gras tradition, co-authored the 2015 book 'Talk That Music Talk' on New Orleans brass bands, and contributed photography. After 30 years with the National Park Service, he continues as bandleader, merging conservation, culture, and performance worldwide.[1][5][7]

## Fun Facts
- Barnes paddled alone into Barataria Preserve wetlands at 2 a.m. in 1988 under a full moon, playing harmonica tunes from childhood like 'The Coon and the Hound,' inspiring his full-moon canoe tours that booked a year's worth of gigs after a New York Times article.[2]
- A left-handed accordion player, Barnes initially performed upside-down and backward before retraining to play right-handed and right-side-up.[1]
- He briefly played professional football as a defensive end for the Kansas City Chiefs after college.[3]
- In 2010, he became Big Chief of the Northside Skull and Bones Gang, a tradition dating to 1819, where members dress as skeletons before dawn on Mardi Gras, singing in Creole French and English to 'wake the spirits.'[1][5]
