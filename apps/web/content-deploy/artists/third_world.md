## Biography
Third World is a Jamaican reggae fusion band formed in 1973 by keyboardist Michael “Ibo” Cooper and guitarist/cellist Stephen “Cat” Coore, both formerly of Inner Circle, along with singer Milton “Prilly” Hamilton, bassist Richard Daley (from Tomorrow’s Children and Ken Boothe’s band), drummer Carl Barovier, and percussionist Irvin “Carrot” Jarrett. They debuted live at Jamaica’s independence celebration in 1974, recorded their first single “Railroad Track” that year, and signed with Island Records after traveling to England, opening for Bob Marley & the Wailers’ 1975 tour. Their self-titled debut album in 1976 featured a hit cover of “Satta Massagana,” and lineup changes soon followed, with William “Bunny Rugs” Clarke and drummer Willie Stewart replacing Hamilton and Barovier for the 1977 album *96° in the Shade*.[1][2][3][4]

The band blended reggae with soul, funk, disco, and pop, achieving crossover success with hits like “Now That We Found Love” (1978), “The Story’s Been Told” (1979), “Dancing on the Floor (Hooked on Love)” (1981), and Stevie Wonder’s “Try Jah Love” (1982). They released albums on Island, CBS, Mercury, and their own TWB label, earning 10 Grammy nominations starting with *Hold on to Love* (1987). Lineup shifts continued, including Cooper and Stewart’s departure in 1997, replaced by Leroy “Baarbe” Romans and Tony “Ruption” Williams.[1][3][7]

Celebrated as 'Reggae Ambassadors' and one of Jamaica’s longest-running bands (over 50 years), Third World remains active, known for touring and fusing reggae with diverse influences while maintaining Richard Daley as the sole constant member.[3][7][8]
