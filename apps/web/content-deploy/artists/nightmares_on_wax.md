## Biography
George Herbert Evelyn, born on January 15, 1970, in Leeds, West Yorkshire, England, began his musical journey immersed in hip-hop and b-boy culture during the late 1980s. Starting as a breakdancer and DJ, he formed Nightmares on Wax with Kevin Harper (aka Boy Wonder) and production specialist John Halnon, releasing the influential single 'Dextrous' on their Poverty Records label in 1988, which sampled A Guy Called Gerald's 'Voodoo Ray' and became a cornerstone of the Northern Bleep movement alongside tracks like Unique 3's 'The Theme' and LFO's 'Frequencies'. Their debut album, *A Word of Science (The 1st and Final Chapter)*, arrived in 1991 on Warp Records, blending funk-laden downtempo house, hip-hop beats, and early rave elements, marking Evelyn's entry into trip-hop and chillout genres.[1][2][5]

After Harper and Halnon departed following the debut to pursue solo projects, Evelyn continued solo as Nightmares on Wax, solidifying his signature sound fusing electronic sounds, hip-hop, jazz, reggae, dub, soul, and downtempo beats. Key albums like *Smoker's Delight* (1995), *Car Boot Soul* (1998) featuring Sarah Winton's vocals, *Mind Elevation* (2002), and *In a Space Outta Sound* (2006) established him as a pioneer of chillout and trip-hop, with releases on Warp Records over three decades. Now based in Ibiza, he has evolved his style, incorporating live musicians, gospel choirs, and global collaborations in recent works like *Shout Out! To Freedom* and *Echo45 Sound System* mixtape, reflecting personal growth and cultural exploration.[1][2][3][4]

Nightmares on Wax's legacy endures as Warp's longest-serving active artist, having influenced electronic music's evolution with emotionally resonant, sample-driven productions that prioritize 'magic moments' and left-of-center experimentation, paving the way for downtempo, nu jazz, and UK bass scenes while maintaining relevance through constant sonic reinvention.[3][4][6]
