## Biography
The Chi-Lites are an American R&B/soul vocal quartet formed in Chicago in 1959, originally called the Hi-Lites before changing their name to the Chi-Lites in 1964 to honor their hometown.[1] The group's original lineup consisted of Eugene Record, Robert "Squirrel" Lester, Creadel "Red" Jones, and Marshall Thompson, with Record serving as the group's primary songwriter, lead singer, and sole creative force throughout their most successful period.[1][2] The Chi-Lites achieved their greatest fame during the late 1960s through the early 1970s, becoming one of the few major soul groups of that era to emerge from Chicago rather than Memphis or Philadelphia.[3] After signing with Brunswick Records in 1968 under producer Carl Davis, the group scored eleven top-ten R&B chart hits between 1969 and 1974, with major successes including "Give It Away" (1969), "Are You My Woman? (Tell Me So)" (1971), "Have You Seen Her?" (1971), and "Oh Girl" (1972).[1][2][3] The group also charted 21 songs on the Billboard Hot 100 Pop Chart and achieved international success in Australia, the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Canada.[1]

The Chi-Lites' musical style was characterized by smooth, sophisticated soul vocals featuring Eugene Record's warm, pleading tenor and falsetto, often accompanied by lush orchestral arrangements.[2] Record frequently collaborated with other songwriters, most notably Barbara Acklin, in crafting the group's hits.[2][3] The group experienced significant personnel changes throughout their career, with Record departing during their commercial peak in the mid-1970s and returning briefly in 1980 before leaving again in 1990.[1][3] Despite these changes, the group continued to perform and record, with Marshall Thompson emerging as the sole surviving original member who has maintained the Chi-Lites' legacy into the 21st century.[1][2] The group's influence extended beyond their era, with their 1970s track "Are You My Woman" being sampled by Beyoncé Knowles in her hit "Crazy in Love."[3]

## Fun Facts
- The Chi-Lites' name change in 1964 from "Marshall & The Hi-Lites" to "The Chi-Lites" was specifically designed to add the letter 'C' as a tribute to their hometown of Chicago.[1][4]
- Eugene Record was the sole songwriter for the group and never collaborated with members outside the Chi-Lites, maintaining complete creative control over the group's musical output.[1]
- The group's 1970s album track "Are You My Woman" was sampled by Beyoncé Knowles in her massive worldwide hit "Crazy in Love," introducing the Chi-Lites' smooth soul sound to a new generation.[3]
- Marshall Thompson is the sole surviving original founding member of the Chi-Lites, with Robert "Squirrel" Lester passing away in January 2010 and Eugene Record dying in July 2005 following a long battle with cancer.[1]
