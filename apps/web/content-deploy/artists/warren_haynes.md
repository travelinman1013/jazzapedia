## Biography
Warren Haynes, born in Asheville, North Carolina, developed his musical foundation in early childhood through exposure to black gospel music in the car around age 5 or 6, followed by a deep love for soul music that shaped his soulful blues-rock style. He began his professional career cutting his teeth with David Allan Coe before joining Dickey Betts' band for 2-3 years, honing his guitar skills, tone, and stage presence in preparation for bigger stages. This groundwork led to his pivotal role in the re-formed Allman Brothers Band starting in 1989, where he became a key figure as guitarist and vocalist, contributing to their legacy while embracing live improvisation that keeps every performance unique.[1][2][3]
