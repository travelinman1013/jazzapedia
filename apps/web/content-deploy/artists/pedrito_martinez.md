## Biography
Pedro Pablo “Pedrito” Martinez was born on September 12, 1973, in the Cayo Hueso neighborhood of Old Havana, Cuba. He began his musical career at age 11 as a vocalist and percussionist, performing with Cuban legends such as Tata Güines and Los Munequitos de Matanzas, and immersed himself in the rumba traditions of numerous Cuban groups. In 1998, he toured Canada with Jane Bunnett's Spirits of Havana and decided to stay in North America, settling in New York City that fall, where he quickly won first prize in the 1998 Thelonious Monk Competition for Afro-Latin Hand Percussion at the Kennedy Center.[1][2][7]

Martinez's career accelerated in New York as a founding member of the Afro-Cuban/Afro-Beat band Yerba Buena around 2003-2004, recording albums *President Alien* (2003) and *Island Life* (2005, which reached No. 62 on Billboard's Top Latin Albums Chart), and touring worldwide. In 2005, he formed the Pedrito Martinez Group with a residency at Guantanamera restaurant in Manhattan, attracting stars like Eric Clapton and Paul Simon. The group's self-titled debut album in 2013 on Motema Music earned a Grammy nomination for Best Latin Jazz Album, NPR's Favorite Albums of 2013, and Boston Globe's Top Ten. His 2016 album *Habana Dreams*, recorded in Cuba, featured guests like Wynton Marsalis, Rubén Blades, Angélique Kidjo, and Issac Delgado.[1][2][3]

Known for his charismatic fusion of **afro-cuban jazz**, **timba**, **son cubano**, and **latin jazz**, Martinez blends traditional rumba, conga, and batá drumming with modern jazz and vocal prowess. A member of Jazz at Lincoln Center's Nuevo Jazz Latino program, he has contributed to over 100 albums and performed with icons like Paul Simon, Bruce Springsteen, Sting, Chucho Valdés, and Eddie Palmieri, establishing a lasting legacy as a bridge between Cuban roots and global jazz innovation.[1][2][3][7]
