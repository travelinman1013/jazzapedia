## Biography
Mthutuzeli Dudu Pukwana was born on 18 July 1938 in Walmer Township, Port Elizabeth, South Africa, into a family of musicians with his mother as a vocalist and father as a singer and pianist.[2] He initially studied piano at home, following his father's influence, and performed with local bands including the Broadway Yanks and the Four Yanks.[1] A pivotal moment came in 1956 when he met tenor saxophonist Nikele Moyake, whose distinctive sound so captivated Pukwana that he switched to alto saxophone.[3] By the early 1960s, he had established himself in the South African jazz scene and caught the attention of visionary pianist Chris McGregor, leading to his formation of the pioneering Blue Notes sextet in Cape Town alongside Moyake, Mongezi Feza, Johnny Dyani, and Louis Moholo.[2][3]

As a mixed-race ensemble, the Blue Notes faced constant harassment from apartheid authorities, which prompted their emigration to Europe in 1964.[3] The group performed at the 1964 Antibes Jazz Festival in France and eventually settled in London, where their unique blend of township kwela music and hard bop transformed British jazz.[2] After the Blue Notes disbanded in the late 1960s, Pukwana joined Chris McGregor's Brotherhood of Breath big band, where he composed the celebrated tune "Mra."[1][3] He subsequently formed multiple groups including Assagai and Spear with former Blue Notes members Feza and Moholo, blending afro-rock and afro-jazz elements.[3] In 1978, Pukwana founded his own record label, Jika Records, and formed the band Zila with vocalist Pinise Saul and guitarist Lucky Ranku, recording three albums between 1981 and 1986.[2][3]

Pukwana's career was marked by his synthesis of South African township jazz roots with European free jazz, creating a sound that conveyed messages of peace, love, and acceptance.[2] He collaborated with prominent jazz artists including Hugh Masekela, Jonas Gwangwa, and Don Cherry, and was featured at the Nelson Mandela Tribute at Wembley Stadium in 1989.[1] He died in London on 30 June 1990 of liver failure at age 51, never returning to his homeland but solidifying his legacy as an iconic expatriate musician.[1][2]
