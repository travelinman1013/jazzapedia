## Biography
The Pharcyde is an American alternative hip-hop group formed in 1989 in South Central Los Angeles, consisting originally of Imani (Emandu Wilcox) from Compton, Slimkid3 (Trevant Hardson) from Inglewood or South Central, Bootie Brown (Romye Robinson) from Altadena or Pasadena, and Fatlip (Derrick Stewart) from the Fairfax District. The members met as dancers in high school, initially pursuing dancing through groups like '242,' which appeared on *In Living Color* and in an Herb Alpert video, and earlier rap groups such as 'As Is' and 'Play Brothers.' Bootie Brown introduced Fatlip, completing the lineup around 1990, with DJs like Mark Luv, producer J-Swift, and later J Dilla contributing early.[1][2][3][4]

Signed to Delicious Vinyl after a 1991 demo featuring 'Passin' Me By' and 'Ya Mama,' their debut album *Bizarre Ride II the Pharcyde* (1992) became a cornerstone of alternative hip-hop with hits like 'Passin' Me By,' praised for its jazz-infused beats, humorous lyrics, and offbeat style distinct from gangsta rap. Their 1995 follow-up *Labcabincalifornia* achieved commercial success with singles 'Drop' and 'Runnin',' blending West Coast hip-hop with jazz rap and old-school influences. Later albums like *Labcabincalifornia* (1995) faced challenges, leading to lineup changes.[2][4][5][8]

Tensions arose in the late 1990s and early 2000s; Slimkid3 (Tre Hardson) left in 2002 for solo work like *Liberation*, Fatlip released *The Loneliest Punk* (2005), and Imani with Bootie Brown issued *Humboldt Beginnings* (2004) with new members. The group splintered into duos but reunited sporadically, with Imani, Slimkid3, and Fatlip touring as 'The Far Side (formerly of the Pharcyde)' in 2022. Known for pioneering jazz rap and alternative hip-hop, their legacy endures through tours, solo projects, and acclaim as one of the genre's greatest acts.[2][3][4][7]
