## Biography
Ariana Grande was born in Boca Raton, Florida, and began her performing career young, singing on cruise ships and appearing in musicals like *Annie*. At age 15, she debuted on Broadway in *13* in 2008, earning a National Youth Theatre Association Award, which led to her breakthrough role as Cat Valentine on Nickelodeon’s *Victorious* (2010-2013) and spin-off *Sam & Cat*. Signed to Republic Records in 2011, she transitioned to music with her debut single “Put Your Hearts Up” and album *Yours Truly* in 2013, featuring Mac Miller on “The Way,” which peaked at No. 9 on the Billboard Hot 100[1][2].

Grande’s career exploded with albums like *My Everything* (2014), *Dangerous Woman* (2016), *Sweetener* (2018), *Thank U, Next* (2019), *Positions* (2020), and others, achieving multiple No. 1 hits including “Thank U, Next,” “7 Rings,” “Positions,” “Rain On Me” with Lady Gaga, and “Stuck With U” with Justin Bieber. Her style blends pop, R&B, and trap elements, highlighted by her four-octave vocal range and whistle register. She won two Grammy Awards, including Best Pop Vocal Album for *Sweetener*, and became the first solo artist to occupy the top three Billboard Hot 100 spots simultaneously[1][2]. In 2024, she starred as Glinda in *Wicked*, earning Oscar and Golden Globe nominations[1].

Grande’s legacy includes seven No. 1 albums, 18 Grammy nominations, headlining Coachella in 2019 as the youngest and fourth woman to do so (later surpassed by Billie Eilish), and a signature high ponytail look. Her music often reflects personal struggles, solidifying her as a pop icon with acting ventures continuing into 2026[1][2].
