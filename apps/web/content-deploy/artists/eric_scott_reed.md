## Biography
Eric Scott Reed, born in West Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, began playing piano at age two as a child prodigy, performing gospel music in his father's storefront Baptist church by age five. His father, a minister and member of the Gospel group Bay State Singers, was his earliest influence, alongside radio hits from artists like James Cleveland, Andraé Crouch, and Earth, Wind & Fire. Formal training started at age seven at Philadelphia’s Settlement Music School, though largely self-taught, he was drawn to jazz after hearing Art Blakey, Ramsey Lewis, and Dave Brubeck. At eleven, his family moved to Los Angeles, where he studied at the Colburn School, exploring jazz pianists through library records.[1][3][5]

By age 18, Reed toured internationally as a leader and sideman, gaining prominence with Wynton Marsalis’ Septet (1990-1991, 1992-1995) and Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra (1996-1998), recording albums like *Citi Movement* and *Blood On The Fields*. He collaborated with Freddie Hubbard and Joe Henderson (1991-1992), and later Wayne Shorter, Clark Terry, and others. Reed released over 20 albums as a leader, including *The Adventurous Monk*, *Groovewise*, and 2023's *Black, Brown and Blue*, blending gospel roots, swing, and innovative standards interpretations. He composed for films like *Life*, worked with Alvin Ailey Dance Theater, and taught at Juilliard and the University of Tennessee.[2][3][4][5]

Now based between Los Angeles and Tennessee, Reed leads ensembles like his 2005 quartet with Willie Jones III, Gerald Cannon, and Stacy Dillard, and debuted XYZ in 2024. His style fuses gospel, hard bop, and modal improvisation, influenced by Miles Davis and Bill Evans, while his role as educator and conductor underscores his legacy in preserving and evolving jazz.[1][2][3]
