## Biography
Trixie Smith (c. 1895 – September 21, 1943) was an African-American blues singer, vaudeville entertainer, recording artist, and actress born and raised in a middle-class family in Atlanta, Georgia. She attended Selma University in Alabama before moving to New York around 1915, where she performed in minstrel shows and on the TOBA vaudeville circuit, developing her distinctive blues style characterized by powerful vocals, comic talent, and versatility across blues, jazz, and cabaret revues. In 1922, she made her recording debut with Black Swan Records, winning a prominent blues singing contest at the Inter-Manhattan Casino with her composition 'Trixie's Blues,' which boosted her career.[1][2][5]

Smith's peak recording years in the 1920s saw her release around four dozen sides for labels like Black Swan, Paramount, and Decca, often under names like Trixie Smith and Her Down Home Syncopators. Standout tracks include 'Railroad Blues' (1925), 'Freight Train Blues,' and 'The World Is Jazz Crazy and So Am I' (1925), featuring inspired vocal performances backed by elite jazz musicians; her style evolved from polished vaudeville blues to more direct and sexual expressions by the late 1930s. As blues recording opportunities declined, she sustained her career through stage revues like New York Revue (1928), Broadway's The Constant Sinner (1931), and Theatre Guild's Louisiana (1933), plus films including The Black King (1932) and Swing! (1938).[1][2][3][5]

Smith's legacy endures as a classic blues pioneer who bridged vaudeville and early jazz, inspiring later rhythm-and-blues and soul singers with her expressive voice and train-themed songs reflecting the Great Migration era. Her 1938 appearance at John Hammond's 'From Spirituals to Swing' concert at Carnegie Hall reignited recordings with all-star groups into the early 1940s, cementing her influence until her death in New York at age 48.[3][5][6]
