## Biography
Joyce Silveira Moreno (born Joyce Silveira Palhano de Jesus on January 31, 1948) is a Brazilian singer, songwriter, guitarist, and arranger from Rio de Janeiro, widely regarded as one of the foremost voices of post–bossa nova and modern MPB (música popular brasileira).[1][5][6][8] Raised in Rio with her mother and two older brothers, she absorbed the new harmonies and rhythms of bossa nova firsthand as they emerged in the late 1950s and 1960s, learning guitar by watching her guitarist brother and frequenting a home visited by prominent musicians such as Luiz Carlos Vinhas, Leny Andrade, and the Castro Neves brothers.[1][3][6] At age sixteen she made her first studio recording at the invitation of guitarist/producer Roberto Menescal, singing on a record by the vocal group Sambacana, and soon became an in-demand jingle singer while she began composing songs more as a pastime than with a clear professional goal.[1][6]

Her professional recording career took off at the end of the 1960s, leading to early albums such as “Encontro Marcado” (1969) and international performances with Edu Lobo in Lisbon.[1] In the 1970s she worked in experimental groups including Sagrada Família and A Tribo alongside musicians like Luiz Eça, Nelson Angelo, Naná Vasconcelos, Toninho Horta, Novelli, and Maurício Maestro, and in 1977 she recorded the jazz-inflected but unreleased album “Natureza” in New York with producer Claus Ogerman and players Michael Brecker, Buster Williams, and Joe Farrell, consolidating her personal style that fused bossa nova’s harmonic subtlety with jazz phrasing.[1][2][4] Her breakthrough to a broader Brazilian public came in 1980 when the lullaby “Clareana,” written for her daughters with Maestro, became a hit at TV Globo’s MPB Festival, and the album “Feminina” (1980) yielded enduring songs such as “Feminina,” “Clareana,” “Mistérios,” and “Aldeia de Ogum.”[1][2][4] From the 1980s onward she built a large discography, winning a Best Independent Album award for “Tardes Cariocas” (1984), touring Japan and Europe, and later seeing her 1970s–80s work embraced by the acid-jazz and club scenes in London, where DJs championed tracks like “Aldeia de Ogum” and “Baracumbara.”[1][4]

Joyce’s musical style is marked by sophisticated guitar voicings, jazz-oriented harmonies, and a conversational, rhythmically agile vocal delivery that keeps one foot in classic bossa nova and another in contemporary Brazilian jazz and MPB.[1][3][5][7] Lyrically she is celebrated as a pioneer of a woman-centered, first-person perspective in Brazilian songwriting, addressing female subjectivity and everyday life from a distinctly feminine viewpoint at a time when most canonical MPB composers were men.[5][7] Antonio Carlos Jobim hailed her as “one of the best singers of all time,” and over a five-decade career she has recorded more than 30 albums and some 400 songs, with her work interpreted by leading Brazilian artists.[5][9] In the 1990s and 2000s Joyce strengthened her international profile with tours across Europe, North America, and Japan, residency on the Japanese Blue Note circuit, teaching and workshops (including at Berklee and conservatories in Denmark and South Africa), and curatorship of major bossa nova tribute events, while continuing to record new albums such as “Tudo Bonito,” “Rio,” and “Raiz,” the latter celebrating 50 years of her recording career and reaffirming her status as a key bridge between the original bossa generation and newer Brazilian and global jazz audiences.[1][3][5]

## Fun Facts
- She originally performed and recorded simply as "Joyce" for most of her career, but later began using her full surname "Moreno" in part so that listeners could more easily find her on the internet.[3][4]
- Her breakthrough lullaby "Clareana" was written in Rome in 1976 for her daughters Clara and Ana, and the lyrics even anticipate a future child with the line "Clara, Ana e quem mais chegar" (“Clara, Ana, and whoever else arrives”).[1][4]
- The 1977 New York album "Natureza," produced by Claus Ogerman and featuring jazz stars like Michael Brecker, Buster Williams, and Joe Farrell, was never released, yet several of its songs later became some of the most emblematic in her career, including "Feminina" and "Mistérios."[1][2][4]
- In the early 1990s she became the first Brazilian artist to perform on London’s acid-jazz circuit, and English DJs helped turn songs like "Aldeia de Ogum," "Feminina," and "Baracumbara" into cult hits on dance floors around the world.[1][2]
