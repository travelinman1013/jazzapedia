## Biography
The Chambers Brothers are an American psychedelic soul band that originated in Carthage, Mississippi, where the four brothers—George, Joe, Lester, and Willie Chambers—first developed their musical talents singing in their Baptist church choir.[1] After George was drafted into the Army in 1952, the brothers eventually reunited in Los Angeles in the mid-1950s, where they began performing gospel and folk music throughout Southern California starting in 1954.[1] The group gained national attention when they appeared at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival, where they performed with such energy that the MC declared, "Whether you know it or not, that was rock 'n' roll."[1] Around this time, they added white drummer Brian Keenan to their lineup, becoming one of the first interracial bands and shifting their sound toward rock and soul.[5]

The Chambers Brothers achieved their greatest commercial success in 1968 with "Time Has Come Today," an 11-minute psychedelic soul opus written by Joe and Willie Chambers that featured echoing vocal effects, driving drumming, and the memorable lyric "my soul's been psychedelicized."[1][3] The song spent five consecutive weeks at No. 11 on the Billboard Hot 100 in September–October 1968 and reached No. 9 in Canada, becoming their only major hit.[1] With roots in R&B, rock, gospel, funk, and psychedelia, the band became one of the premiere psychedelic soul groups of the 1960s, integrating American blues and gospel traditions with modern psychedelic and rock elements.[1][7] Though they released several additional singles including "I Can't Turn You Loose" (#37 in 1968), none achieved comparable chart success.[5] The band's music has remained culturally relevant through frequent use in film soundtracks, and the brothers reunited periodically for performances, including a historic sold-out Gospel & Soul show at The Ash Grove in Santa Monica in 1997 and Los Angeles area shows beginning in 2016.[1]

## Fun Facts
- Willie Chambers extended the original 2.5-minute version of "Time Has Come Today" to 11 minutes and some seconds during a studio session, calling it "our contribution to psychedelic music."[6]
- The Chambers Brothers were an interracial band at a time when this was uncommon, with white drummer Brian Keenan joining the four Black brothers in 1965.[2][5]
- Willie Chambers stated in a 2022 interview that he never used hard drugs throughout his life, only marijuana, and attributed his "high" to being natural rather than chemical.[6]
- The group was too diverse in style to be easily categorized—they were "too rock for folk, too secular for gospel, too raw, real and passionate for rock," making them Renaissance Men of American popular music.[8]
