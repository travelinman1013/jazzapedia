## Biography
Topsy Chapman is a renowned New Orleans jazz and gospel singer born and raised in Kentwood, Louisiana, near New Orleans, where she was immersed in the gospel music tradition from a young age. Her career gained international prominence through the musical 'One Mo’ Time,' set in 1920s New Orleans, which ran at the Toulouse Theater in the French Quarter during the 1980s, later transferring to New York and Europe, introducing her distinctive gospel-tinged voice to global audiences.[2] She performs regularly at iconic New Orleans venues like Donna’s, Snug Harbor, and the Palm Court, as well as festivals such as the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival and Satchmo Summerfest, collaborating with elite local musicians in groups including the Magnolia Brass Band, Jim Cullum Jazz Band, Lars Edegran Orchestra, and Brian Carrick’s New Orleans Heritage Band.[2]

Koen De Cauter, born in 1954 in Belgium, is a versatile jazz guitarist, saxophonist, and singer known for his unique style blending Gypsy jazz, New Orleans swing, flamenco, musette, and French chanson influences like Georges Brassens. Growing up around Gypsy communities in Belgium, he began his career playing in the band of Gypsy violinist Piotto Limberger, then co-founded the acclaimed Gypsy swing group Waso in 1975 with Fapy Lafertin and Vivi Limberger. His approach emphasizes slower tempos to highlight musicality and melancholy melodies, as showcased in projects like 'A Little Corner of Paradise Vol. 1,' a 1988 re-release featuring New Orleans swing with clarinetist Orange Kellin, pianist David Paquette, and vocalist Topsy Chapman.[1][3]

Together, Chapman and De Cauter represent a transatlantic fusion of New Orleans jazz traditions and European Gypsy swing, evident in their shared recording on De Cauter's 'A Little Corner of Paradise Vol. 1,' where Chapman's vocals complement the ensemble's warm, rich sessions despite mixed reviews on her delivery. Chapman's legacy includes albums like 'My One and Only Love' (2001) tributing Louis Armstrong with family members and pros like Lucien Barbarin, and gospel-infused works with the Magnolia Jazz Band; De Cauter's endures through decades of innovative Gypsy jazz and solo endeavors, influencing cross-cultural jazz scenes.[1][2]
