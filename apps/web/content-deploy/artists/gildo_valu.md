## Biography
Gildo Valú is a capoeira master who learned his craft in Salvador, Brazil, the birthplace of capoeira. His training was primarily conducted in the street rodas (circles) of Pelourinho and Mercado Modelo, where he absorbed both contemporary and traditional capoeira styles. He studied under Mestre Boca Rica and trained with several other schools, developing a distinctive style that blends traditional and contemporary approaches. Valú began his teaching career in the early 1980s, establishing himself as an influential instructor and cultural ambassador.

Beyond his role as a capoeira instructor, Valú has also pursued musical endeavors, recording Afro-Brazilian music and rhythms. His work reflects the deep connection between capoeira and music, as capoeira combines dance, acrobatics, music, and martial arts. Through his teaching and performances, Valú has expanded his influence internationally, with students in Brazil, Holland, Gambia, and the United States. He founded Grupo Balança Nashville, a capoeira group operating under the non-profit Global Education Center in Nashville, where he continues to teach and preserve capoeira traditions while fostering cultural exchange.
