## Biography
Public Enemy is an American hip-hop group formed in 1982 at Adelphi University on Long Island, New York, by Chuck D (Carlton Ridenhour), Hank Shocklee, and Bill Stephney, who initially collaborated on a college radio program called the Super Spectrum Mix Show.[1][3][4] The group's official formation occurred when Rick Rubin of Def Jam Records heard Chuck D's rap "Public Enemy No. 1" and signed him to a recording contract in 1986, leading Chuck D to assemble the full Public Enemy lineup with producer Hank Shocklee, DJ Terminator X (Norman Lee Rogers), and Professor Griff (Richard Griffin) as the leader of the S1W (Security of the First World) backup dancers.[4][5] Public Enemy released their critically acclaimed debut album *Yo! Bum Rush the Show* in 1987, but achieved massive success with their 1988 sophomore album *It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back*, which reached number one on the R&B chart and number 42 on the pop chart, establishing them as household names.[5]

The group became renowned for their **dense, layered sound** and **radical political messaging** addressing American racism, media criticism, and social injustice, making them among the most popular, controversial, and influential hip-hop artists of the late 1980s and early 1990s.[3] Their hit singles including "Don't Believe the Hype" and "Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos" helped spark the golden age of rap and influenced artists across multiple genres.[2] Public Enemy continued releasing albums throughout the 1990s and 2000s, including *New World Order*, *How You Sell Soul to a Soulless People Who Sold Their Soul?* (2007), *Beats and Places* (2011), and *Most of My Heroes Still Don't Appear on No Stamp* and *The Evil Empire of Everything* (both 2012).[5] Their iconic song "Fight the Power" was ranked number one on VH1's *The 100 Greatest Hip-Hop Songs* in 2009, cementing their legacy as pioneers who brought sonic invention, rhyming virtuosity, and social awareness to hip-hop.[5]

## Fun Facts
- Public Enemy was initially called "Spectrum City" when Chuck D and the Shocklee brothers performed together at Adelphi University's student radio station WBAU, before Rick Rubin encouraged them to adopt the name Public Enemy based on Chuck D's independent single "Public Enemy No. 1."[4][7]
- Rick Rubin was reportedly so impressed by Chuck D's booming voice that he actively pursued him to record, eventually signing him to Def Jam Records in 1986.[3]
- Public Enemy's second album *It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back* (1988) was the first hip-hop album to top *The Village Voice*'s prestigious Pazz & Jop critics' poll.[1]
- DJ Terminator X suffered a severe motorcycle accident in 1994 that shattered his left leg, leading to his retirement from the group in 1998 after over a decade as the group's turntablist.[5]
