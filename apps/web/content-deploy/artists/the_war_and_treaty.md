## Biography
The War and Treaty is a Nashville-based husband-and-wife duo formed in 2014 by Michael Trotter Jr. and Tanya Trotter. Michael, a U.S. Army veteran, discovered his musical talent during two tours in Iraq, where he learned piano on an instrument once owned by Saddam Hussein and began songwriting after the death of a fellow soldier. Dropping out of high school and facing a troubled path, he joined the Army, endured combat wounds, and developed PTSD. Tanya, previously pursuing an R&B career with a Billboard Hot 100 song, faced setbacks including her brother's death, a major label drop, depression, and suicide attempts; she worked as a church worship leader to support her young son.[1][2][3][5][7]

The couple met in 2010 at Maryland's Spirit of Love festival, married in 2011, and began performing together as Trotter and Blunt before settling on The War and Treaty in 2014 amid Michael's PTSD challenges. Their music fuses country, Americana, blues, R&B, soul, and gospel, reflecting personal triumphs over adversity and their marital bond. Albums include their 2018 self-titled debut, 2020's sophomore release, major-label debut Lover’s Game (Mercury Nashville, 2023), and 2025's Plus One. They've earned Grammy nominations for Best New Artist and Best American Roots Song ('Blank Page', 2024), CMA Duo of the Year (first Black duo nominated), ACM Vocal Duo, and two Americana Music Awards for Duo/Group of the Year.[1][2][3][4][5][6]

Their electrifying live shows and raw storytelling have garnered acclaim from The Tennessean as 'unlike any other act in music,' with recognition from the Country Music Hall of Fame, Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, and Grand Ole Opry. Touring with artists like Chris Stapleton and performing on CMA Awards with Brothers Osborne, they continue breaking barriers in country and roots music while focusing on legacy.[2][4][5]
