## Biography
Max Woiski Jr. (born Max René Valentino Mackintosh on May 13, 1930, in Paramaribo, Suriname) was a Surinamese singer, guitarist, and bandleader who became a prominent figure in Caribbean and Dutch popular music. He was brought to the Netherlands by his father, Max Woiski Sr., a renowned Surinamese musician, when his father needed a guitarist for his orchestra. Following his father's relocation to Mallorca in the late 1950s, Max Woiski Jr. established himself as an independent artist, founding the nightclub La Tropicana in Amsterdam's Leidsedwarsstraat in 1961, which became a celebrated venue attracting international artists including Ella Fitzgerald.

During the 1960s and 1970s, Max Woiski Jr. achieved significant commercial success in the Netherlands with his Caribbean and Surinamese music. He scored multiple hit records in the 1970s, including "Je bent nog niet gelukkig met een mooie vrouw," "Beter dan ooit," and "Rijst met Kouseband." His orchestra performed regularly at La Tropicana and gained considerable popularity on Dutch television. In the 1960s, he established his own production company, MMP (distributed by CNR Records), which signed notable artists such as Ciska Peters and Edwin Rutten, establishing him as both a performer and music industry entrepreneur.

Woiski Jr. continued performing and recording throughout his life, with albums including "Successen" (1973), "Bigi Brasa" (1998), and "Ritmo Tropical" (2011). He passed away on March 23, 2011, in Alkmaar, Netherlands, at the age of 80. His legacy includes not only his own musical contributions but also his role in promoting Surinamese and Caribbean music in the Netherlands, and his family's continued involvement in music through his granddaughter, Lils Mackintosh, a jazz and blues singer.
