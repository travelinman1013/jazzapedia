## Biography
Luciana Souza, born on July 12, 1966, in São Paulo, Brazil, grew up in a family deeply immersed in bossa nova; her father, Walter Santos, was a singer, songwriter, and session musician who contributed to recordings by Antônio Carlos Jobim and João Gilberto, while her mother, Tereza Souza, was a poet and lyricist. She began her recording career remarkably early, at age three with a radio commercial, and by 16 had become a seasoned studio veteran, recording over 200 jingles and soundtracks. At 17, in 1985, she moved to the United States to study at Berklee College of Music, earning a bachelor's degree in jazz composition and later serving on its faculty for four years; she also obtained a master's in jazz studies from the New England Conservatory of Music and taught at the Manhattan School of Music, UCLA, CalArts, and since 2024 at USC Thornton School of Music.[1][2]

Souza's career as a performer and composer spans Brazilian jazz, bossa nova, vocal jazz, Latin jazz, pop, classical, and chamber music, earning her acclaim for her smooth, sensuous, and agile voice, often described as 'transcendental' and of 'unparalleled beauty.' She has released acclaimed albums since 2002, including her Universal debut *The New Bossa Nova* produced by her husband Larry Klein, and Grammy-nominated works like *Brazilian Duos* (2003), *North and South* (2004), *Duos II* (2006), *Tide* (2010), *Duos III* (2013), *The Book of Chet* (2013), and *Cometa* (2024). She won a Grammy in 2007 (and Album of the Year) as featured vocalist on Herbie Hancock's *River: The Joni Letters*, with seven total nominations, and was named Jazz Journalists Association Female Singer of the Year in 2005 and 2013.[1][2][3]

Her musical style transcends genres, blending solid jazz roots with world music and new compositions, including works with poets like Elizabeth Bishop and Pablo Neruda. Longstanding duo partnerships, especially with guitarist Romero Lubambo, and performances with major orchestras highlight her legacy as one of jazz's leading interpreters, with over 60 recordings as a side artist.[1][2][4]
