## Biography
Bandiera Rossa, also known as Avanti Popolo, is not a musical artist or band but one of the most famous anthems of the Italian labour movement, written in 1908 by Carlo Tuzzi with a melody derived from two traditional Lombard folk songs. The lyrics glorify the red flag as a symbol of socialist and communist movements, calling the people to rise up with lines like 'Avanti o popolo, alla riscossa / Bandiera rossa trionferà!'[1][2][5][8]. Created during a period of intense labour activism in Italy, the song quickly became a rallying cry for workers and socialists, embodying the spirit of class struggle and revolution.

Throughout the 20th century, Bandiera Rossa was adapted and performed widely, especially under Mussolini's fascist regime when a defiant stanza praising communism and liberty was added. It was recorded by groups like Corale Verdi Milano on a Fonotecnica 78 RPM record used by the Italian Communist Party (PCI) in the 1960s, and by M. Corrado Zaccari's Brass Band of Conselice in 1974[2][4]. Modern covers include versions by Scottish band Tarneybackle in a Spanish Civil War medley and UK punk band Angelic Upstarts on their 2002 album Sons of Sparticus, demonstrating its enduring appeal in leftist and protest music traditions[1].

The song's legacy persists in political rallies, protests, and cultural references, such as the 1986 Israeli film Avanti Popolo, where soldiers sing it ironically in the Sinai Desert post-1967 War. Its simple, marching melody and revolutionary message ensure its place as an iconic piece of socialist heritage, frequently revived by modern communist and socialist parties[1][5].

## Fun Facts
- The song's alternative title 'Avanti Popolo' was used to distinguish it from another socialist anthem 'Le tre bandiere' and inspired the name of a 1986 Israeli film where soldiers sing it mockingly[1].
- A 78 RPM record of the song by Corale Verdi Milano was used by the Italian Communist Party in 1960s public performances but broke during transport and was repaired, causing audible clicks[2].
- After Mussolini's rise, a defiant stanza 'Evviva il comunismo/socialismo e la libertà' was added to the lyrics[5].
- A Leeds ceilidh band named Bandiera Rossa was formed in 1992 by parents from a co-operative children's organization, unrelated to the song's origins[7].
