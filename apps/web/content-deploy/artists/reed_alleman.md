## Biography
Reed Alleman is a New Orleans-based singer/songwriter known for his locally inspired songwriting rooted in South Louisiana culture, performing along the Gulf Coast for over two decades. His music often tackles themes from his upbringing, including marsh and swampland destruction, Mississippi River refineries, Hurricane Katrina, and colorful local characters like radio personality Don Dubuc and fisherman Deadly Dudley, set against small towns such as Chipola, Sorrento, and Cocodrie. He shifts seamlessly to broader topics like soldiers at war in songs such as 'Fortunes Of War' and real-life narratives.[1]

Alleman's career includes performances at prestigious events like the New Orleans French Quarter Festival’s BMI Songwriters Stage, BMI’s Key West Songwriter’s Festival, and the Mississippi Songwriter’s Festival, as well as live broadcasts on WWOZ radio and interviews on WWL radio. He has released three CDs over the last decade, with songs featured in projects like the documentary 'The Sojourners' ('Life’s A Strange Game'), the Hurricane Hymns compilation ('Katrina'), and as the theme for the Don Dubuc Radio Show. Notable travels with the Gumbo Krewe post-9/11 to NYC and to Camp Lejeune for troops inspired 'Operation Gumbo Drop' and 'You Don’t Even Know Me,' covered by Time Magazine and Inside Northside Magazine. He performs solo and with the Reed Alleman Band at venues like Hard Rock Casino and Margaritaville, and is part of the Voices Of New Orleans songwriters group.[1]

His musical style blends Cajun influences with folk songwriting, evident in his Gulf Coast gigs and commitment to Louisiana stories, continuing to perform in the greater New Orleans area.[1][2]
