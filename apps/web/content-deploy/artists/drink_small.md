## Biography
Drink Small, born January 28, 1933, in Bishopville, South Carolina, to sharecropper parents Alice 'Missie' Small and Arthur Jackson, grew up in a musical family amid the cotton fields. At age eight, a severe accident with a mule-drawn wagon left him with a back injury, ending his fieldwork and redirecting him to music; he taught himself guitar by ear from radio broadcasts, sang in his high school glee club and church, and formed the local gospel group Six Stars while performing with the professional Golden Five at house parties. After briefly studying barbering at Denmark Area Trade School, he abandoned it for music, joining the gospel group The Spiritualaires in 1955 in Columbia, South Carolina, where they recorded on Vee-Jay, performed at the Apollo Theater, and toured with Sam Cooke, The Staple Singers, and The Harmonizing Four.[1][2][3][4]

Transitioning to secular blues in the late 1950s, Small debuted with the 1959 single 'I Love You Alberta' on Sharp Records, drawing from eclectic influences like gospel, Piedmont blues, Delta and Chicago blues, boogie-woogie, R&B, Tennessee Ernie Ford, Merle Travis, John Lee Hooker, Fats Domino, and Blind Boy Fuller, blended with his basso profundo voice and charismatic storytelling stage presence. Known as the Blues Doctor, he built a following among college students in the Carolinas during the 1960s, performing at clubs, roadhouses, and nearly every South Carolina college, while releasing albums on small labels like his own Bishopville Records (started in the 1970s) and writing hundreds of songs, including bawdy tracks like 'Tittie Man.' He toured nationally and internationally, appearing at Chicago Blues Festival, King Biscuit Blues Festival, New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, and three World's Fairs, issuing six albums from 1990-2008.[1][2][4]

Despite his longevity, Small supplemented music income by selling fishing worms and never achieved financial success solely from performing, famously quipping about his blues stemming from lacking money. Named best gospel guitarist by Metronome in the 1950s and a National Heritage Fellow, he taught music seminars in South Carolina, preserving Piedmont blues heritage until losing his eyesight in 2014, leaving a legacy as a versatile Blues Doctor.[1][4]
