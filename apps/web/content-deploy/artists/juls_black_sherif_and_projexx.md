## Biography
Juls (Julian Nii Ayitey Adjin Nicco-Annan, born 25 October 1985) is a British-Ghanaian record producer, DJ, and musician born in Hackney, East London, to Ghanaian parents who immigrated in the late 1970s. Raised in Hackney and Stevenage, Hertfordshire, he earned a bachelor's degree and Master of Finance from the University of Surrey. Juls began producing music around 2010, gaining recognition with tracks like 'Feel Alright' for Show Dem Camp in 2012 and the cult hit 'Bankulize' with Mr Eazi in 2013. His style blends Afrobeats with influences from Amapiano, live instrumentation like saxophone, and nods to Afrobeat pioneers such as Fela Kuti, as heard in projects like his 2017 debut album *Leap of Faith* and EP *Happy Place* (2020). He has won Producer of the Year at the Ghana Music Awards UK and AFRIMA in 2017.[3][4][5]

Black Sherif (Mohammed Ismail Sherif, born 9 January 2002), formerly Blacko, hails from Konongo Zongo, a mining community in Ghana's Ashanti Region. A Muslim with a lifelong passion for music, he started at age 17, taking a gap year after high school to pursue it, auditioning unsuccessfully for shows like *Mentor X* and *MTN Hitmaker*. His 2019 debut 'Cry For Me' and 2020's 'Money' built momentum, but 'First Sermon' (2021) and its Burna Boy remix 'Second Sermon' propelled his drill-influenced, confessional style addressing ghetto survival and hustle themes. Breakthrough hit 'Kwaku the Traveller' (2022) topped charts in Ghana and Nigeria; albums include *The Villain I Never Was* (2022) and *Iron Boy* (2025).[1][2][4][6]

Projexx is a Ghanaian artist frequently collaborating with Juls, described as 'like family' in their joint work, including the 2025 single 'Timing' which previews Juls' sophomore album. Together with Black Sherif, they form a collaborative trio in Afrobeats and hiplife scenes, as reflected in their shared Spotify track listing genres of lovers rock and hiplife with popularity 7. Their partnership highlights Juls' production role bridging UK-Ghanaian sounds with emerging talents.[7]
