## Biography
The Valentinos, originally known as the Womack Brothers, were a family R&B group formed in Cleveland, Ohio, consisting of brothers Friendly Womack Jr., Bobby Womack, Harry Womack, Curtis Womack, and Cecil Womack. Their musical journey began in the early 1950s when their father, Friendly Womack Sr., a pastor, discovered their singing talent around 1952 after young Bobby filled in on guitar during a church service. The brothers initially performed gospel music at their father's church and recorded their first single, 'Buffalo Bill,' in 1954 under the name Curtis Womack and the Womack Brothers for the Pennant label when Curtis and Bobby were just ten years old. In 1956, they were discovered by Sam Cooke while he was touring with the Soul Stirrers, leading to their signing with Cooke's SAR Records in 1960 after relocating to California.[1][2][3][5]
