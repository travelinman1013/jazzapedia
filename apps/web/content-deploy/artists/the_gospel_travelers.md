## Biography
The Gospel Travelers are a contemporary gospel group formed in 2003 in San Jose, California by Deacon George Pierce and led by Reverend Milton "Bill" Johnson. Despite their relatively recent formation, the group quickly gained recognition as one of the country's most exciting and inspiring contemporary gospel ensembles. Reverend Johnson, born to a poor family in rural Arkansas, endured significant hardships throughout his life, leaving school at age 11 to pick cotton and not learning to read until age 61. After touring the South as a gospel singer in his youth, Johnson eventually moved to California where he raised six children while working as a mattress hauler, crediting gospel music as his spiritual solace throughout his struggles. The Gospel Travelers have toured extensively throughout the southern United States and performed in churches, clubs, and festivals across the Bay Area, including appearances at the All Faiths Gospel Festival. The group celebrates their contributions to Northern California's gospel music scene as one of the region's hardest-working gospel ensembles.
