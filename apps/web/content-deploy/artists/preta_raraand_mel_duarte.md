## Biography
Preta Rara & Mel Duarte is a Brazilian musical collaboration between rapper **Preta Rara** and spoken word poet **Mel Duarte**, blending rap, spoken word, and **new MPB** genres, as listed on Spotify with a popularity score of 10. Mel Amaro Duarte, born on November 19, 1988, in São Paulo, Brazil, began writing at age 8 and entered the literary scene in 2006 through São Paulo saraus. A graduate in Social Communication, she shifted from TV production and advertising to full-time poetry, slam, and cultural production, highlighted by her 2016 debut in the FLIP opening sarau and becoming the first woman to win the Rio Poetry Slam at FLUP[1]. Preta Rara, a prominent rapper from São Paulo's peripheral scene, is known for her socially engaged lyrics addressing racism, feminism, and peripheral culture, with collaborations like the 2012 track 'Tarja Preta' featuring Negra Jack[3].

Their partnership fuses Preta Rara's raw rap with Mel Duarte's poetic declamation, exemplified in Mel's 2019 spoken word album *Mormaço – Entre Outras Formas de Calor*, which includes rap and musical elements though specific Preta Rara involvement is unconfirmed in sources[1]. Mel's career includes books like *Negra Nua Crua* (2016), addressing Black women's struggles, pleasure, and political resistance, with an audiobook and Spanish edition *Negra Desnuda Cruda* (2018); she also organizes Slam das Minas and was part of Poetas Ambulantes collective[1]. Preta Rara contributes to Brazil's conscious rap scene, performing in freestyle programs and focusing on Black female voices[4].

The duo represents resistance through art, with Mel's TEDx appearances (2016-2017) and advertising campaigns (e.g., Itaú #VaiGarota 2018), amplifying their cultural impact in Brazil's urban poetry and hip-hop communities[1]. Their work leaves a legacy in promoting Black women's narratives amid limited mainstream recognition.
