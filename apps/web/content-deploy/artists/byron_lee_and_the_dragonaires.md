## Biography
Byron Lee and the Dragonaires, a pioneering Jamaican band in ska, calypso, and soca, were formed around 1950 by Byron Lee and friend Carl Brady while they were students at St. George's College in Kingston, initially playing mento to celebrate football victories. Byron Lee, who taught himself bass on a homemade instrument, turned professional by 1956, performing on Jamaica's hotel circuit and backing American stars like Harry Belafonte, Chuck Berry, and Fats Domino. Their debut recording 'Dumplings' was produced by Edward Seaga, who introduced them to ska in 1962; the band embraced it, releasing hits like 'Fireflies' and appearing in the James Bond film *Dr. No*, helping establish Jamaica's musical identity beyond American R&B.[1][2][3]

The Dragonaires evolved through the 1960s, performing at the 1964 New York World's Fair as backing for artists like Jimmy Cliff and Millie Small, though facing challenges blending with other acts. They shifted toward calypso after touring Trinidad, collaborating with Mighty Sparrow on *Only a Fool* (1966) and *Sparrow Meets the Dragon* (1969), and recording rocksteady and early reggae albums. In 1968, Lee purchased WIRL studios from Seaga, renaming it Dynamic Sounds—the first multitrack studio in Jamaica—where they produced tourist-oriented covers and hits. By the 1970s-80s, they focused on soca and carnival music, scoring massive regional successes like 'Tiny Winey' (1984) with Hero and performing at Trinidad Carnival and Reggae Sunsplash.[1][2][3]

Byron Lee died of cancer on November 4, 2008, at age 73, leaving a legacy as a musical ambassador who internationalized Caribbean sounds, founded Jamaican Carnival, and earned over 120 awards across 50+ years. The band continues as The Dragonaires.[1][2]
