## Biography
Cindy Blackman Santana (born November 18, 1959) is an American jazz and rock drummer whose career spans over four decades of virtuosic musicianship. She began her professional journey as a street busking performer in New York City during the 1980s, where she immersed herself in the jazz tradition by learning directly from legendary drummers including Art Blakey, Elvin Jones, Tony Williams, and Max Roach. Her early work as a bandleader produced the critically acclaimed album *Arcane* (1988) on Muse Records, featuring an all-star ensemble with Joe Henderson, Kenny Garrett, and Wallace Roney, establishing her as a sound innovator capable of bridging jazz and rock idioms.

Blackman's career trajectory shifted significantly in the early 1990s when she auditioned for Lenny Kravitz's band, an engagement she initially thought would last two weeks but extended to 17 years (1992-2007, with returns in 2014-2015). During this period, she performed on Kravitz's massive 1993 hit "Are You Gonna Go My Way" and toured globally through multiple world tours and hit albums. In spring 2010, she began performing with Carlos Santana as a fill-in drummer, and the professional chemistry quickly evolved into personal connection. Carlos Santana proposed to her onstage during a concert in Tinley Park, Illinois in July 2010, and they married in Maui, Hawaii on December 19, 2010. Since 2016, she has been Santana's full-time touring drummer and has appeared on multiple Santana studio albums including *Power of Peace* (2017), *In Search of Mona Lisa* (2019), *Africa Speaks* (2019), and *Blessings and Miracles* (2021).

Throughout her career, Blackman has maintained an active presence as a bandleader and collaborator, releasing tribute albums to her primary influence Tony Williams—*Another Lifetime* (2010) and *Spectrum Road* (2012)—while continuing to perform and record with artists spanning jazz, rock, and world music traditions. Her artistry is characterized by technical mastery, spiritual depth, and an ability to create sophisticated musical communication across diverse stylistic contexts.
