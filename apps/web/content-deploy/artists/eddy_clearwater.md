# EDDY CLEARWATER

## Biography
Eddy 'The Chief' Clearwater, born Edward Harrington on January 10, 1935, in Macon, Mississippi, to mixed African-American, Cherokee, and Choctaw ancestry, grew up surrounded by blues, gospel, and country music on his family's farm. He taught himself to play guitar left-handed and upside down at age 13 after moving to Birmingham, Alabama in 1948, where he performed with gospel groups like the Five Blind Boys of Alabama. In 1950, at his uncle Houston's invitation, he relocated to Chicago, working days as a dishwasher while immersing himself in the West Side blues scene, mentored by Magic Sam and influenced by artists like Muddy Waters, Sunnyland Slim, Earl Hooker, and Chuck Berry.

Clearwater, initially performing as Guitar Eddy, debuted with his 1958 single 'Hill Billy Blues' under the name Clear Waters—a playful nod to Muddy Waters suggested by manager Jump Jackson—on his uncle's Atomic H label. He built a steady career through the 1950s-1970s on Chicago's club circuit, blending searing West Side blues with rock 'n' roll in his self-defined 'rock-a-blues' style, marked by flamboyant shows, room-filling vocals, and slashing left-handed guitar. Successful with North Side college crowds, he toured Europe in the 1970s with Buddy Guy and Junior Wells, released his debut LP 'The Chief' in 1980 on Rooster Blues (donning a Cherokee-inspired headdress), and earned accolades including the 2001 Blues Music Award for Contemporary Blues Male Artist of the Year and a 2003 Grammy nomination for 'Rock 'N' Roll City' with Los Straitjackets.

A Chicago blues legend, Clearwater continued touring worldwide, self-producing on his Clear Tone label, and performing until shortly before his death on June 1, 2018. His legacy endures as a forceful showman comfortable in heartfelt blues or party rock, with Grammy-nominated albums and diplomatic tours like his 1987 U.S. government-sponsored Africa trip cementing his global influence.

## Fun Facts
- Clearwater performed behind a curtain due to segregation at an early gig with the Versatones in Round Lake, IL, but his talent won over the crowd, allowing him to play upfront.
- He was one of the first blues musicians to achieve success performing for Chicago's North Side college students, working 90% of gigs for white suburban audiences early on.
- His stage name 'Clear Waters' was a deliberate play on Muddy Waters, coined by manager Jump Jackson for his debut single.
- Clearwater wore a signature Indian headdress on his 1980 debut LP 'The Chief,' homage to his Cherokee heritage, and maintained a flamboyant showman persona.
