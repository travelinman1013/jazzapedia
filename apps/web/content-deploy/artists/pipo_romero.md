## Biography
Pipo Romero is a virtuoso Spanish guitarist from Cádiz, Spain, renowned for his innovative 'Spanish Acoustic Fingerstyle' approach on steel-string acoustic guitar, blending flamenco, Atlantic folk, Celtic, classical, and country influences rooted in the carnivals and musical traditions of his hometown. Hailing from southern Andalusia, Romero draws from his childhood surroundings to create cinematic compositions that fuse tradition with modernity, using techniques like live looping and percussive elements to produce rich, dynamic soundscapes[2][3][4].

Romero has released four albums, including 'Folklórico' (2017), which reached the Top 10 on World Music Charts Europe, 'Ikigai' (2022) charting on the Transglobal World Music Chart, and the upcoming 'Alborada' (2025). He has performed at prestigious venues worldwide, such as Lincoln Center (NYC), Kennedy Center (Washington D.C.), Budapest Jazz Festival, and Festival de Guitarra de Cartagena de Indias, with tours across Canada, the USA, China, and more. His composition 'Tout ou rien' for the Netflix series 'BERLIN, La Casa de Papel' earned a nomination for Best BSO song at the Spanish Academy of Music awards in 2024[2][3][5].

Now based in Madrid, Romero has established himself as one of Spain's most exciting contemporary guitarists, pushing boundaries in instrumental acoustic music while honoring Andalusian roots and global folk traditions[2][7].
