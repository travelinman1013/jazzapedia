## Biography
SALIMATA is a Brooklyn-born and raised rapper, originally from East New York, who emerged in the New York hip-hop scene with a distinctive style blending old-school lyricism, poetry, melody, and contemporary beats influenced by funk, jazz, grime, and house. She began rapping around 2015 with acapella freestyles in a Flatbush staircase, initially posting freestyles on Facebook that gained traction among her online community. Her serious pursuit started in 2019 when she first entered a studio, encouraged by peers like Mike, Niontay, and Hailee to release her debut album 'OUCH' in late 2022, a raw and aggressive project reflecting personal struggles.[1][2][5]

SALIMATA's career evolved with 'Wooden Floors' in February 2024, showcasing a smoother, more ambitious sound focused on love, dreams, and goals, followed by her latest album 'The Happening' in 2025 on MIKE's 10k Global imprint and the single '9-5' in September 2025. Now based in Marseille, France, she notes how the environment softened her sound, introducing more melody and fluidity while retaining aggression and versatility across flows and emotions. Her music stems from poetry writing during high school and a fast-food job, balancing raw vulnerability with groovy beats, and she has performed across boroughs and internationally.[1][2][4][5][6]

Known for her dynamic presence, direct lyrics, and voice tone, SALIMATA stands out in experimental hip-hop, pushing boundaries through collaborations and evolving from hardcore energy to a more present, feeling-driven style rooted in New York tradition yet fresh and versatile.[3][8]

## Fun Facts
- She started rapping acapella in a Flatbush staircase around 2015 and created her debut track 'Tasty Tunes' while working in a Dominican hair salon, which opened a new creative wave leading to 'Wooden Floors'.[1]
- Her mother plays a key role in her process; she approved 'FOIL,' a fan-favorite freestyle, predicting its success.[5]
- Initially freestyled on grime and house beats before focusing on hip-hop, and didn't grow up on the genre—Pro Era was just a Tumblr thing.[1][4]
- Relocated to Marseille, influencing a 'thawed,' softer, beachy vibe on 'The Happening' compared to her rougher New York projects.[4]
