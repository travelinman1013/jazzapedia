## Biography
Joseph Adam Mouton, known as Zydeco Joe, was born on October 25, 1943, in Lafayette, Louisiana, and raised in Carencro on a farm where his family grew cotton, corn, and potatoes. He learned to play guitar at age 13 by borrowing a Sears Silverstone model and initially performed with Rockin' Dopsie's band before briefly quitting music. Influenced by his grandmother who taught him Creole French—a language for which he was once punished in school—he later embraced it proudly in his music, blending Zydeco, Cajun, and blues styles with lyrics drawn from personal experiences like farm life and childhood segregation.[2][3][4]

Zydeco Joe returned to music with high-energy performances described as 'back porch jam' Zydeco that unites diverse crowds, playing for all races as he emphasized in interviews. He self-produced an early CD reissued in 2001 by Floyd Soileau's Maison de Soul, featuring originals like 'Mama Fred's Back Yard' (about his mother-in-law), 'Jack Rabbit' (nodding to his speedy nickname), and 'Creole Life,' alongside a Clifton Chenier cover. His powerful, gospel-influenced voice and accordion work celebrated Zydeco's communal joy, with songs receiving airplay on stations like KRVS and KVPI.[1][2]

A true original in Southwest Louisiana's Zydeco scene, Zydeco Joe's legacy lies in his heartfelt storytelling in Creole French and English, pulling people together through music reflective of his life. Though specific details on his later career are limited, his work positioned him as a late 20th-century Zydeco figure akin to stars like Clifton Chenier.[1][3]
