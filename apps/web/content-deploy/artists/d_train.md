## Biography
James 'D-Train' Williams, born January 21, 1962, in Brooklyn, New York, developed an early passion for music inspired by watching The Ed Sullivan Show, which led him to study jazz guitar. He attended Erasmus Hall High School, where he earned his nickname 'D Train' from his football team's captain due to his powerful tackles likened to a subway train, and recorded his first professional gospel album at age 15 with Timothy Wright. While collaborating with high school classmate Will Downing, Williams met keyboardist Hubert Eaves III, formerly of the R&B band Mtume, and the duo formed D Train in 1980, signing with Prelude Records after demoing their post-disco sound.

D Train's breakthrough came with the 1981 single 'You're the One for Me,' topping Billboard's Dance chart for three weeks and reaching #13 on R&B charts, followed by their self-titled debut album in 1982 featuring hits like 'Keep On' (#2 Dance, #15 R&B) and a cover of 'Walk On By.' Their style blended post-disco, funk, boogie, and R&B with electronic grooves and soulful vocals, evolving in 1984's 'Something's on Your Mind' album to include reggae and adult-oriented R&B, yielding their sole Hot 100 entry at #79 and #5 R&B. The group disbanded in 1985 after a greatest hits compilation, but Williams launched a solo career with 1986's 'Miracles of the Heart,' featuring R&B top-ten 'Misunderstanding,' often still collaborating with Eaves.

D Train's legacy endures in the post-disco era, bridging 1970s funk to 1980s synth-driven R&B, with tracks like 'You're the One for Me' remixed and covered multiple times, influencing dance and club music scenes.
