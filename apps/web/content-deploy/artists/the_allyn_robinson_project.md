## Biography
Allyn Robinson, a renowned New Orleans native and R&B drummer, began his musical journey at age 6 when he rescued a marching drum from a compost fire, igniting a passion that has spanned over 40 years. Born and raised in the Crescent City, he honed his skills playing with drum corps and school bands, starting professionally at age 16 due to his impeccable sense of time and mastery of styles from shuffles to funk, R&B, 2nd Line, and Zydeco. His signature cadence, blending 50s R&B bedrock with classic New Orleans rhythms, quickly established him as the city's best-kept secret, electrifying audiences with the heartbeat of New Orleans in his soul.[1][5]

In 1971, at age 20, Robinson landed a transformative gig with Wayne Cochran and The C.C. Riders, staying until 1975 and recording the landmark 1972 Epic Records album 'Cochran' at Columbia Studios in San Francisco. This period saw him perform alongside luminaries like Jaco Pastorius, Charles Brent, Red Rodney, Lee Thornburg, and Al Silvestri, forging high-energy soul grooves that left indelible marks on witnesses. Throughout his career, he collaborated with icons including Professor Longhair, Tab Benoit, Dr. Hook, Ernie K-Doe, Irma Thomas, Frankie Ford, Eddie Bo, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Chuck Berry, while maintaining a presence in New Orleans music scenes.[1][4]

Robinson's legacy endures through projects like his 2011 debut album and the 2013 release 'Dreams Realized, My Life In Music' with The Allyn Robinson Project—a 16-piece R&B big band tribute to Pastorius, Brent, and Cochran, featuring New Orleans finest and blending jazz, soul, funk, and R&B. Featured in Modern Drummer magazine, his influence extends via clinics teaching New Orleans drumming history from original brass bands, solidifying his role as a master preserving the city's rhythmic heritage.[1][2][3][4]
