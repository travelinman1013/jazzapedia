## Biography
Grace Beverly Jones was born on May 19, 1948, in Spanish Town, Jamaica, into a strict Pentecostal family. At age 13, she relocated to Syracuse, New York, with her siblings to join her parents, who had founded a church there. She studied theater at a local community college, rebelling against her religious upbringing by experimenting with makeup, psychedelic drugs, go-go dancing, and associating with the Hells Angels during summer stock theater in Philadelphia. At 18, she signed with Wilhelmina Models in New York and moved to Paris in 1970, where her androgynous, bold appearance led to work with designers like Yves Saint Laurent, Kenzo, and Claude Montana, and covers for Elle, Vogue Hommes, and Stern, photographed by Helmut Newton and others.[1][2][3]

In 1977, Jones transitioned to music, signing with Island Records and releasing disco albums Portfolio (1977), Fame (1978), and Muse (1979), featuring hits like 'I Need a Man' and 'La Vie en Rose.' She became a Studio 54 icon and muse to Andy Warhol. In the early 1980s, her style evolved to art pop, new wave, reggae, funk, and post-punk with albums like Warm Leatherette (1980), Nightclubbing (1981), and Slave to the Rhythm (1985, produced by Trevor Horn). Collaborations with Jean-Paul Goude (visuals) and Sly & Robbie (riddims) defined this era. She also acted in films including Conan the Destroyer (1984) as Zula and A View to a Kill (1985) as May Day.[1][2][3]

After a hiatus, Jones returned with Hurricane (2008), exploring Jamaican roots, and featured on Beyoncé's 'Move' from Renaissance (2022), earning a Grammy nomination. Her legacy as a genre-blending icon persists through her androgynous style, boundary-pushing music, and influence on fashion and pop culture.[2][3]
