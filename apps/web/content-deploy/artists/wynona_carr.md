## Biography
Wynona Merceris Carr (August 23, 1923 – May 11, 1976) was born in Cleveland, Ohio, to Beulah and Jesse Carr, and raised in a devout family. She began learning piano at age eight and by her early teens was a leading gospel singer in Cleveland, studying piano, voice, harmony, and arranging at the Cleveland Musical College (also referred to as Cleveland Conservatory of Music). She performed with Rev. Lucas' radio choir, the Turner Singers, and her family group, the Carr Sisters, and formed her own five-piece Carr Singers around 1945, touring the Cleveland/Detroit area. Tipped by the Pilgrim Travelers, she was signed by Art Rupe to Specialty Records in 1949, recording as Sister Wynona Carr with backing from Austin McCoy's combo, including hits like 'The Ball Game' (1952), a novelty gospel track comparing faith to baseball that became one of Specialty's top gospel sellers[1][2][3][4][5].

Carr transitioned to secular R&B and rock and roll in 1955 after persuading Rupe, releasing tracks like 'Nursery Rhyme Rock' and scoring an R&B hit with 'Should I Ever Love Again?' (1957). Her contralto vocals, husky and sensual, blended gospel with blues, jazz, and New Orleans-style backbeats, echoing Little Richard and others on Specialty while drawing stylistic influence from Sister Rosetta Tharpe. She teamed with Tharpe and Marie Knight for club dates in 1954 and served as organist for Rev. L.C. Franklin. Tuberculosis sidelined her from 1957-1959, ending her Specialty tenure; she briefly signed with Reprise Records in 1961 but achieved little success[1][2][3][4][5][6]. Returning to Cleveland, she performed sparingly in clubs, with the Art Foxhall band, and as a featured singer with Steve Gibson's Red Caps in 1965-1966, maintaining a low-key career until her death[1][2][3].

Carr's legacy endures as a pioneering crossover artist whose gospel work infused jazz/blues elements and whose R&B sides captured early rockabilly energy, though commercial success eluded her beyond niche hits. Genres like boogie-woogie and rockabilly define her Spotify profile (popularity 30), highlighting her role in bridging sacred and secular music[1][2][4].
