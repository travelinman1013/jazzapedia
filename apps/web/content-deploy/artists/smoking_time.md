## Biography
The Smoking Time Jazz Club is a New Orleans-based traditional jazz band formed around 2011, dedicated to reviving and refreshing the music of the 1920s and 1930s for modern audiences, swing dancers, and jazz fans. Led by vocalist Sarah Peterson, who arrived in New Orleans in 2003 and became a key figure in the city's vibrant jazz scene, the band draws deep inspiration from the city's musical legacy, including early New Orleans jazz and blues. They perform with reverence for pioneers like Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Jelly Roll Morton, Bessie Smith, and Billie Holiday, reimagining their contributions to keep these ideas relevant today.[1][2][3][5]

Over 13 years, the band has released numerous albums, including 'Mean Tones And High Notes' (2019), 'Take Your Time And Fly' (2017), and others dating back to 2011, often recorded in iconic New Orleans studios like Living Room Studios and Piety Studios. Their style blends fresh vocal interpretations by Peterson—who has evolved into a distinctive singer paying tribute to 1920s originators—with tight ensemble playing on trumpet, trombone, clarinet, saxophone, bass, drums, guitar, and banjo. Long-running weekly gigs at venues like The Maison and The Spotted Cat have fostered their cohesive sound in a city known for freelance musicians.[1][2]

The band's legacy lies in their mission to bridge tradition and innovation, earning respect for creative arrangements of classics like 'Perdido Street Blues' and 'You Made Me Love You When I Saw You Cry,' alongside hot instrumentals such as 'The Eel' and 'Trombone Slide.' They continue New Orleans' storied history of jazz preservation while attracting new listeners through consistent output and live performances.[2][5]
