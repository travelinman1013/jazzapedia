## Biography
Red Shahan, born in Bluff Dale, Texas—a small town southwest of Fort Worth—grew up on a cattle ranch in the vast desolation of West Texas, which deeply shaped his affinity for country music and its storytelling traditions. Initially considering careers in baseball, rodeo, or firefighting, he chose music instead, starting in his salad days a decade before his debut by haunting the Lubbock club circuit after attending Texas Tech. His mother taught him his first guitar chords, igniting his songwriting journey; after honing his skills in regional projects, he relocated to Fort Worth to launch a solo career.[1][2][4]

Shahan's debut album, *Men and Coyotes*, released quietly in summer 2015, introduced his somber portraits of busted boomtowns, gritty anthems, and lonesome howl, blending red dirt, Texas country, outlaw country, and alt-country with influences evoking Ryan Bingham and Hayes Carll. Grassroots success led to a booking deal with Paradigm Talent Agency and a spot on Randy Rogers’ Big Blind Management roster, culminating in showcases like the Americana Music Festival in Nashville. His 2018 sophomore album, *Culberson County* on Thirty Tigers, featured full-band production highlighting West Texas resilience, with tracks like “Water Bill” preserving classic country vibes amid modern shifts.[1][3][4][5]

Rooted in West Texas earth, Shahan's music captures wide-open spaces, rural struggles like meth culture and incarceration, and personal tensions of road life versus home, as in “Hurricane” and “Idle Hands.” A versatile troubadour who excels solo acoustic or with band, he debuted at Billy Bob’s Texas in 2021, became a father (noted as first-time to a girl, later three kids), and saw “Revolution” featured in *Yellowstone* Season 3, building a loyal audience organically while eyeing broader reach.[1][2][3][6]
