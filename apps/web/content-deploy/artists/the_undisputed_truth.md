## Biography
The Undisputed Truth was formed in 1970 by Motown producer Norman Whitfield as an experimental outlet for his psychedelic soul production style, amid shifting dynamics at Motown where artists like Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder sought greater creative control. The original lineup featured lead singer Joe Harris, formerly of The Fabulous Peps and The Ohio Untouchables (later Ohio Players), alongside Billie Rae Calvin and Brenda Joyce Evans, ex-members of The Delicates who had provided background vocals on hits like Diana Ross's 'Ain't No Mountain High Enough' and The Four Tops' 'Still Water (Love)'. Introduced to Motown by singer Bobby Taylor, the group debuted with the Top 10 hit 'Smiling Faces Sometimes' in 1971, a song originally recorded by The Temptations, showcasing their energetic performances, unusual psychedelic aesthetics with large white afros and makeup, and themes blending social commentary with funk.[1][2][3][4][5]

The group underwent significant changes in 1973 when Calvin and Evans departed due to dissatisfaction with commercial success; they were replaced briefly by Diane Evans, then the lineup expanded to five members—Joe Harris joined by Virginia 'Vee' McDonald, Tyrone 'Big Ty' Douglas, Tyrone 'Lil Ty' Barkley, and Calvin 'Dhaak' Stephenson from the Detroit funk group Magic Tones—yielding minor hits like 'Help Yourself' (#19 R&B). In 1975, following Whitfield's exit from Motown to found Whitfield Records, the group (with Harris as the constant) relocated with him alongside Rose Royce and Willie Hutch, shifting toward disco with tracks like 'You + Me = Love' (#48 Hot 100, #43 UK in 1977), though success waned as Whitfield prioritized other acts. Multiple lineup shifts occurred through the late 1970s, leading to obscurity by the early 1980s.[1][3][4][5]

In 1990, Joe Harris and Brenda Joyce Evans revived the group with Belita Woods for Ian Levine's Motorcity Records, releasing a new version of 'Law of the Land' as their final single in 1991. Known for genres like Motown and classic soul, their legacy lies in pushing psychedelic soul boundaries, influencing the evolution of Motown's sound into funk and disco despite modest chart peaks.[1][2][4]

## Fun Facts
- The group sported a striking 'psychedelic soul' look with large white afros and white facial makeup during performances.
- Their biggest hit 'Smiling Faces Sometimes' was originally intended for The Temptations but repurposed for them after fan criticism of Whitfield's control over the group.
- They achieved their only UK chart entry in 1977 with the disco track 'You + Me = Love' at #43, marking a stylistic shift from political lyrics to space-themed content.
- In the late 1970s lineup, Taka Boom (sister of Chaka Khan) briefly joined alongside Joe Harris and Tyrone Berkeley.
