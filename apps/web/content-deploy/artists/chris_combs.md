## Biography
Chris Combs is a composer, arranger, steel guitarist, and producer born on October 12, 1983, in Tulsa, Oklahoma.[1] He has established himself as a cornerstone of Tulsa's vibrant musical community, known for his work on lap steel and steel guitar across multiple genres including jazz, contemporary, and experimental music.[1] Since 2008, Combs has been a integral member of the Jacob Fred Jazz Odyssey (JFJO), one of Tulsa's most acclaimed jazz ensembles, where he has collaborated with world-class musicians including George Porter Jr., Matt Chamberlain, Jeff Coffin, Steven Bernstein, Skerik, Johnny Vidacovich, and Mike Dillon.[1]

Combs is perhaps best known for writing, arranging, and orchestrating "The Race Riot Suite" (2011), JFJO's 21st album and a long-form conceptual masterwork that tells the story of the 1921 Tulsa race riot.[1] The album reached #1 on the CMJ Jazz chart in Fall 2012 and received critical acclaim from major publications including the Los Angeles Times and The Boston Globe for its beautiful orchestration and celebration of the Greenwood community.[1] Beyond his work with JFJO, Combs released a self-titled solo album titled "COMBSY" in October 2017, which showcases influences ranging from Charles Mingus and J Dilla to Radiohead and James Blake, featuring a lush, groove-heavy sound recorded live as a trio to 2" tape.[1]

Combs has become a respected figure in Tulsa's music scene, known for his improvisational approach and collaborative spirit.[3] He has participated in numerous festival performances and tours, including appearances at the Jazz Standard in New York City, the Montreal Jazz Festival, and the High Sierra Music Festival.[1] His work exemplifies the deep creative tradition of Tulsa and his commitment to original composition and community-driven music-making.
