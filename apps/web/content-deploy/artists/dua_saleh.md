## Biography
Dua Saleh, a Sudanese-American non-binary artist, was born in Kassala, Sudan, during the Second Civil War and fled with their family at age five, first to a refugee camp in Eritrea before immigrating to the Rondo neighborhood of Saint Paul, Minnesota, in the United States. Raised in a Muslim household with Tunjur heritage, Saleh's early life was steeped in Arabic language, Sudanese poetry, spoken word traditions, and family music-making with instruments like the oud and drums. Initially aspiring to be a music journalist, Saleh turned to spoken-word poetry in high school and college, performing at open mics for Button Poetry and engaging in activism, including leading a walkout against the school-to-prison pipeline amid personal struggles with depression.

Saleh's music career emerged unexpectedly around 2017-2018, transitioning from poetry when they began singing a cappella at events and recording demos on their phone for SoundCloud. Their debut single 'First Take' (2017) led to collaboration with producer Psymun, resulting in the critically acclaimed EP *Nūr* (2019, meaning 'light' in Arabic, reflecting their gender-neutral identity), followed by *Rosetta* (2020), *CROSSOVER* (2021), and debut album *I SHOULD CALL THEM* (2024), blending alternative R&B, electronica, glitchy alt-pop, black metal, and Afro beats with themes of identity, love, sapphic desire, resistance, and environmental anxiety. Saleh gained wider recognition acting as non-binary student Cal Bowman in Netflix's *Sex Education* season three, advocating for trans and non-binary representation, and co-writing on Travis Scott's *UTOPIA* track 'MY EYES'. Their genre-defying style, poetic lyricism, and boundary-pushing fashion have earned accolades like GAY TIMES Rising Star Honor and praise as a 'genius' from Moses Sumney.

At around 30 years old, Saleh continues to evolve, with over 94 million streams across EPs, a growing global fanbase (260,000+ monthly Spotify listeners as of recent reports, now at popularity 48), and ongoing projects including new music and performances, solidifying their legacy as a pioneering Black R&B innovator from the Midwest.
