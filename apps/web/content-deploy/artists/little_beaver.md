## Biography
Willie George Hale, professionally known as Little Beaver, was born on August 15, 1945, in Forrest City, Arkansas, and acquired his distinctive nickname as a child due to his prominent front teeth. He moved to Florida as a teenager and became a virtuoso guitarist, establishing himself as a session musician for TK Records in the early 1970s. His characteristic guitar sound became integral to numerous hit recordings, most notably Betty Wright's "Clean Up Woman," and he played alongside other key Florida R&B musicians including pianist Benny Latimore and organist Timmy Thomas.

Little Beaver launched his solo career on the Cat label (an offshoot of TK Records) in 1972 with "Joey," produced by TK's senior producer Steve Alaimo. His breakthrough came in 1974 with "Party Down," which reached No. 2 on the US Billboard R&B chart and showcased his signature blend of soulful vocals with funk-infused guitar rhythms. Throughout the 1970s, he released five albums combining blues, soul, and funk elements, though his commercial momentum declined during the disco boom. His 1974 album "Party Down" notably featured bassist Jaco Pastorius (credited as Nelson "Jocko" Padron) on one track.

His recording career effectively ended in the early 1980s following TK Records' bankruptcy in 1981, though he experienced a career resurgence in 2003 when Betty Wright recruited him to play on Joss Stone's albums "The Soul Sessions" and "Mind Body & Soul." He released a new album in 2008 on the Henry Stone Music label. Little Beaver's legacy has been cemented through modern sampling and covers, with his tracks sampled by hip-hop artists including Jay-Z, Kendrick Lamar, and featured in contemporary commercials, securing his place as a pioneering figure in soul and R&B music.
