- **Origin**: Los Angeles

## Biography
Ozomatli is an American musical group formed in 1995 in Los Angeles that emerged from activist roots rather than traditional music industry pathways.[1][3] The band's members met through their affiliation with the Peace and Justice Center of Los Angeles while fighting to form a labor union for disenfranchised workers, discovering their musical talents and commonalities in the process.[1][3] Named after the Aztec god of dance, fire, and music, Ozomatli quickly became known for their frenetic live performances in Los Angeles and San Diego club scenes, earning a devoted fanbase before breaking into mainstream recognition.[1][3]

Ozomatli's debut eponymous album, released in June 1998 on Almo Sounds, made an immediate impact on the live music scene and led to touring opportunities with major artists including Carlos Santana's Supernatural tour and Mana.[2][5] The band's success was marked by critical acclaim and Grammy recognition, winning the Grammy Award for Best Latin Rock/Alternative Album in 2002 for 'Embrace the Chaos' and again in 2004 for 'Street Signs'.[3][5] Beyond their musical achievements, Ozomatli became recognized as official Cultural Ambassadors for the U.S. State Department approximately 20 years before 2025, undertaking global tours to promote unity and acceptance.[1][5]

The group's musical identity is defined by their eclectic fusion of Latin, hip-hop, rock, salsa, jazz, funk, reggae, and world music styles, representing Los Angeles's diverse cultural landscape.[2][4] Throughout their nearly three-decade career, Ozomatli has maintained their commitment to activism and social justice, advocating for farm workers' rights and immigration reform while collaborating with orchestras and performing internationally across countries including China, Tunisia, Jordan, and Burma.[4][5] The band's lineup has evolved over the years, ranging from six to ten members, but their core mission of blending musical innovation with progressive politics has remained constant.

## Fun Facts
- Ozomatli was arrested while performing outside a club in 2004; two band members and their manager were detained, but charges were eventually dropped. The band later performed at the Latin Grammy Awards where George Lopez introduced them with the joke: 'And now, a band that is very excited to learn that their performance tonight counts as community service, Ozomatli!'[3]
- Two of Ozomatli's founding members, DJ Cut Chemist and MC Chali 2na, left the band to reform and focus on Jurassic 5 after their EP gained momentum in England, with the band's understanding and support.[6]
- Ozomatli released their second album 'Embrace the Chaos' on September 11, 2001—a date when many American bands cancelled concerts—but Ozomatli continued performing while maintaining their commitment to social justice and the anti-war movement.[3]
- The band became the first band to be asked to speak at the TED Conference, where they shared their ideas about music and identities in the global age.[5]
