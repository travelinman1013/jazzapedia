## Biography
Kevin Ray Clark, born July 8, 1965, in Elizabethtown, Kentucky, grew up in a musical household where he played in a family band at church and was inspired by Disney World musicians, prompting him to pursue trumpet in school band[2][6]. His early career included stints with the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus Band before spending a decade as a staff musician at Walt Disney World in Central Florida[1][2][4]. Seeking new opportunities, he relocated to New Orleans, joining the Dukes of Dixieland as trumpeter and music director, touring worldwide and performing on riverboats and Bourbon Street alongside New Orleans legends[1][2].

Clark's career evolved with international moves, including a role as music director for Toronto's Historic Distillery District, where he led his quartet and booked entertainment, followed by brief time in Charlotte, North Carolina, before returning to New Orleans[1]. There, he became bandleader for the Dukes of Dixieland on the Steamboat Natchez and music director at Fritzel's European Jazz Pub, while also contributing to the Grammy-winning New Orleans Nightcrawlers Brass Band[1][2][7]. His style is rooted in **Dixieland**, **New Orleans Jazz**, and **post-bop**, marked by energetic brass performances in traditional jazz settings[6]. A three-time Grammy nominee and one-time winner in the Regional Roots category with the Nightcrawlers, Clark has left a legacy as a versatile bandleader preserving New Orleans jazz traditions while innovating through his own valve oil product line[2][4].
