## Biography
Robert Andre Glasper, born April 5, 1978, in Houston, Texas, grew up immersed in music through his mother, a professional blues singer, which heavily influenced his early development as a pianist. He attended the High School for the Performing and Visual Arts (HSPVA) in Houston, where he formed early musical bonds, and later studied at the New School for Jazz and Contemporary Music in New York. After graduating, Glasper quickly rose in jazz circles, working with artists like trumpeter Roy Hargrove and bassist Christian McBride, while releasing his debut album 'Mood' in 2002, followed by 'In My Element' (2007), where he began experimenting with fusion styles blending jazz, hip-hop, and R&B.[1][2][3][4][6]

Glasper's career breakthrough came with the formation of The Robert Glasper Experiment, an electric band featuring drummer Chris Dave, saxophonist/vocoderist Casey Benjamin, and bassist Derrick Hodge, debuting on the 2009 album 'Double-Booked,' which earned a Grammy nomination. The group's 2012 album 'Black Radio,' featuring neo-soul and hip-hop artists like Erykah Badu, Lupe Fiasco, Bilal, and Yasiin Bey (formerly Mos Def), was a commercial and critical smash, peaking at #15 on the Billboard 200 and winning the 2013 Grammy for Best R&B Album. Sequels like 'Black Radio 2' (2013), 'ArtScience' (2016), and contributions to Kendrick Lamar's 'To Pimp a Butterfly' (2015) and the 'Miles Ahead' soundtrack solidified his genre-defying style, fusing jazz rap, neo-soul, hip-hop, and electronic elements.[1][2][3][5][6]

Known for his dual projects—The acoustic Robert Glasper Trio (with Damion Reid and Vicente Archer) and the boundary-pushing Experiment—Glasper has earned multiple Grammys, including for 'Black Radio 2' and tracks like Kendrick Lamar's 'These Walls' (2016). He formed supergroups R+R=NOW and August Greene in 2018, hosted the Blue Note Cruise, and curates annual sold-out residencies blending tributes to Stevie Wonder and collaborations with peers like Esperanza Spalding, cementing his legacy as a bridge between jazz tradition and modern black music innovation.[1][2][3][5]
