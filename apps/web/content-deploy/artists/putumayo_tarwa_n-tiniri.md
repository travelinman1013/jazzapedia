## Biography
Tarwa N-Tiniri is a desert blues band from Ouarzazate in southeast Morocco, formed in 2012 by five childhood friends who shared a passion for their Amazigh heritage and musical expression. The band's name combines tarwa ("generation") and n-tiniri ("of the desert"), reflecting the landscapes and nomadic traditions of their region. All self-taught musicians, they began their creative journey with a homemade guitar called Lohtar, drawing inspiration from the Saharan environment and Amazigh culture that surrounded them in Merzouga, a town near the Algerian border.

The band's musical style represents a sophisticated fusion of traditional Amazigh and Gnaoua sounds with contemporary world music genres including blues, reggae, rock, and jazz. Their lyrics address themes central to desert communities—cultural identity, social pressures, friendship, and the desire for peace. Tarwa N-Tiniri achieved international recognition relatively quickly, debuting at the Transform Festival in Norway in 2018 and performing in France in 2019. They released their debut album "Azizdeg" in 2019 through Canadian label Atty Records, recorded by producers Simon Walls and Greg Bonnier in their Ouarzazate garage.

Beyond their recorded work, the band has become cultural ambassadors for Amazigh traditions, performing extensively throughout Morocco and Europe. In 2022, they collaborated with Dutch musician Thijs on the "Nomads in Music" project, which resulted in a documentary, album, and European tour that saw sold-out performances across the Netherlands. The band remains based in Merzouga, choosing to stay in their homeland despite regional youth migration, using their music as a universal language to share the stories and sounds of nomadic desert cultures with global audiences.

## Fun Facts
- The band began their musical journey with a homemade guitar called Lohtar before acquiring professional instruments, demonstrating their resourcefulness and dedication to music-making in their remote desert community.
- Their featured song 'Rokba' is inspired by al-rokba, a traditional collective sung-poetry and dance form from Morocco's Daraa Valley where men and women chant verses together while performing coordinated movements, which the band reimagined with guitars and call-and-response vocals.
- When Tarwa N-Tiniri announced their first performances in the Netherlands, they were uncertain about audience reception, but were amazed to find that all scheduled theatres were sold out, with audiences giving them standing ovations after each concert.
- The band deliberately chose to remain in Merzouga, their hometown near the Algerian border surrounded by the Sahara, despite regional youth migration, because they found the quiet desert environment to be inspirational and the perfect place to create and rehearse their music.
