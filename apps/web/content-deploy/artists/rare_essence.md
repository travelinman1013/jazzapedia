# Rare Essence

## Biography
Rare Essence is a pioneering **go-go** band from Washington, D.C., formed in 1976 by a group of friends from St. Thomas More Catholic School in Southeast D.C., initially under the name **Young Dynamos**.[1][2][3][6] The early core included drummer Quentin “Footz” Davidson, guitarist/vocalist Andre “Whiteboy” Johnson, bassist Michael “Funky Ned” Neal, trombonist John “Big Horn” Jones, and later vocalist James “Jas Funk” Thomas, who helped front the band.[1][2][3][6] Guided in their formative years by strict, supportive parents and local mentors, they cut their teeth playing recreation centers and neighborhood gigs, jamming on 1970s funk and soul by Parliament-Funkadelic, Cameo, Earth, Wind & Fire, and other Top 40 acts before fully embracing the emerging go-go sound created by Chuck Brown.[1][2][3][4][6]

As the group renamed itself Rare Essence and entered its teen years, it became a staple of the D.C. “Metro Go-Go circuit” across D.C., Maryland, and Virginia, known for marathon, high-energy shows that often ran into the early morning hours.[1][2][4] They refined a percussion-heavy, groove-based style built on Brown’s “pocket” feel, but expanded it with extended vamps, call‑and‑response, and later elements of **hip‑hop, Latin, rock, and R&B**.[2][3][4] The band weathered extensive lineup changes, the crack-era violence that plagued D.C. club culture, and the tragic early deaths of several members, yet remained one of the region’s most popular live acts.[2][4] In the late 1980s and 1990s they released key recordings and regional hits such as “Work the Walls,” “Lock It,” “Overnight Scenario,” “Body Snatchers,” and the album **“We Go On and On,”** which reflected on the band’s tumultuous history and evolving sound.[2][3][4]

Over more than four decades, Rare Essence has been celebrated as “**the wickedest band alive**,” drawing multi‑generational audiences and helping to define go-go as a distinct D.C. cultural identity.[3][4][6] They became a crucial training ground for musicians including future Grammy-winning artist **Meshell Ndegeocello**, and have collaborated with hip‑hop and R&B figures such as Doug E. Fresh, Snoop Dogg, Sean “Puffy” Combs, and CeeLo Green, helping bridge go-go with mainstream Black popular music.[3][4] Despite never achieving sustained national chart dominance, Rare Essence’s relentless live presence, festival appearances (including the Smithsonian Folklife Festival and Richmond Folk Festival), and continued activity under original members Andre “Whiteboy” Johnson and Jas Funk have cemented their legacy as one of Washington, D.C.’s most important and enduring bands.[1][3][4][5][6]


## Fun Facts
- Rare Essence began as a group of elementary and high school students at St. Thomas More Catholic School in Southeast Washington, first performing under the name **Young Dynamos** before adopting the Rare Essence moniker within a few months.[1][2][3][6]
- Several members’ mothers, sometimes referred to collectively as “no‑nonsense moms,” closely supervised the band’s early activities and rehearsals, helping keep the young musicians focused and organized as they navigated D.C.’s club scene.[1]
- The band purchased an old police precinct in 1981 and converted it into their own practice studio and home base, a move that symbolized both their professionalism and their embeddedness in D.C. neighborhood life.[2]
- Rare Essence shows became legendary for running until 5 a.m. or later, with stacked, seamless sets that rarely stopped, reinforcing go-go’s reputation as a live, continuous-party music.[1][2]
