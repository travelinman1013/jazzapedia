## Biography
Rob Clearfield, born on November 12, 1984, in Oak Park, Illinois, grew up immersed in diverse musical environments including garage bands, gospel choirs, and South American guitar ensembles. He pursued formal studies at the Chicago College of Performing Arts at Roosevelt University, where he became deeply embedded in Chicago's vibrant jazz scene, residing in the city for fifteen years before relocating to Marseille, France, where he now lives as a native.[2][7] His early career featured founding the prog-rock group District 97 and indie rock band Hood Smoke, alongside sideman roles with prominent artists such as Patricia Barber, Howard Levy, Makaya McCraven, and Matt Ulery.[2]

Clearfield's musical style blends jazz with indie-rock and improvisation, evident in his six bandleading albums: debut releases with Information Superhighway, followed by instrumental works like The Long and Short of It (2013) and Islands (2016), and solo piano albums A Thousand Words (2010) and Wherever You’re Starting From (2018).[2] He has composed for theater productions at Purdue University since 2007, song cycles for Grace Commons (2008-2012), the short film The Lost Remake of Beau Geste (2013), and an orchestral debut with the Brazos Valley Symphony Orchestra in 2019.[2] A key collaboration is with drummer Quin Kirchner, highlighted in their duo album Concentric Orbits and prior projects like Kirchner's The Shadows and the Light (2020).[2][4]

Quin Kirchner, born December 14, 1981, in Chicago, Illinois, began drumming under educator Don Skoog, expanding into Afro-Cuban traditions with studies in Havana, and earned a B.A. in Jazz Studies from the University of New Orleans under mentors like Ellis Marsalis and Jason Marsalis.[3] Post-Hurricane Katrina, he completed a Master's at Manhattan School of Music with John Riley before returning to Chicago, where he became a prolific sideman and leader, releasing albums like The Other Side of Time and The Shadows and the Light (2020), drawing influences from Elvin Jones, Sun Ra, and Charles Mingus.[3] Together, Clearfield and Kirchner represent Chicago's dynamic jazz legacy through their longstanding partnership.[1][3]
