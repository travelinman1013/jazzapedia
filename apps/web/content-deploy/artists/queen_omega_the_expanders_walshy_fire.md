## Biography
Queen Omega, born Jeneile Osborne around 1981 in San Fernando, Trinidad and Tobago, grew up in a musical family immersed in soul, jazz, calypso, and soca, performing in local talent shows from age nine and providing backing vocals for soca acts under producer Kenny Phillips[1][2][4]. Her spiritual shift to Rastafari, inspired by Emperor Haile Selassie I, redirected her focus to roots reggae and dancehall; a trip to Jamaica in 2000 led to meeting producer Mickey D, resulting in her relocation to London and debut self-titled album in 2001, followed by Pure Love (2003) and Away From Babylon (2004) with the Green House Family label[1][2][3]. She became a trailblazer for female roots reggae artists through powerful live performances at events like Rebel Salute (2004) and tours across Europe, North America, and Brazil, later releasing albums like Destiny (2005), Servant of Jah Army (2008), Together We Aspire, Together We Achieve (2012), and Freedom Legacy (2023)[2].

Relocating briefly to Dominica during her teens deepened her Rastafarian connection and adoption of the stage name 'Queen Omega,' symbolizing her independent, fervent defense of the faith[3][4]. After a period raising four children, she resumed touring and recording, including collaborations blending traditional reggae with modern influences addressing social issues and women's empowerment[1][3]. Her career highlights include the 2012 Merlin Lynn Taitt Award and consistent global performances[1].

The query references 'Queen Omega, The Expanders, Walshy Fire,' likely indicating a collaborative project; Walshy Fire (Major Lazer MC) and Los Angeles roots reggae band The Expanders released tracks like those on the Piece of Love Riddim and a joint YouTube feature with Queen Omega, showcasing her ongoing cross-genre connections[6][7][8].

## Fun Facts
- Earned her stage name 'Queen Omega' from community elders who saw her as a strong, independent Rastafarian woman defending the faith with fire, embodying the 'omega female' archetype[3].
- Temporarily stepped back from music to become a 'baby making factory,' raising four children, and insists they learn to read, write, and play music before joining her tours—skills she never formally acquired[1][3].
- Paid tribute to her mother on the song 'Mama' for encouraging her early talent show entries at age nine, where she wrote calypsos and rapped on national TV[1].
- Performed at the Caribbean Music Expo in Jamaica with the Solomon Band in 2000, sparking her international career[1].
