## Biography
Margie Perez was born in Washington, DC, to Cuban immigrant parents from Havana, growing up in the suburbs immersed in classic rock like the Beatles and New Wave from the 1980s, alongside Cuban rhythms from artists such as Johnny Pacheco and Celia Cruz. She worked as a travel agent for many years, fueling her wanderlust with visits to nearly every continent, before entering music in her late 20s as a backup singer for the original rock band Then There Were None, where she contributed background vocals collaboratively. Relocating to New Orleans, Louisiana, she transitioned from non-musical careers, including teaching, to full-time singing with various local bands.

In New Orleans, Perez established herself as a versatile singer-songwriter blending **funk, blues, Latin, pop**, and a distinctive New Orleans funky touch, earning recognition from Offbeat Magazine as 'one of the hardest working musicians in New Orleans.' She leads her self-titled band performing original music on Frenchman Street and serves as lead singer for the Latin big band **Muévelo** (up to 11 pieces), as well as the smaller **Margie Perez and Her Grupo Latino**. Her career spans clubs, festivals, private parties, and collaborations across genres like jazz, Afro-Cuban with Moyuba, and work with artists such as Stanton Moore, Dr. Michael White, and Leo Nocentelli.

Perez's legacy thrives in New Orleans' vibrant scene, where her wide vocal range and genre versatility make her a sought-after performer and collaborator, embodying the city's musical mutualism by fairly compensating bandmates and climbing success over 16+ years without leaving others behind.
