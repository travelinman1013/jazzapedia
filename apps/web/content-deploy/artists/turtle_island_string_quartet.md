## Biography
The Turtle Island String Quartet was founded in 1985 in the San Francisco Bay Area by violinist David Balakrishnan, who conceived the idea during his master's degree program at Antioch University West. Balakrishnan, inspired by innovative string music scenes, collaborated with fiddler Darol Anger, cellist Mark Summer—who had recently moved from the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra—and violist Laurie Moore, one of Balakrishnan's improvisation students. Their debut performance featured Balakrishnan's compositions alongside jazz arrangements like Bach chorales transitioning into 'All of Me' and Miles Davis' 'So What,' establishing their signature fusion of classical chamber music with jazz, folk, bluegrass, swing, bebop, funk, R&B, rock, hip-hop, Latin American, and Indian influences.[1][2]

## Fun Facts
- Named after Native American creation mythology referring to North America as 'Turtle Island,' reflecting their melding of American musical traditions.[1][4]
- Yo-Yo Ma praised them as 'a unified voice that truly breaks new ground – authentic and passionate – a reflection of some of the most creative music-making today.'[2][5]
- Many members, including Irene Sazer, Jeremy Cohen, and Mads Tolling, switched instruments (from violin to viola) specifically to join the group.[1]
- Revived 200-year-old improvisational chamber traditions from Haydn's era, treating string players like modern jazz saxophonists and keyboardists.[2]
