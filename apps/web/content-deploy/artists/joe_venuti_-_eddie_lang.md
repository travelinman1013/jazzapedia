## Biography
Joe Venuti and Eddie Lang were pioneering jazz musicians from South Philadelphia who revolutionized the role of string instruments in jazz during the 1920s and early 1930s. Both sons of Italian immigrants, Venuti (Giuseppe "Joe" Venuti, born 1903) and Lang (born Salvatore Massaro, 1902) met in elementary school as violin students at James Campbell School in Bella Vista, Philadelphia's Italian-American neighborhood. They became inseparable friends and musical partners, honing their craft through extensive practice sessions and classical training before discovering jazz after World War I. Beginning their professional partnership around 1918 with Chick Granese's band, they quickly became in-demand studio and session musicians, moving to New York in 1925 where they achieved widespread recognition.

Venuti is considered the father of jazz violin, pioneering the use of string instruments in jazz ensembles at a time when violins and guitars were uncommon in the genre. Lang became the first jazz and blues guitar virtuoso, essentially creating the modern guitar method in the 1920s that remains in use today. Together, they refined a distinctive sound through recordings as a duo and with their Blue Four, Five, and Six combos—contemporaries of Louis Armstrong's Hot Fives and Hot Sevens. Their most famous composition, "Stringing the Blues" (recorded in late 1926), exemplifies their sparkling rapport and became one of their trademark tunes. Despite contrasting personalities—Lang was a serious introvert while Venuti was an extroverted practical joker—their musical chemistry was undeniable, blending dazzling virtuosity with raucous humor. Their partnership ended tragically when Lang died in 1933 at age 30 from complications following a tonsillectomy. Venuti continued his distinguished career into the 1970s and experienced a significant revival in the late 1960s, but his most enduring work was created during his partnership with Lang.
