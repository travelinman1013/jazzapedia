## Biography
Born Lee Audrey Nelms in Houston's Fifth Ward, Trudy Lynn grew up immersed in the city's vibrant blues and R&B scene during the late 1950s. Surrounded by music from an early age, she sang gospel at the Fifth Ward Church of Christ, performed on her family's front porch with her father—a distant cousin of Lightnin' Hopkins who played harmonica and tap-danced—and sneaked peeks at stars like Big Mama Thornton and Jackie Wilson at local clubs. Influenced by LaVern Baker, Elvis Presley, and soul artists, she formed the vocal group Chromatics in high school, modeled after the Supremes, and received her big break at 17 when Albert Collins invited her onstage at Walter’s Lounge to sing 'Money,' igniting her professional passion.[1][2][4]

After high school graduation in 1965, Lynn adopted her stage name in Lufkin, Texas, where she landed her first gig, then joined saxophonist Leo Baxter’s orchestra and Clarence Green’s Rhythmaires big band, performing jazz, blues, and soul across Texas military bases. Marrying bassist Ozell Roberts at 20, she balanced motherhood to three children with relentless club work in Houston, opening for Ike and Tina Turner and recording her debut single 'Long Live the Blues' in 1973. Divorced by the late 1970s, she gigged steadily at Third Ward venues while running her mother’s hair salon, but national recognition came in the late 1980s when Ichiban Records signed her, leading to her debut album *Trudy Sings the Blues* (1989) and subsequent releases like *Come to Mama* (1990) and *24 Hour Woman* (1994), establishing her as a blues-soul powerhouse with a voice blending barroom growl, uptown sass, and emotional depth.[1][2][3][4][5]

Returning to Houston in the early 2000s, Lynn partnered with Connor Ray Music, releasing albums like *Royal Oaks Blues Cafe* (2013) and *Blues Keep Knockin’* (2018), amassing 13 studio albums, one live record, and four compilations. A staple on the European festival circuit—including Notodden and Lucerne Blues Festivals—and U.S. events like Monterey, she remains a Houston blues pillar, drawing from life's trials like divorce and her youngest son's death to fuel her gutsy, heartfelt performances hailed as those of the 'Divine Diva of Blues and Soul.'[1][2][3][8]
