## Biography
Henrietta Yurchenco (1916-2007) was a pioneering ethnomusicologist, radio producer, and folk music advocate born in New York, where she began her career in late 1939 at WNYC. She produced programs featuring American folk music and global sounds, working closely with Lead Belly on his radio show, scripting episodes, and arranging debut New York radio appearances for Pete Seeger and Woody Guthrie. Scouting ethnic communities for talent, she brought diverse musicians to air during a time when such recordings were scarce. She authored Woody Guthrie's first biography and books like 'A Fiesta of Songs from Latin America and Spain' (1966) and her autobiography 'Around the World in 80 Years: A Musical Odyssey' (2003).[1][3]

In the late 1950s and 1960s, Yurchenco hosted shows on WBAI and WNYC, including 'Adventures in Folk Music,' and collaborated with folklorists like Alan Lomax and Charles Seeger. From 1966 to 1987, she taught ethnomusicology at City College, New York, offering hands-on workshops on global instruments and styles while opposing academic bureaucracy. Politically active since the 1930s, she engaged in anti-Vietnam War efforts and lifelong protests, promoting peace songs. Retiring as Professor Emerita, she remained an inspiring figure for students.[1]

Yurchenco's legacy lies in bridging folk music with social history, producing recordings like 'Lead Belly and Woody Guthrie: Live on WNYC 1940' and documenting traditions from Pre-Columbian Mexico to Sephardic Morocco. Her zeal persisted into her later years with the Down Home Radio Show, emphasizing music's reflection of societal principles.[1][3]
