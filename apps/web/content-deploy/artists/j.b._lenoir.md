## Biography
J. B. Lenoir was born on March 5, 1929, on his family's farm near Monticello, Mississippi, where his full given name was simply 'J. B.'—not initials. He learned guitar from his father, who introduced him to Blind Lemon Jefferson's music, a major early influence, and later drew inspiration from Arthur Crudup and Lightnin' Hopkins. In the early 1940s, he worked with Sonny Boy Williamson II and Elmore James in New Orleans, and lived in Gulfport, Mississippi, before moving to Chicago in 1949, where Big Bill Broonzy mentored him and connected him to the blues scene, performing with artists like Memphis Minnie, Muddy Waters, and Little Walter.[1][2][3][4][6]

In Chicago, Lenoir became a key figure in the 1950s blues scene, recording for labels like J.O.B., Chess, Parrot, and Checker, often misspelled as 'Lenore.' Known for his high-pitched vocals, showmanship in zebra-patterned costumes, and electric guitar style, he scored a hit with 'Mamma Talk to Your Daughter' (1954, peaking at #11 on Billboard R&B), alongside tracks like 'The Mojo Boogie' (with J.T. Brown on sax) and socially charged 'Eisenhower Blues' (re-recorded as 'Tax Paying Blues'). His band J.B. and his Bayou Boys featured Sunnyland Slim, Leroy Foster, and Alfred Wallace. In the 1960s, he explored African percussion with 'J.B. Lenoir and his African Hunch Rhythm' (1963), and Willie Dixon produced acoustic sessions with Fred Below, including 'Alabama Blues' and 'Down in Mississippi,' addressing civil rights, racism, poverty, and the Vietnam War—rare for blues at the time.[1][2][4][6]

Lenoir toured Europe with the American Folk Blues Festival in 1965, gaining acclaim for his political songwriting that distinguished him from peers. Tragically, he died on April 29, 1967, at age 38 from injuries in a car accident. His legacy endures as an influential songwriter and guitarist whose bold social commentary inspired later rock and blues artists.[1][2][5]
