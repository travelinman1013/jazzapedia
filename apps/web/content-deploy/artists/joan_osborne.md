## Biography
Joan Elizabeth Osborne was born on July 8, 1962, in Anchorage, Kentucky, a suburb of Louisville. She did not pursue music professionally until the early 1990s, after relocating to New York City in the late 1980s to study filmmaking at New York University. Her musical career began unexpectedly when, after a few drinks at an open mic night at the Abilene Café, she performed Billie Holiday's classic "God Bless the Child." This impromptu performance inspired her to begin regularly appearing at open mic events around New York City, where she developed her distinctive hybrid of blues, soul, and rock music while writing original songs.

In 1991, Osborne founded her own independent record label, Womanly Hips Records, and released her first full-length album, *Soul Show: Live at Delta 88*. She built a devoted regional following by touring the Northeast before signing with Mercury Records in 1993 under producer Rick Chertoff. Her major label debut, *Relish* (1995), became a massive commercial and critical success, selling three million copies and earning seven Grammy nominations. The album's lead single, "One of Us" (written by Eric Bazilian), became an international hit, reaching number one on the U.S. singles chart for two weeks and establishing Osborne as a significant voice in 1990s popular music.

Throughout her career spanning over twenty-five years, Osborne has recorded and performed across multiple genres including rock, pop, soul, R&B, blues, and country. Her discography includes original albums such as *Love and Hate* (2014) and *Nobody Owns You* (2023), as well as numerous cover albums celebrating blues, soul, and rock classics. She has collaborated with legendary artists including The Grateful Dead, Phil Lesh and Friends, the Dixie Chicks, and Luciano Pavarotti. From 2012 to 2018, she was a member of the rock band Trigger Hippy. Osborne currently resides in Brooklyn, New York, and continues to perform internationally in clubs, theaters, arenas, and stadiums.

## Fun Facts
- Osborne's breakthrough came almost a year after her album's release—'One of Us' became a massive MTV and radio smash nearly 12 months after *Relish* was initially released in March 1995, demonstrating the song's remarkable staying power.
- She directed the music video for *Relish*'s second single 'St. Teresa' and created the artwork for the album's physical package, showcasing her multifaceted creative talents beyond singing.
- Osborne was a co-headliner for the Lilith Fair in 1997, one of the most significant all-female music festivals of the 1990s, and played a prominent role in the 2002 film 'Standing in the Shadows of Motown,' performing with the legendary Motown house band the Funk Brothers.
- She performed at the Grand Ole Opry in February 2007, marking a significant milestone in her career as she expanded her reach into country music circles.
