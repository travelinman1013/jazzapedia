## Biography
Michael Dease was born in Augusta, Georgia, where he initially played the saxophone and trumpet before discovering his passion for the trombone at age 17, teaching himself the instrument as a high school senior. In 2001, he moved to New York City to join the historic first class of jazz students at The Juilliard School, earning both Bachelor's and Master's degrees while quickly establishing himself as a brilliant soloist, sideman, and bandleader. His early career saw him recording four critically acclaimed albums as a leader—*The Takeover* (2005), *Clarity* (2007), *Dease Bones* (2008), and *Grace* (2010)—and contributing to over 100 sessions as a sideman before age 30.[1][3][5]
