## Biography
Pinkney 'Pink' Anderson (February 12, 1900 – October 12, 1974) was born in Laurens, South Carolina, and raised in nearby Greenville and Spartanburg. Self-taught on guitar, he began performing as a street singer for pennies and joined a local African American string band in Spartanburg around age 8. In 1914 (or 1917 per some accounts), he became a 'draw man'—singer, dancer, guitarist, and comedian—for Dr. W.R. Kerr's (or Frank Kerr's) Indian Remedy medicine show, touring the Southeast for decades while entertaining crowds to sell dubious remedies. He occasionally worked with other medicine shows, including those led by Leo 'Chief Thundercloud' Kahdot.[1][2][3][5][6]

Anderson's sole 1920s recording came in 1928 with his mentor Simmie Dooley for Columbia Records in Atlanta, cutting four sides including 'C. and O. Blues'; he declined a solo follow-up to stay loyal to Dooley, not recording again until 1950. Folklorists captured him at the Virginia State Fair (Paul Clayton) and later at home (Samuel Charters in 1961-1962), releasing Bluesville albums like *Carolina Blues Man*, *Medicine Show Man*, and *Ballad & Folksinger, Vol. 3*. His style blended **Piedmont blues**, ragtime, country blues, folk ballads, and medicine show tunes, often unaccompanied with humorous, subversive lyrics about local life, jails, and greens. He appeared in the 1963 film *The Bluesmen* and played folk venues during the blues revival, though health issues limited him.[1][2][4][5][6]

Heart problems and a stroke forced retirement from the road by 1957, after which he ran an illegal drink house and craps game in Spartanburg. Anderson's journeyman career exemplified Carolina blues traditions without stardom, influencing later musicians through rediscovery. He died of a heart attack in Spartanburg at age 74.[1][3][6]

## Fun Facts

- Syd Barrett named Pink Floyd by combining Anderson's name with bluesman Floyd Council.
- Anderson performed as a dancer and comedian in medicine shows, not just musician, entertaining crowds for snake oil sales.
