## Biography
Esperanza Emily Spalding, born on October 18, 1984, in Portland, Oregon, grew up in a single-parent household and discovered music early, starting as a violinist before switching to upright bass as a teenager, performing in local clubs across pop, rock, hip-hop, and jazz styles.[1][2][3] She earned a scholarship from the Boston Jazz Society in 2005 and transferred to Berklee College of Music, graduating in three years at age 20, immediately becoming one of the youngest instructors there, teaching bass performance.[1][2][4] Her career launched with the 2006 album *Junjo* on Ayva Musica, followed by her self-titled *Esperanza* (2008) on Heads Up, which fused jazz with soul, hip-hop, Cuban, and Brazilian influences, topping Billboard's Contemporary Jazz chart.[1][2][3]

Spalding's breakthrough came with *Chamber Music Society* (2010), featuring her originals and standards with a string trio and guests like Milton Nascimento, peaking at number 34 on the Billboard 200 and earning her the 2011 Grammy for Best New Artist—the first for a jazz musician, beating pop acts like Justin Bieber.[1][2][4][5] Subsequent albums like *Radio Music Society* (2012), with collaborators including Joe Lovano and Jack DeJohnette, won Best Jazz Vocal Album; the funk-rock *Emily's D+Evolution* (2016) co-produced by Tony Visconti; limited-edition *Exposure* (2017); *12 Little Spells* (2019), another Best Jazz Vocal winner; and *Songwrights Apothecary Lab* (2021), also Grammy-winning.[1][2][5] Her style blends vocal jazz, jazz fusion, world music (Brazilian, Cuban), pop, and funk, often multilingual in English, Spanish, and Portuguese.[1][2][3]

Spalding's legacy includes five Grammy Awards, a Boston Music Award, a Soul Train Music Award, honorary doctorates from Berklee and CalArts, and a professorship at Harvard in 2017; she performed at the White House and Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, and continues innovating through teaching and projects emphasizing practice journals for students.[1][2][3][4]
