## Biography
Rick James, born James Ambrose Johnson Jr. on February 1, 1948, in Buffalo, New York, began his musical journey in his teenage years, playing guitar, bass, and drums in various local bands and jazz groups. To avoid the Vietnam draft, he joined the U.S. Naval Reserve but deserted, moving to Toronto in 1964 where he formed the rock-soul band The Mynah Birds, featuring Neil Young, which signed with Motown in 1966. After his arrest for desertion and brief imprisonment, James relocated to California and Detroit, working as a songwriter for Motown acts like The Miracles and The Spinners under pseudonyms, while forming groups like The Main Line.[1][2][3]

James achieved breakthrough success in 1977 with the Stone City Band, signing to Motown's Gordy Records and releasing his debut album *Come Get It!* in 1978, featuring R&B hits 'You and I' and 'Mary Jane.' His 1981 masterpiece *Street Songs* solidified his stardom with 'Give It to Me Baby' and 'Super Freak,' blending funk, disco, rock, and new wave into a signature 'punk-funk' style marked by infectious grooves, powerful vocals, and rock attitude. Albums like *Bustin' Out of L Seven* and *Fire It Up* followed, with James producing for others and touring with openers like Prince and Teena Marie, though later releases saw declining sales.[1][2][3]

James's legacy endures through his production work, mentorship of acts like the Mary Jane Girls, and cultural impact, notably MC Hammer's 1990 Grammy-winning 'U Can't Touch This' sampling 'Super Freak.' A pioneer fusing funk with rock and influencing gangsta rap via tracks like 'Ghetto Life,' he remained Motown's key 1980s star until personal struggles overshadowed his later career.[1][2][3]
