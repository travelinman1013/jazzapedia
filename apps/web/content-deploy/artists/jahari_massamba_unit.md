## Biography
Jahari Massamba Unit is a jazz duo formed by multi-instrumentalist and producer Madlib (Otis Jackson Jr.) and drummer/producer Karriem Riggins, originating from their collaborations in the hip-hop and jazz scenes. They first met at a club jam years ago and began regularly crossing paths over 20 years ago at Los Angeles parties like The Do-Over in 2005, where they traded beat CDs, leading to early joint projects. Their debut as Jahari Massamba Unit came in 2007 with contributions to Madlib's Yesterday’s Universe: Prepare for a New Yesterday (Volume 1), followed by tracks on High Jazz in 2010, though the duo remained relatively dormant until officially forming with the 2020 release of Pardon My French.[1][2][9]

The duo's creative process involves Riggins sending drum recordings—often jazz grooves captured at studios like Sunset Sound—and Madlib layering instrumentation on bass, synthesizer, piano, flutes, vibraphones, and more, blending live playing with production techniques. This chameleonic style fuses nu jazz, instrumental hip-hop, bebop influences, and experimental elements, evident in albums like the critically acclaimed Pardon My French (2020) and YHWH Is Love (2022), which feature diverse tracks from grooves and covers to high-vibration, spiritually inspired pieces referencing French culture, wines, and sophisticated chaos.[2][6][7]

Jahari Massamba Unit represents an evolution of Madlib's fictional jazz universe (e.g., Yesterday’s New Quintet, Yesterdays Universe), showcasing their virtuosic musicianship beyond beatmaking. Their work emphasizes dynamics, turning loops into sculpted songs that channel positive, medicinal energy inspired by God, continuing a legacy of jazz-hop innovation that influences contemporary artists.[2][4]

## Fun Facts
- The duo's creative exchange began with Riggins handing Madlib a CD of 20-30 jazz drum patterns at The Do-Over parties, receiving an eight-song response a week later, evolving from beat CDs to Dropbox folders with 50 ideas exchanged reciprocally.[2]
- Riggins recorded drums for the project at Sunset Sound Studios' Studio 3, the same room Prince used from 1983-1991, chosen for its intuitive vibe even without mics.[2]
- Pardon My French features song titles entirely in French referencing wines and locations, subverting expectations with crass humor amid sophisticated nu-jazz chaos.[6]
- Jahari Massamba Unit emerged from Madlib's fictional 'Yesterdays Universe' jazz projects, initially blurring lines between real and invented bands like Monk Hughes & The Outer Realm.[2]
