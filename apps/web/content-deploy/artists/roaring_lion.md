## Biography
Hubert Raphael Charles, later known as Rafael de Leon and professionally as Roaring Lion, was born on February 22, 1908, in Trinidad. From a young age, he showed talent in poetry and music, beginning his calypso career around 1927 in Port-of-Spain calypso tents after winning a competition that earned him his stage name for his powerful vocal style. Despite humble origins, he cultivated a refined, sharply dressed persona, becoming known for extemporizing lyrics on any subject and playing the clarinet; he was uniquely literate in musical notation among early calypsonians.[1][3][5][6]

Roaring Lion's career skyrocketed in the 1930s, marking the Golden Age of Calypso. In 1933, he won a prize at Victory Tent and toured cruise ships; by 1934, he recorded in New York with Atilla the Hun for Brunswick, producing nearly 100 singles by 1941 for Brunswick and Decca, including hits like 'Mary Ann,' 'Netty Netty,' and 'Ugly Woman.' He innovated calypso duets and dramas, performed for US President Franklin Roosevelt (coining 'Trinidad, the land of calypso'), at Carnegie Hall, and pioneered cruise-ship entertainment. He continued recording through the 1950s, toured Europe including an eight-month stint in Amsterdam in 1952, and contributed songs for events like King George VI's coronation and WWII. Returning to Trinidad in 1963 post-independence, he performed in major tents and recorded into the 1990s with soca elements while preserving classic style.[1][2][3][4]

Regarded as calypso's elder statesman and historian, Roaring Lion authored 'Calypso From France to Trinidad: 800 Years of History' in 1986, controversially claiming French origins for the genre. He mesmerized global audiences until largely retiring by the late 1970s, passing away in 1999 in Trinidad, buried under a roaring lion statue. His prolific output and international promotion solidified calypso's worldwide appeal.[1][2]
