## Biography
Vesna Pisarović, born on April 9, 1978, in Brčko, Bosnia and Herzegovina (then Yugoslavia), grew up in Požega, Croatia, where she immersed herself in music from an early age. She attended music school, learning flute, singing in choirs, and competing in contests, later experimenting with punk rock as a teenager. Holding a degree in phonetics and linguistics from the University of Zagreb, she moved to Zagreb in the mid-1990s, performing in clubs and writing songs. Her meeting with composer Milana Vlaović at Zadarfest in 1997 marked a key step, leading to her pop breakthrough with albums like *Da znaš* (2000) and *Za tebe stvorena* (2001), achieving gold and platinum sales across former Yugoslavia.[1][2][3]

In 2002, Pisarović won Croatia's Dora festival, representing the country at the Eurovision Song Contest with 'Everything I Want,' finishing 11th and sparking debate for being performed entirely in English. She released further pop albums including *Peti* (2005) and wrote 'In the Disco' for Bosnia and Herzegovina's 2004 Eurovision entry. A pivotal encounter with free jazz artist Peter Brötzmann in Berlin inspired her shift to jazz; she studied at the Royal Conservatory in The Hague and earned a Master's in performance at London's Guildhall School of Music and Drama. Her jazz debut *With Suspicious Minds* (2012) was followed by *Naša velika pjesmarica* (2016) and *Petit Standard* (2019), blending improvisation with collaborators like Greg Cohen, Tony Buck, and others. Now based in Berlin, she explores sevdah traditions in her 2025 album *Poravna*.[1][2][3][6]

Pisarović's career reflects a dramatic evolution from pop stardom to avant-garde jazz, marked by expressive vocal freedom and cultural reconnection, with over 2,000 unpublished music sheets signaling ongoing creativity amid pandemic-delayed comebacks.[2][3]
