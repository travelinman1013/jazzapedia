## Biography
Jason William Marshall Sr., born in Washington, D.C. and raised in Silver Spring, Maryland, discovered his passion for music at age nine in fourth grade when he chose the saxophone. His first teacher was Lorenz Wheatley, who provided early musical direction, followed by experiences at music camp where he switched from alto to baritone saxophone in sixth grade. Marshall pursued formal education with an undergraduate degree from The New School and a master's from the Aaron Copland School of Music, developing a style rooted in African-American music traditions, blending straight-ahead jazz with soul, R&B, and funk. Influenced by baritone saxophonists like Leo Parker, Nick Brignola, and Bruce Johnstone, he cultivated a giant, soulful sound through dedicated study.[1][6][8]

Arriving in New York City in 2003, Marshall quickly established himself as a premier baritone saxophonist in the bebop tradition, performing with the Thad Wilson Jazz Orchestra, Bluesman Roy Gaines, and notably Roy Hargrove's RH Factor and Roy Hargrove Big Band, including a memorable debut at the Playboy Jazz Festival at age 20. He leads his own groups, such as Overt Negritude (debut album 2007), the Jason Marshall Organ Trio, and the Jason Marshall Big Band, and has composed and arranged for ensembles like the Taipei Jazz Orchestra and New Orleans Jazz Orchestra. Nominated for a Grammy for his work on 'Miss Garvey, Miss Garvey!!', he also performs with Nickel & Dime Ops and has shared stages with icons like Aretha Franklin, Beyoncé, and the Roots.[1][3][4][6][8]

Beyond performance, Marshall is a respected jazz educator, clinician, and thought leader, offering workshops worldwide and speaking on jazz, Afro-American history, classic menswear, and travel. He authored 'Elegance at Altitude' in 2015, a guide for traveling musicians, and continues to base his work in New York City and Margate, Florida, emphasizing music's role in community wellness and cultural restoration.[1][7][8]
