## Biography
Ween is an American alternative rock band formed in 1984 in New Hope, Pennsylvania by Aaron Freeman (Gene Ween) and Mickey Melchiondo (Dean Ween), who met in a junior high school typing class. Freeman recalled their initial connection: "We didn't like each other. He was a jock, and I was more of a trench-coat guy. But we sat next to each other in typing class and both realized we were into music." The band's name was a combination of the words "wuss" and "penis," reflecting their irreverent approach to music from the beginning. For their first decade, Ween performed as a duo with Freeman on lead vocals and occasional rhythm guitar and Melchiondo on lead guitar and backing vocals, backed by a Digital Audio Tape machine providing pre-recorded backing tracks. Their earliest material was deliberately obnoxious and drug-fueled, with Melchiondo later describing the music as "designed to be obnoxious."

Ween's career trajectory evolved significantly through the 1990s and 2000s. After being signed to Twin/Tone Records in 1989 by A&R representative Dave Ayers (who became their manager), the band released several lo-fi cassettes before expanding their live lineup in 1994 with drummer Claude Coleman Jr. and bassist Andrew Weiss, who also became a prolific producer for the band. They signed to Elektra Records and released several studio albums including *Chocolate and Cheese* (1994), *Chocolate and Cheese* (1994), *The Mollusk* (1997), and *White Pepper* (2000), before moving to independent labels for *Quebec* (2003) and *La Cucaracha* (2007). Despite their eclectic catalog spanning funk, psychedelia, soul, country, gospel, prog, R&B, heavy metal, and punk rock, Ween never achieved mainstream recognition but developed a devoted cult following and critical acclaim.

After a 28-year run, Freeman quit the band in 2012 to focus on his alcohol and drug addiction recovery. Ween reformed in late 2015 and toured extensively without recording new material, but entered an indefinite hiatus in 2024 citing Melchiondo's mental health concerns.
