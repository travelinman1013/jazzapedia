## Biography
Choro das 3 is a Brazilian instrumental group formed by three sisters from the state of São Paulo who specialize in *choro*, a 19th‑century genre that became a foundation for Brazilian popular music.[1][5][7] The group centers on Corina (flute and piccolo), Lia (7‑string guitar), and Elisa (mandolin, clarinet, banjo, piano, and accordion), who began playing together as children under the guidance of their parents in the countryside town of Porto Feliz, São Paulo.[4][6] Their late father, Eduardo Roque da Silva Ferreira, a pandeiro player, founded the band with them and was an integral member for 19 years until his death from COVID‑19 in 2021, after which the sisters chose to continue the project in his honor.[2][4][5][6]

The group’s origins are closely tied to Corina’s early fascination with choro: as a child she heard an album by legendary flutist Altamiro Carrilho, which inspired her to study recorder and later transverse flute, planting the seed for a family ensemble dedicated to Brazilian instrumental music.[1][6] Encouraged by a volunteer music teacher at Corina’s public school and supported by their parents’ decision to move closer to music study opportunities, the sisters deepened their training and soon began performing around São Paulo.[1][6] Initially called “Balaio de Gato,” they eventually adopted the name Choro das 3 and, in 2008, released their debut album *Meu Brasil Brasileiro* on major label Som Livre, produced and recorded in their own studio and blending classic choros such as “Aquarela do Brasil,” “Carinhoso,” and “Tico‑tico no fubá” with original compositions like Elisa’s “Bolinha de Gude.”[1][4]

Over the following years Choro das 3 became recognized as one of Brazil’s leading choro ensembles, winning the Prêmio Adoniran Barbosa and being named Best Group of Popular Music by the São Paulo Association of Art Critics, while also appearing on national television, playing for Brazilian presidents, and performing for massive audiences such as São Paulo’s New Year’s Eve celebration.[3][4][5][7] Their discography has grown to at least eleven albums, including *Escorregando* (2012), which pays tribute to composers like Ernesto Nazareth, Chiquinha Gonzaga, and Anacleto de Medeiros, and later releases such as *Boas Novas* (2013) and *Boca de Goiaba* (2014), which focus on contemporary compositions and incorporate rhythmic elements from baião, frevo, and other Brazilian and international styles.[1][5] Parallel to their Brazilian success, they have toured internationally—especially in the United States and Europe—using intricate arrangements, virtuosic playing, and a strong sense of family identity to introduce global audiences to choro while expanding the genre’s boundaries with influences from jazz, bluegrass, fado, chamamé, forró, and classical chamber music.[3][4][5][8]

## Fun Facts
- Before becoming Choro das 3, the family originally performed under the name “Balaio de Gato” (“Basket of Cats”) and only adopted their current name shortly before releasing their debut album.
- Their first major concert opportunity came when the United States Consulate in São Paulo booked them, which helped launch their professional career beyond local performances.
- The debut album *Meu Brasil Brasileiro* was recorded, produced, and mixed by the sisters themselves in their home studio, an unusual level of self‑production for such young artists on a major label.
- Following the death of their father and percussionist Eduardo from COVID‑19 in 2021, the sisters chose to continue as a trio and now dedicate every performance to his memory, explicitly framing the band as a living tribute to him.
