## Biography
The Original Pinettes Brass Band, the world's only all-female brass band, was founded in 1991 at St. Mary's Academy, a historically Black Catholic girls' school in New Orleans East, Louisiana, by band director Jeffery C. Herbert. Initially comprising about 16 students from the school's marching band, the group was named 'Pinettes Brass Band' as a feminization of Herbert's own Original Pinstripe Brass Band. Under his direction, they shifted from traditional New Orleans-style jazz to contemporary brass band music, inspired by groups like Rebirth Brass Band, performing at the school's 1992 spring concert to enthusiastic response. Herbert continued managing the band after leaving St. Mary's in 1993 for John McDonogh High School and later Southern University in 1998, at which point leadership transitioned to the members themselves.[1][2][3][5][7]

The band faced significant challenges, including high member turnover and the devastation of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, which scattered members across the U.S., particularly to Houston. Bandleader Christie Jourdain, originally a snare drum alternate, reformed the group by recruiting new members from diverse New Orleans schools like Eleanor McMain, McDonogh 35, Warren Easton, and Xavier University Preparatory. A dispute with former members led to their name change to The Original Pinettes Brass Band. Their breakthrough came in 2013 when they won the Red Bull Street Kings competition against three male brass bands, dubbing themselves 'Street Queens,' and released their debut full-length album *Finally*. Their style blends New Orleans second-line brass traditions with modern influences, earning performances at Essence Festival, French Quarter Fest, Jazz Fest, and international gigs in Turkey and Switzerland.[1][2][3][6][7]

The band's legacy endures as a pioneering force elevating women in New Orleans' male-dominated brass scene, fostering a sisterhood among multigenerational members from varied backgrounds. They have opened for Arcade Fire at Voodoo Fest (2021) and Essence Festival consistently since 2012, collaborated with Mia X at French Quarter Fest 2024, and maintain a dream of global performances to showcase music's universal language.[1][2][3]
