## Biography
James Edward 'Jimmy' Yancey, born around February 20, 1894 or 1898 in Chicago, Illinois, began his career as a child performer, touring vaudeville circuits as a singer and dancer from age five, including a command performance for King George V in England in 1913. Largely self-taught on piano with some instruction from his brother Alonzo, whose father was a professional singer and guitarist, Yancey returned to Chicago around 1915, performing at house parties, rent parties, speakeasies, and small clubs while playing semi-professional baseball and later working as a groundskeeper for the Chicago White Sox from 1925 until near his death.[1][2][3][5][6]

Yancey's musical style pioneered boogie-woogie with slow, steady left-hand bass patterns featuring rhythmic unpredictability and inventiveness in the right hand, often ending pieces in E flat regardless of starting key; he influenced the genre's development despite not recording until 1939, when he cut 'The Fives' and 'Jimmy’s Stuff' for Solo Art, followed by his first solo album for Victor. Though not flashy, his earthy, subtle playing contrasted the genre's typical speed, incorporating ragtime strains and habanera influences, and he occasionally sang blues like 'Death Letter Blues.' Post-1939, he gained wider recognition, appearing on CBS radio, at New York's Ross Tavern and Carnegie Hall in 1948 with Mama Yancey (his wife Estella), and at Chicago's Bee Hive club.[1][2][3][4][7]

Yancey, dubbed a father of boogie-woogie, taught many pianists while holding his day job until diabetes and a stroke sidelined him; he recorded for Paramount in 1950 and Atlantic in 1951 before dying of a stroke on September 17, 1951, in Chicago, honored with a jazz funeral. His 'Yancey Special' bass became a staple, shaping blues and early rock.[1][2][3][6]
