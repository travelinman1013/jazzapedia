## Biography
Troy 'Trombone Shorty' Andrews, born January 2, 1986, in New Orleans' Tremé neighborhood, began performing music at age four, earning his nickname because he was shorter than his trombone; he debuted onstage with Bo Diddley that year and played with an adult band at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival the following year. By age six, he led his own group, the Tiny Toones Brass Band, performing for tips in Jackson Square, and as a teenager, he joined the Stooges Brass Band while studying at the New Orleans Center for Creative Arts (NOCCA), where he honed his skills in trombone, trumpet, and more.

After graduating high school in 2005, Andrews joined Lenny Kravitz's band for the Electric Church World Tour, gaining high-profile experience and building his reputation amid Hurricane Katrina's aftermath, which elevated him as a New Orleans ambassador. He formed Trombone Shorty & Orleans Avenue around age 19, blending New Orleans brass band traditions, jazz funk, second-line rhythms, rock, hip-hop, and R&B; key albums include Backatown (2010), For True (2011), Say That To Say This (2013), and Parking Lot Symphony (2017), which topped the Billboard Jazz chart. His style reveres tradition while innovating, as seen in collaborations like re-recording The Meters' 'Be My Lady' with its original members.

Andrews' legacy includes the Trombone Shorty Foundation (est. 2011), providing instruments, the Trombone Shorty Music Academy, and Shorty Fest to nurture young musicians, alongside partnerships like the Fredman Music Business Institute with Tulane University. He has released eight albums, earned a Heinz Award in Arts and Humanities, and remains a leading figure in modern New Orleans music.
