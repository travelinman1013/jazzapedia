## Biography
Cindy Blackman Santana, born November 18, 1959, developed an early passion for drumming after moving to Bristol, Connecticut at age 11, where she attended the Hartt School of Music and discovered jazz through Max Roach at 13, receiving her first professional drum set at 14. She studied at Berklee College of Music under Alan Dawson, who taught her idol Tony Williams, but left after three semesters in 1982 following a gig recommendation with The Drifters, relocating to New York City to launch her professional career.[7] Her recording career began in the late 1980s, leading the acoustic Cindy Blackman Quartet and electric ensembles, with standout albums like Works On Canvas (2000), praised for its impressionistic suite and her role as rhythmic engine and colorist.[1]

Blackman Santana's career bridges jazz and rock, marked by collaborations with jazz luminaries like Pharoah Sanders, Ron Carter, Sam Rivers, Cassandra Wilson, Angela Bofill, Buckethead, Bill Laswell, and Joe Henderson, and rock icons. She drummed for Lenny Kravitz from 1992-2007 and 2014-2015 across world tours and hit albums, starting with an impromptu audition for 'Are You Gonna Go My Way.'[1][7] In 2011, she formed Spectrum Road with Vernon Reid, Jack Bruce, and John Medeski to honor Tony Williams' music.[4] Since filling in for Santana in 2010, she joined full-time in 2016, contributing to albums like Power of Peace (2017), In Search of Mona Lisa (2019), Africa Speaks (2019), and Blessings and Miracles (2021), while marrying Carlos Santana in 2010 after meeting at a European festival.[1][3][6]

Renowned as a sound innovator, Blackman Santana blends nuanced colors and soulful power in her playing, pushing creative boundaries across genres. Her legacy includes leading bands, tribute performances like the 2010 Miles Davis 'Bitches Brew' at festivals, and endorsements with Gretsch Drums and Istanbul 'Om' cymbals, establishing her as a versatile virtuoso.[1][5]
