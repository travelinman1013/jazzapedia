## Biography
Charles Edward 'Chuck E.' Weiss (March 18, 1945 – July 20, 2021) was born in Denver, Colorado, where his parents owned The Record Center, exposing him early to diverse music through their collection and local venues like Ebbetts Field. As a teenager, he took up drumming and impressed blues legend Lightnin' Hopkins during a gig, leading to tours where he performed with icons such as Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, Willie Dixon, Dr. John, and Roger Miller. In the early 1970s, Weiss played in the house band at Ebbetts Field, befriending Tom Waits, and worked as a DJ on KFML-FM-Denver before relocating to Los Angeles.[1][2][3]

Weiss became a fixture on the LA music scene, blending blues, beat poetry, rock and roll, New Orleans dirge jazz, electric country-blues, zydeco, and what he called 'twisted jungle music.' His first credited releases were on Tom Waits' records, and he gained fame as the subject of Rickie Lee Jones' 1979 hit 'Chuck E.'s in Love.' He released his debut album *The Other Side of Town* in 1981, followed by *Extremely Cool* (1999, co-produced by Waits), *Old Souls & Wolf Tickets* (2001), and *23rd & Stout* (2006), showcasing collaborations with Waits, Tony Gilkyson, and others. Weiss played extended residencies at clubs like The Central, which he helped revive as the Viper Room with Johnny Depp.[1][3]

Known for his boozy attitude, jive poetry, and aversion to air travel, Weiss cultivated a cult following among Hollywood socialites through Sunset Strip house bands. His authentic, risk-taking style left a legacy as one of LA's coolest Americana voices, though he later embraced a more settled life with cats, sports, and routine.[1][3]

## Fun Facts
- Weiss once bragged to a chinchilla-coated, platform-shoe-wearing self about knowing blues legends while dismissing Tom Waits as 'just some bum folk singer' at Ebbetts Field coffee shop.[3]
- He famously quipped, 'I always wanted to sing like a black man and do business like a Jew. Instead, I sing like a Jew and do business like a black man.'[3]
- Weiss avoided air travel, staying tied to LA and Southern California, where his Sunset Strip house band gigs built his Hollywood cult status.[1]
- His debut album *The Other Side of Town* (1981) was unusually short at just 24 minutes across eight tracks, produced by a team linked to Joe Cocker.[1]
