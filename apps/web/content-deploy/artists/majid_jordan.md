## Biography
Majid Jordan is a Canadian R&B duo formed in 2011 by vocalist Majid Al Maskati, born October 22, 1990, in Bahrain, and producer Jordan Ullman, born September 8, 1993, in Toronto, Ontario. They met at Majid's birthday party in Toronto while both attending the University of Toronto, where they bonded over music and began producing tracks in Jordan's dorm room, releasing their first single 'Hold Tight' anonymously on SoundCloud just days later. Working from dorms and Jordan's parents' basement, they dropped their debut EP *Afterhours* under the pseudonym Good People, which caught the attention of Noah '40' Shebib, leading to their signing with OVO Sound, Drake's label imprint under Warner Records.[1][2][3]

Their career breakthrough came in 2013 when they co-produced and featured on Drake's hit 'Hold On, We're Going Home' from *Nothing Was the Same*, which charted globally and earned multiple award nominations and wins. They released their OVO debut EP *A Place Like This* in 2014, followed by their self-titled full-length album *Majid Jordan* in 2016, featuring 'My Love' with Drake. Their sound blends smooth R&B vocals with atmospheric production, drawing from Toronto's music scene, and they announced their first North American tour that year.[1][2][4]

Majid Jordan has earned accolades including Much Music Video Awards wins for 'Forever,' 'My Love' (with Drake), and 'Every Step Every Way,' alongside nominations at iHeartRadio, Billboard, Juno, and Soul Train Awards. Their legacy includes elevating OVO Sound's R&B roster and influencing the atmospheric, emotive style in modern R&B through collaborations with major artists.[1][2]
