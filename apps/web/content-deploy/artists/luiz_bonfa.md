## Biography
Luiz Floriano Bonfá (1922–2001) was a Brazilian guitarist, composer, and singer born near Guanabara Bay in Rio de Janeiro to an Italian immigrant father. Receiving his first guitar at age eleven, he quickly showed prodigious talent and began classical guitar studies with Uruguayan master Isaias Savio. By his late teens, Bonfá performed in Rio's nightclubs, hotels, and casinos, absorbing samba, choro, bolero, waltz, and jazz influences. He started composing early hits like 'Ranchinho de Palha' and 'O Vento Não Sabe,' recorded by Dick Farney in the 1950s, and by 1946 was a Radio Nacional performer, blending classical precision with Brazilian rhythms in a samba-canção style.[1][3][4][6]

## Fun Facts
- Bonfá contributed to the stageplay version of Orfeu da Conceição before the 1959 film Black Orpheus, composing and recording its earlier soundtrack.[2]
- His iconic 'Manhã de Carnaval' was initially not liked by director Marcel Camus but became a global bossa nova classic.[4]
- In 1959, sound engineer Emory Cook recorded Bonfá's unguarded solo performance in Rio, later released as Solo in Rio 1959 with previously unavailable material.[4]
- Bonfá's guitar style was brassier and more solo-oriented than João Gilberto's rhythm-focused approach, often playing polyphonically like Wes Montgomery.[5]
