## Biography
The Savoy Bearcats were an eleven-piece jazz band that served as a pioneering house ensemble at the legendary Savoy Ballroom in Harlem, New York. Originally formed in Charleston, South Carolina, probably in late 1925 under the name 'Charleston Bearcats' by pianist Duncan Mayers, the band was renamed the Savoy Bearcats when they became the house band at the Savoy Ballroom's opening on March 12, 1926. They were the first African American Harlem big band to be recorded by the RCA Victor Talking Machine Company, establishing themselves as significant figures in the early jazz recording era. The band's tenure at the Savoy lasted approximately one year, during which they performed alongside other notable ensembles including Fess Williams and his Royal Flush Orchestra and guest appearances by Fletcher Henderson's orchestra.

Under the leadership of Leon Abbey, the Savoy Bearcats featured talented musicians including trumpeters Gilbert Paris and Demas Dean, trombonist James Reevy, and a versatile reed section. After leaving the Savoy in 1927, the band embarked on an extensive and successful tour of South America under the name 'Leon Abbey and his Orchestra,' performing from May 1927 through the end of that year. The ensemble continued to exist until at least 1932, maintaining their presence in the jazz scene at various venues. The band's musical approach combined strong ensemble polyphony with secure musicianship, establishing a foundation for the swing era that would follow.
