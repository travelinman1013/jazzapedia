## Biography
Crys Matthews is a Nashville-based singer-songwriter recognized as a leading voice in social justice music, blending Americana, folk, blues, bluegrass, and country into performances rooted in traditional melodies and honest, original lyrics that amplify unheard voices and promote equity and justice. Rhiannon Giddens, born February 21, 1977, is an acclaimed American musician, multi-instrumentalist, and composer who began her career in string bands like Sankofa Strings and Gaelwynd before co-founding the Grammy-winning Carolina Chocolate Drops in 2005, reclaiming Black contributions to old-time music. A two-time Grammy winner, 2023 Pulitzer Prize recipient, and MacArthur 'Genius' grant honoree, Giddens has expanded into solo albums, opera, ballet, film scores, and her role as Artistic Director of Silkroad, consistently centering overlooked histories in American music.

The Resistance Revival Chorus, formed after the 2017 Women's March, is a collective of over 60 women and non-binary singers from diverse backgrounds including touring musicians, actors, activists, and educators, dedicated to infusing joy into resistance efforts, uplifting women's voices—especially Black women and women of color—and addressing marginalization in the music industry. They perform at major venues like Carnegie Hall while engaging in street activism for causes like Black Lives Matter, reproductive rights, and climate justice, with their album 'THIS JOY' highlighting their mission.

These artists converged in 2024 for a reimagining of Peggy Seeger's 'How I Long for Peace,' discovered by Matthews via a Library of Congress video, adapted with gospel influences from her church upbringing, and recorded with Giddens and the Chorus to promote peace and civic engagement ahead of National Voter Registration Day.
