## Biography
Los Tambores de Bejucal is a traditional Cuban percussion ensemble that serves as the musical backbone of the Charangas de Bejucal festival, one of Cuba's oldest and most celebrated popular celebrations. The group accompanies the festivities that originated in 1830, when enslaved people were temporarily freed on December 24 to participate in religious and cultural celebrations in the town of Bejucal, located 20 kilometers south of Havana. The ensemble represents the continuation of African musical traditions that were preserved through the cabildo system—societies that maintained African languages, customs, beliefs, and musical practices despite colonial restrictions.

## Fun Facts
- The two competing groups in the Charangas de Bejucal were originally mockingly called 'Musicanga' (disgusting music of poor taste) by Spanish rulers and Creoles, who then formed their own competing group called 'Malayos' (red roosters) to participate in the festivities.
- The rivalry between the two groups became so central to the festival that the competition itself—rather than the original religious ceremonies—became the main event, with groups now constructing parade floats as large as 20 meters with elaborate lights and decorations.
- The festival represents a unique fusion of African, Spanish Catholic, and Creole cultures, where racial and class differences were transcended through musical competition, with group membership eventually determined by personal preference rather than social status.
