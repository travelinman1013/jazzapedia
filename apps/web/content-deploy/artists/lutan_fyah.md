## Biography
Anthony Martin, professionally known as Lutan Fyah, was born on December 4, 1975, in Spanish Town, Saint Catherine Parish, Jamaica. Exposed to music from an early age, his African consciousness and spiritual identity were deeply influenced by his grandfather Tamba and rooted in Rastafarian Bobo Ashanti teachings. Before fully committing to music, Martin pursued architecture studies at the University of Technology and played professional football for Constant Spring F.C., ultimately choosing music as his lifetime calling in 1999 when he adopted the stage name Lutan Fyah.

Lutan Fyah's career began with recordings for Buju Banton's Gargamel Records, establishing him as a conscious reggae and dancehall artist dedicated to messages of love, peace, and unity. Over his career spanning more than two decades, he has recorded approximately 300 singles and released 16 studio albums, collaborating with renowned producers including Grammy winners Sly and Robbie, and working across multiple international labels from Jamaica, the USA, and the UK. His distinctive style combines youthful exuberance with strict Rastafarian discipline, earning him recognition across Africa, the Americas, and European markets.

Lutan Fyah has established himself as a prolific touring artist, headlining shows in over 30 countries and performing at major international festivals. His tenth studio album, Life of a King (2013), was followed by extensive European and African tours. He has received multiple international awards including recognition from the International Reggae and World Music Awards (IRAWMA) for Best Artist and Most Consistent Cultural Artist. His YouTube presence alone has generated over one million views, and he maintains a substantial following across social media platforms.
