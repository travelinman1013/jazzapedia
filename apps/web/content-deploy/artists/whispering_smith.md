## Biography
Moses 'Whispering' Smith, born on January 25, 1932, in Union Church, Mississippi (with some sources noting Brookhaven, MS), was an American blues harmonicist and singer known for his work in the swamp blues genre. In his mid-20s, he relocated to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where he began performing in local clubs, honing his skills as a powerful singer and straightforward harmonica player. His early career in the 1960s involved playing harmonica on recordings by prominent swamp blues artists, establishing him within Louisiana's vibrant blues scene.[1][2][7]

Smith's solo recording career took off under producer J.D. 'Jay' Miller in Crowley, Louisiana, with releases on Excello Records. Key singles included 'Mean Woman Blues,' 'Don't Leave Me Baby,' 'Cryin' Blues,' and instrumentals like 'Live Jive' and 'Hound Dog Twist.' His style was characterized by unsophisticated yet effective harmonica work and robust vocals, though his emergence coincided with the decline of swamp blues popularity. He released his final solo album, *Over Easy*, in 1971 on Blue Horizon, and toured Europe in 1973 with American Blues Legends '73, contributing tracks like 'Texas Flood' to the compilation.[1][2][3]

Despite limited commercial success, Smith's contributions earned him induction into the Louisiana Blues Hall of Fame. He passed away on April 28, 1984, in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, at age 52, leaving a legacy in Louisiana and swamp blues through his recordings and collaborations.[1][2]
