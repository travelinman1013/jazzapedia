## Biography
Ben Harper is a three-time GRAMMY Award-winning musician, songwriter, and social activist born on October 28, 1969[1][3]. Raised in a musically rich environment at his family's music store in Los Angeles, Harper was exposed to legendary artists including Brownie McGhee, Sonny Terry, Doc Watson, John Fahey, Leonard Cohen, and Jackson Browne[3]. He performed his first stage appearance at age 12, developing proficiency in slide guitar influenced by blues pioneer Robert Johnson[4]. By age 21, Harper was touring internationally with blues legend Taj Mahal, appearing on Taj's 1990 album "Follow the Drinking Gourd"[4]. After collaborating with Tom Freund on the 1992 album "Pleasure and Pain," Harper signed a worldwide recording contract with Virgin Records in 1993[1].

Harper released his debut album "Welcome to the Cruel World" in 1994, establishing the core members of his longtime backing band The Innocent Criminals: percussionist Leon Mobley, bassist Juan Nelson, and drummer Oliver Charles[1]. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, he released critically acclaimed albums including "Fight for Your Mind" (1995), "The Will to Live" (1997), "Burn to Shine" (1999), "Diamonds on the Inside" (2003), and "Both Sides of the Gun" (2006)[1]. His musical style synthesizes blues, folk, soul, reggae, and rock, establishing him as a singularly powerful songwriter with rare genre versatility[5]. With over 15 million records sold worldwide, Harper has become known not only as a performer but also as a producer and record label founder, leveraging his industry knowledge to support emerging artists[1].

Beyond his solo work, Harper has pursued numerous high-profile collaborations that expanded his artistic reach and earned additional accolades. In 2004, his collaboration with The Blind Boys of Alabama produced the album "There Will Be a Light," which won the GRAMMY Award for Best Traditional Soul Gospel Album[1]. He formed the supergroup Relentless7 in 2007, releasing "White Lies for Dark Times" (2009) and "Give till it's Gone" (2011)[1]. In 2010, Harper collaborated with Dhani Harrison and Joseph Arthur as Fistful of Mercy, and in 2013, he partnered with blues harmonica master Charlie Musselwhite to create "Get Up!" (2013), which won the Best Blues Album GRAMMY Award[1]. His 2020 instrumental album "Winter Is for Lovers" marked his first entirely wordless record, demonstrating his continued artistic evolution[1]. Throughout his career, Harper has maintained a commitment to social activism and has produced records for artists including Mavis Staples, Natalie Maines, and Rickie Lee Jones[5].
