## Biography
Adelaide Louise Hall was born on October 20, 1901, in Brooklyn, New York, to Elizabeth and Arthur William Hall, a music teacher; she attended the Pratt Institute and began her career in 1921 as a chorus member in the groundbreaking Broadway revue Shuffle Along by Noble Sissle and Eubie Blake. A self-taught tap dancer and ukulele player, she progressed to starring roles, including in Runnin' Wild (1923) where she performed 'Old-Fashioned Love,' and gained acclaim for pioneering scat singing—termed 'squagel' by some—with her innovative wordless vocals on Duke Ellington's 'Creole Love Call' (1927), which became a worldwide hit and elevated both their careers. Her style blended vocal jazz, ragtime, and improvisation, marking her as a Harlem Renaissance icon and one of the first jazz singers, admired by Ella Fitzgerald.

Hall's career flourished internationally; she co-starred with Bill 'Bojangles' Robinson in the hit Blackbirds of 1928, introducing 'I Can't Give You Anything But Love,' headlined at the Cotton Club, and toured Europe in The Chocolate Kiddies (1925). In 1934, with husband Wilbur 'Bert' Hicks, she settled in Europe, opening nightclubs in Paris and London (including the Florida Club and Calypso), and starred in shows like The Sun Never Sets (1938). She recorded extensively, including with Fats Waller, made over 70 Decca records, hosted BBC's Wrapped in Velvet (first Black artist with a long-term BBC contract), and in 1941 became Britain's highest-paid female entertainer, surpassing Gracie Fields. Her final Broadway role was in Jamaica (1957-59) with Lena Horne.

Hall's legacy endures as the world's most enduring recording artist, spanning eight decades (per Guinness World Records, 2003), with a 70+ year career until her death on November 7, 1993, in London. She performed with luminaries like Louis Armstrong, owned clubs in New York, London, and Paris, and sang at Ellington's 1974 memorial.
