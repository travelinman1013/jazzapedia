## Biography
The Foundations were a British soul band formed in Bayswater, London, in January 1967, evolving from an earlier group called The Ramong Sound or The Ramongs, which featured lead singers Clem Curtis from Trinidad and Raymond Morrison, later briefly including psychedelic rocker Arthur Brown.[1][2][4] The multi-racial lineup, comprising West Indians, White British members, and a Sri Lankan, managed and performed at their own basement venue, the Butterfly Club, handling music, cooking, and cleaning while living frugally on leftovers and rice to make ends meet.[1][2][4] Discovered by managers Ron Fairway and Barry Class, they gained traction backing acts like The Toys and Edwin Starr, though lead singer Clem Curtis questioned The Toys' authenticity; a brief association with Brian Epstein's NEMS Agency ended with his death.[1][2]

Their career peaked with the 1967 hit 'Baby Now That I've Found You,' written by Tony Macaulay and John MacLeod, reaching number one in the UK and Canada, and top 10 in the US, followed by 1968's 'Build Me Up Buttercup,' co-written by Macaulay and Mike d'Abo, hitting number three on the Billboard Hot 100.[1][2] Known for a soulful, Motown-inspired sound unusual among contemporary British rock acts, they toured extensively but faced setbacks, including saxophonist Pat Burke temporarily leaving due to financial struggles and a disastrous US tour supporting The Temptations in 1970.[1][2][3] The original band disbanded later that year after minor hits like 'Born to Live, Born to Die' and 'My Little Chickadee,' though revivals occurred in the 1980s and 1999, spurred by the renewed popularity of 'Build Me Up Buttercup' in the film There's Something About Mary.[1][2][5]

As the first multi-racial group to top the UK charts in the 1960s, The Foundations left a legacy of soul-infused pop that bridged British and American styles, influencing perceptions of diversity in UK music during a transformative era.[2][4]
