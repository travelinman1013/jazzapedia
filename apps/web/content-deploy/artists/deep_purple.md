## Biography
Deep Purple is an English hard rock band formed in London in 1968 by guitarist Ritchie Blackmore and keyboardist Jon Lord, initially as the brainchild of ex-Searchers drummer Chris Curtis under the name Roundabout, which evolved after lineup changes including vocalist Rod Evans, bassist Nick Simper, and drummer Ian Paice.[1][2][7] The band underwent rapid transformations, with the Mark II lineup of Blackmore, Lord, Paice, vocalist Ian Gillan, and bassist Roger Glover (1969-1973) achieving massive commercial success through albums like 'In Rock,' 'Fireball,' and the landmark live album 'Made in Japan,' pioneering heavy metal with their virtuoso musicianship, heavy riffs, and extended improvisational solos blending hard rock, classical influences, and psychedelia.[1][5][6] Multiple lineup shifts followed, including Mark III with David Coverdale and Glenn Hughes (1973-1975), Mark IV with Tommy Bolin (1975-1976), a breakup until 1984, and reunions with the Mark II core, later featuring Steve Morse on guitar (1994-2022) and current keyboardist Don Airey (2002-present), solidifying their legacy as hard rock innovators over seven decades.[1][2][5]

Deep Purple's musical style evolved from psychedelic and progressive rock roots into a defining force in heavy metal and classic rock, characterized by Lord's orchestral keyboards, Blackmore's aggressive guitar work, Gillan's soaring vocals, and Paice's powerhouse drumming, influencing generations while maintaining a reputation for live intensity and lineup volatility.[1][5][6][8] Despite hiatuses and member departures—such as Blackmore's exits to form Rainbow—the band reformed repeatedly, releasing albums like 'Perfect Strangers' (1984) and 'Bananas' (2003), with Ian Paice as the sole constant member.[1][2] Their enduring appeal spans genres like hard rock and classic rock, as reflected in their Spotify popularity score of 65.[context]

Deep Purple's legacy includes being early heavy metal pioneers, with 'Made in Japan' hailed as one of rock's greatest live albums, and a career marked by over 100 million records sold, induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2016, and ongoing tours with the current lineup of Gillan, Paice, Glover, Airey, and Simon McBride.[1][5]

## Fun Facts
- Deep Purple's first gig was in Denmark in March 1968, shortly after forming from the unstable Roundabout project initiated by Chris Curtis, who soon dropped out.[1][2][4]
- Drummer Ian Paice is the only member present in every lineup since 1968, spanning over 50 years.[1]
- Tommy Bolin, who replaced Blackmore in Mark IV, died of a drug overdose just five months after the band's 1976 split.[1][2]
- The band's name originated from Ritchie Blackmore's fascination with the song 'Deep Purple' by Nino Rota from the film 'Deep Purple,' suggested during early rehearsals.[1]
