## Biography
Barbara Jean Acklin was born on February 28, 1943, in Oakland, California, the only child of Herman and Hazel Acklin. Her family relocated to Chicago, Illinois, around 1948, where she was encouraged to sing from a young age, performing as a soloist at New Zion Baptist Church by age 11 and in nightclubs as a teenager. After graduating from Dunbar Vocational High School, she worked as a secretary at St. Lawrence Records, releasing her debut single 'I'm Not Mad Anymore' under the pseudonym Barbara Allen in 1966, produced by her cousin Monk Higgins.[1][2]

Acklin's career breakthrough came in 1966 when she joined Brunswick Records as a receptionist and submitted demos to producer Carl Davis. Her co-written song 'Whispers (Gettin' Louder)' became a major hit for Jackie Wilson (#5 R&B, #11 Hot 100), securing her a recording contract. She scored her biggest solo success with 'Love Makes a Woman' (1968, #3 R&B, #15 Hot 100), co-written with Eugene Record of the Chi-Lites, Carl Davis, Sonny Sanders, and Gerald Sims. Acklin frequently collaborated with Record, including duets with Gene Chandler like 'Show Me the Way To Go' and co-writing hits such as 'Have You Seen Her' (1971, #1 R&B for Chi-Lites) and 'Two Little Kids' for Peaches & Herb. Her style blended classic soul and northern soul with pop-soul influences akin to Dionne Warwick and Brenda Holloway, yielding multiple R&B charting singles through the 1970s, including 'Raindrops' (#14 R&B, 1974) on Capitol Records.[1][2][4]

After Brunswick, Acklin released her final album *A Place in the Sun* (1975), then worked as a backing vocalist for artists like the Chi-Lites, Tyrone Davis, and Lowrell Simon. She later moved to Omaha, Nebraska, and was recording a new album when she died of pneumonia on November 27, 1998, at age 55. Acklin's legacy endures in Chicago soul, with her songwriting and emotive vocals cementing her as an unsung legend of the genre.[1][2]
