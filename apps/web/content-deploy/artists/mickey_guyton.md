## Biography
Mickey Guyton, born Candace Mycale Guyton on June 17, 1983, in Arlington, Texas, to Michael Eugene Guyton and Phyllis Ann Roddy, grew up as the second of four children in a family that moved frequently due to her father's engineering career. She began singing at age five in the Mount Olive Baptist Church Choir in Arlington, developing a flexible vocal style influenced by Whitney Houston, Dolly Parton, LeAnn Rimes, and gospel artists like BeBe & CeCe Winans. After high school, she moved to Los Angeles in 2001 to attend Santa Monica College, where she pursued music while working day jobs, facing discouragement as a Black woman in country music for eight years.[1][2][3][4]

In 2011, Guyton relocated to Nashville, auditioned with a Patty Loveless song, and signed with Capitol Records Nashville (later Liberty/Capitol). Producer Julian Raymond and managers Gary Borman and Steve Moir, who worked with Keith Urban and Faith Hill, supported her early career. Her 2015 debut single 'Better Than You Left Me' peaked at No. 34 on Billboard's Country Airplay, earning acclaim as a top debut. She performed at the White House in 2014, received ACM nominations, and released EPs like her self-titled 2015 project and Bridges in 2020. 'Black Like Me' from Bridges went viral amid Black Lives Matter protests, earning a 2021 Grammy nomination for Best Country Solo Performance—the first for a Black female solo artist in a country category—and anchoring her debut album Remember Her Name.[1][2][3][4]

Guyton's contemporary country-pop style blends classic country with progressive elements, often addressing racial and gender inequality. She became the first Black woman to host the ACM Awards in 2021 alongside Keith Urban, performed at major events like the Grand Ole Opry and Gracie Awards, and married attorney Grant Savoy in 2017; they have a son, Grayson. Her activism and resilience have positioned her as a trailblazer, dubbed a 'female game-changer' by Billboard and a 'new queen of country' by Entertainment Weekly.[1][2][3]
