## Biography
The Subdudes, an American roots rock band from New Orleans, Louisiana, formed spontaneously in April 1987 at Tipitina's nightclub when Tommy Malone (vocals, guitar), Johnny Ray Allen (bass), Steve Amedée (vocals, percussion), and John Magnie (vocals, keyboards, accordion) jammed together. Three members—Malone, Allen, and Amedée—grew up together in the small sugarcane town of Edgard, Louisiana, forming their first band in high school inspired by Malone's older brother Dave Malone of The Radiators, while Magnie, a Denver native, brought New Orleans piano influences after moving there in 1974. Their acoustic sound, featuring Amedée on tambourine instead of drums, blended Americana, roots rock, Cajun, zydeco, swamp pop, New Orleans R&B, and gospel with rich harmonic vocals, leading to Monday night residencies at Tipitina's and a move to Colorado in 1987 for ski resorts and clubs.[1][2][4][5]

The band quickly gained traction, winning Musician magazine’s Best Unsigned Band contest with 'On His Mind' and signing with Atlantic Records, releasing their eponymous debut album in 1989, followed by more albums on High Street Records. They toured extensively for a decade before disbanding amicably in 1996 due to burnout, spawning spin-off projects like Tiny Town and solo efforts. Reuniting in 2002/2003 without Allen (who passed in 2014), they added Tim Cook and Jimmy Messa, releasing albums like Miracle Mule (2004, produced by Freddy Koella), Behind The Levee (2006, produced by Keb’ Mo’), and others, maintaining a cult following with their timeless, street-meets-choir style into the present day.[1][2][3][5]

Their legacy endures as New Orleans favorites, bridging pre-Americana roots music with harmonic innovation, influencing the genre's rise while preserving Louisiana's musical traditions through consistent touring and recordings despite lineup changes and hiatuses.

## Fun Facts
- The band formed from a single impromptu gig at Tipitina's in 1987 using a tambourine stolen from Steve Amedée's landlady instead of a drum kit, defining their signature acoustic sound.
- John Magnie, from Denver, lived in a hippie commune near Steamboat Springs raising pigs and goats before moving to New Orleans in 1974 to study its piano style.
- They signed their Atlantic Records deal in an official ceremony in Colorado Governor Roy Romer's office in 1988.
- The band's name originated from a casual gig reference at Tipitina's, and they briefly reunited as 'The Dudes' in 2002 before reverting to 'subdudes'.
