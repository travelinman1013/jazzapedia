## Biography
Floatstone is the musical alter ego of Brick de Bois, born in 1961 in Antwerp, Belgium, emerging from a theater family that guided him toward the stage. Details on his early life remain limited in available sources, but he has developed a career as an independent musician, releasing original works and performing under this moniker. His musical style blends introspective songwriting with evocative themes, as heard in tracks like 'River Song,' inspired by personal experiences such as a bountiful summer harvest of food and love in 2018.

De Bois, as Floatstone, has been actively recording new material, including an upcoming album titled 'Speed of Tree,' tracked at a leisurely pace in France. While specific details on genre, major releases, or widespread recognition are scarce—reflected in zero popularity on platforms like Spotify—his output suggests a niche, personal approach to music production. No extensive discography or major career milestones are documented in credible sources, indicating Floatstone operates outside mainstream visibility.

Floatstone's legacy appears rooted in grassroots creativity, with ongoing projects pointing to sustained artistic output into the present day. Without broader critical acclaim or commercial success noted, his influence remains localized to independent music circles in Belgium and Europe.
