## Biography
Jimmy Bosch, a Puerto Rican-American trombonist, composer, bandleader, and singer, was born in Jersey City or Hoboken, New Jersey, to parents from Arecibo, Puerto Rico, and raised in Hoboken, NJ, later living in the Bronx for twenty years. He began playing trombone in 1970 at age 8, self-taught moñas (musical riffs) by age 13, and started performing in local bands like La Caliente, Arco Iris, and La Sonica while frequenting New York City clubs. While studying classical music at Rutgers University in 1978, he was hired by Andy Gonzalez for Conjunto Libre, launching a prolific career that included collaborations with salsa legends.[1][2][4][6]

Bosch's career exploded through landmark recordings with Ray Barretto, Machito Orchestra, Libre, Caiman All-Stars, and Cachao's Master Sessions, showcasing his explosive trombone style in salsa clásica and hard-hitting horn sections. In 1996, he founded La Orquesta Jimmy Bosch, debuting with the 1998 album Soneando Trombón on RykoLatino after festival triumphs at Lincoln Center, North Sea Jazz, Montreal Jazz, Umbria Jazz, and Sydney Festival. His follow-up Salsa Dura revitalized the genre, blending Puerto Rican plenas, Afro-Cuban mambo, New York salsa, jazz, rock, and eclectic influences into his signature **Salsa Dura**—energetic, improvisational tropical music with a New York edge.[1][2][3][5][6]

Over 45 years, Bosch has recorded on over 100 productions, toured 40+ countries with FANIA All-Stars, Celia Cruz, Eddie Palmieri, Ruben Blades, and others, and appeared on TV with Jay Leno, Rosie O'Donnell, and Buena Vista Social Club. A fiebrú (feverish salsa enthusiast), he continues leading La Orquesta Jimmy Bosch and Jimmy Bosch y su Sexteto de Otro Mundo, reinventing Latin traditions while inspiring global salseros with his versatile, passionate performances.[2][5][6]
