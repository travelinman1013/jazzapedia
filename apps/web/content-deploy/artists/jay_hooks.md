## Biography
Jay Hooks, born and raised in Houston, Texas, began his musical journey in the late 1970s and 1980s, playing guitar on the Houston bar circuit and cutting his teeth on Gulf Coast blues under the influence of local legends like Albert Collins and Billy Gibbons. He incorporated the electric blues-rock sound reminiscent of Stevie Ray Vaughan while maintaining traditional blues roots, touring extensively with Antone’s recording artist Lavelle White in the 1990s to earn his reputation. By the late 1990s, he fronted his own band, releasing his debut album *Hooked Up* in 1998 on Sunburst Records, produced by Dan Workman, followed by signing with Provogue Records for his self-titled *Jay Hooks* in 2000 (produced by Ben Elliot) and *Red Line* in 2002 (produced by Hadden Sayers), which fueled international tours including a standout 2003 Rockpalast appearance in Germany.

Hooks's style is characterized as Texas blues-rock with an outlaw edge—raw, loud, gritty, and soulful, blending Gulf Coast roadhouse energy, Texas grit, rock-and-roll swagger, and themes of life, love, and trouble drawn from personal experiences on the road. After achieving international acclaim in the early 2000s, he stepped away from music to focus on family and business, returning in 2018 prompted by Gulf Coast Records artist Mark May. This reignited his career, leading to his 2025 album *Tequila & Bullets* on Joplin Street Music, produced by Matthew R. Johnson, co-written with Dennis Chenault, and featuring bandmates like Jorge Castillo, Barry Seelen, Myron “Big Jack” Jackson, Brock Proctor, and Johnson on drums, recorded at Sound Arts in Houston.

Hooks's legacy endures as a fiery Texas blues export, bridging traditional roots with global appeal through unrelenting live energy and authentic storytelling. His comeback with *Tequila & Bullets* captures the raw honesty he misses from past music, positioning him as a vital force keeping blues-rock alive amid fears of dilution.
