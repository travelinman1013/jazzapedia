## Biography
Dalton Sinclair Bishop, better known as Jackie Opel, was born on 27 August 1937 in Bridgetown, Barbados, and emerged as a local superstar by his late teens, performing at venues like the Coconut Creek Club in St. James at age 17. Idolizing Jackie Wilson, he developed a rich, powerful voice with a high octave range—rumored to span six octaves—and electrifying dance moves akin to James Brown, earning him the nickname 'the Jackie Wilson of the Caribbean.' In the early 1960s, he was discovered by Byron Lee of the Dragonaires and brought to Jamaica, where he immersed himself in the burgeoning ska scene, working with producers like Clement 'Coxsone' Dodd at Studio One and contributing to the genre's evolution through ska, R&B, soul, gospel, calypso, and his innovative fusion style.[1][2][3][5]

Opel's career peaked in Jamaica as an occasional vocalist with the Skatalites, the pioneering ska band, where he composed songs, arranged music alongside Roland Alphonso, and recorded hits like 'Old Rockin' Chair,' 'Sit Down Servant' (a version of the early ska vocal 'Push Wood'), and duets with Doreen Shaffer and Hortense Ellis. Backed by future reggae icons Bob Marley and Peter Tosh on tracks such as 'Mill Man,' 'Hairy Mango,' and 'A Time to Cry' in 1964, he also released singles on labels like Ska Beat, Island, and Rio, blending American soul-gospel inflections with Caribbean rhythms. Credited with inventing spouge—a Barbados-born hybrid of ska, calypso, and R&B—he later moved to Trinidad before returning home, voted Jamaica's 'Entertainer of the Year' multiple times and composing over 700 songs despite his short life.[1][2][3][4]

Tragically, at age 32, Opel died on 9 March 1970 in a car crash on Lower Bay Street in Bridgetown, shortly after performing at Islands Inn hotel where U.S. executives had expressed interest in his recordings. He was ejected from the vehicle into a wire fence following a collision, leaving behind a profound legacy as a musical innovator who bridged Barbadian and Jamaican sounds but remains underrecognized in ska and reggae histories.[1][2]
