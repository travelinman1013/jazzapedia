## Biography
Slum Village is a hip hop group formed in the mid-1990s in Detroit, Michigan's Conant Gardens neighborhood by childhood friends and Pershing High School classmates Baatin (Titus Glover, 1974–2009), T3 (Rajos Allen), and rapper-producer J Dilla (James Yancey, 1974–2006). Emerging from Detroit's underground scene, they initially went by Ssenepod and recorded their debut album *Fantastic, Vol. 1* in 1996–1997, which gained cult status through bootlegs despite not being officially released until 2006. Their sound blended jazz rap influences from golden-age New York groups like A Tribe Called Quest and De La Soul with slick Detroit production, marked by J Dilla's innovative beats.[1][2][3][5]

Signing with Barak/A&M in 1998, they faced label issues, releasing *Best Kept Secret* (2000) under the alias J-88 using *Fantastic* leftovers. *Fantastic, Vol. 2* (2000) featured guests like D'Angelo, Busta Rhymes, and Q-Tip, boosting their profile. J Dilla left in 2001 for a solo career; Elzhi joined for *Trinity (Past, Present and Future)* (2002), a moderate success with the hit 'Tainted.' Baatin departed due to health issues around 2002–2003, leading to *Detroit Deli* (2005) with T3 and Elzhi, including Kanye West-produced 'Selfish' featuring John Legend. After J Dilla's 2006 death and Baatin's 2009 passing, T3 became the sole original survivor, with lineups including Young RJ (from 2002) and briefly Illa J.[1][3][4][5]

Known for lineup fluidity, Slum Village's legacy endures through T3 and Young RJ as a duo, continuing to release music like *F.U.N.* (2024). Their jazz-infused, soulful hip hop influenced Detroit's scene and beyond, cementing them as pioneers despite tragedies and label woes.[1][5]
