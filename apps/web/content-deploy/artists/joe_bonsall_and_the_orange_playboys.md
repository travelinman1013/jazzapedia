## Biography
Joe Bonsall was born in June 1921 near Lake Arthur, Louisiana, where he grew up immersed in Cajun music traditions. Starting at age nine, he played the triangle alongside his mother's accordion before mastering the accordion, guitar, and violin himself. By age 14, he performed with Cajun pioneers Lawrence Walker and Joe Falcon. His family relocated to Orange County, Texas, during his teen years, prompting him to form the Orange Playboys for local dances.[1][5][7]

Adulthood brought service as a decorated Marine during World War II, after which Bonsall resumed music, reactivating the Orange Playboys in 1951. The band gained prominence in Southeast Texas Cajun dancehalls, rivaling acts like Aldus Roger and the Lafayette Playboys, with radio, club performances, and record sales. In 1963, producer John 'Tee Bruce' Broussard partnered with Floyd Soileau of Swallow Records to release their music, boosting popularity through hits like 'Your Picture' and 'Grand Prairie Waltz.' The group recorded extensively from 1964-1975, blending standards with originals, showcasing Bonsall's precise accordion style.[1][5]

Bonsall's legacy includes induction into the Cajun Music Hall of Fame in 1981 alongside legends like Iry Lejeune and Nathan Abshire. He contributed to the Lake Shore Club Cajun Music Hall of Fame and co-founded the Lake Charles Chapter of the Cajun French Music Association in 1990 with Phil Menard. Active for over 50 years until his death at age 75, he remains a Cajun music icon, with Swallow's Cajun Pioneer Series preserving his output.[1][6]
