## Biography
Bob James, born Robert McElhiney James on December 25, 1939, in Marshall, Missouri, began his musical journey early, securing his first professional gig at age 8 and winning contest ribbons by age 11. He wrote his first band arrangement in his early teens and played in local bands like the Earl Parsons dance band (1952-1955). Attending the University of Michigan, he explored free jazz and, in 1962, his avant-garde trio won the Notre Dame Collegiate Jazz Festival, judged by Quincy Jones and Henry Mancini, leading to his debut album *Bold Conceptions* (1963) on Mercury Records[1][2][3][4][5][6][7].

Relocating to New York, James served as arranger and pianist for Sarah Vaughan for four and a half years, recording with Chet Baker and Hubert Laws, and reunited with Quincy Jones for arranging work. Hired by Creed Taylor at CTI Records, he produced and arranged albums for Grover Washington Jr. (*Mister Magic*), Milt Jackson, Stanley Turrentine, Maynard Ferguson, and others, pioneering jazz fusion with the Fender Rhodes. His solo CTI albums like *One* (1974) launched his signature smooth jazz sound, followed by founding Tappan Zee Records, hits like *Touchdown* featuring 'Angela' (theme from *Taxi*), and classical ventures such as *Rameau* (1984)[1][2][3][4][5].

James co-founded the smooth jazz supergroup Fourplay, releasing ten albums including *X* (2006), earned Grammy Awards for *One on One* with Earl Klugh (1980) and *Double Vision* with David Sanborn (1985)—both million-sellers—and composed all original music for *Taxi*. With over 58 albums, multiple gold/platinum records, and ongoing tours into his 80s, James defined contemporary and smooth jazz while exploring trios (*Espresso*) and global performances[1][2][3][4].
