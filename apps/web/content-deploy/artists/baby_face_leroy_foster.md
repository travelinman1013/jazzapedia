## Biography
Leroy 'Baby Face' Foster was born on February 1, 1923, in Algoma, Mississippi, southwest of Tupelo. He relocated to Chicago in the mid-1940s, around 1945, arriving with harmonica player Little Walter and pianist Johnny Jones, his first cousin. There, he honed his skills playing for tips on Maxwell Street before joining clubs, working with pianist Sunnyland Slim, harmonica player John Lee 'Sonny Boy' Williamson, and pianist Lee Brown. By 1946, an acquaintance introduced him to Muddy Waters at a recording session, leading Foster to join Waters' band as a guitarist and drummer alongside Jimmy Rogers, later with Little Walter on harmonica. Known as the Headhunters, this group gained notoriety for musically dominating other bands in Chicago clubs.[1][2][3]

Foster's recording career began in 1945 with guitar on Lee Brown's 'My Little Girl Blues' b/w 'Bobbie Town Boogie' for the Chicago label. He recorded sessions with Brown (1946, Queen label), James 'Beale Street' Clark (1946, Columbia), Sunnyland Slim (1947-1948, Opera), and others, while playing on Aristocrat tracks like Muddy Waters' 'You're Gonna Miss Me' and Floyd Jones' 'Hard Times' (1948, Tempo-Tone). As a leader, he cut 'Locked Out Boogie' b/w 'Shady Grove Blues' (1948, Aristocrat 1234, billed with Muddy Waters), 'My Head Can't Rest Anymore' b/w 'Take a Little Walk with Me' (1949, J.O.B. 100), and 'Boll Weevil' b/w 'Red Headed Woman' (1950, Parkway 104). His 1950 Parkway session with Waters, Little Walter, and Rogers produced the acclaimed 'Rollin' and Tumblin' (Part 1 & 2), praised in the Chicago Defender for its raw, African chant-like energy, though it caused contract issues for Waters with Chess Records. Further J.O.B. singles followed in 1951-1952. Foster's style featured a warm, high-pitched voice blending Sonny Boy Williamson and Doctor Clayton influences, with shouts, encouragements, unfussy Chicago-style drums, and sparse guitar.[1][2][3]

Foster died young on May 26, 1958, in Chicago at age 35 (or 38 per some accounts), likely from health issues tied to heavy drinking, cutting short a promising career. As a charter Headhunter and early Muddy Waters band member, he helped shape postwar electric Chicago blues but faded into obscurity due to his early death and limited solo success after Parkway folded.[1][2][3]
