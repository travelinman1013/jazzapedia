## Biography
Jazmine Marie Sullivan was born on April 9, 1987, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to parents Don and Pam Sullivan. Her mother, a former backup singer for Philadelphia International Records, introduced her to music early on, as Jazmine sang in the children's choir at church before joining the adult choir. At age five, her family moved into the Historic Strawberry Mansion, where her father worked as curator. She attended Philadelphia High School for the Creative and Performing Arts, graduating in 2005 as a vocal music major, and began her professional journey by performing gospel at events like a McDonald's contest and singing with Stevie Wonder at age 13. Initially limited to gospel, she rejected a deal with a gospel label at 11 and signed with Jive Records at 15, though no album was released, leading her to focus on songwriting.[1][2][3][4]

Sullivan signed with J Records in 2007, releasing her debut album *Fearless* in 2008, which debuted at number 6 on the Billboard 200 and topped the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, certified platinum with hits like 'Need U Bad' and 'Bust Your Windows.' Her follow-up, *Love Me Back* (2010), received critical acclaim. After a hiatus, she joined RCA Records, releasing *Reality Show* (2015), another R&B chart-topper, and the EP *Heaux Tales* (2021), featuring 'Pick Up Your Feelings.' Known for her powerful contralto vocals, emotive storytelling, and blend of classic R&B with modern production, she has earned two Grammy Awards, BET Awards, and a Billboard Women in Music Award, named one of Time's 100 Most Influential People in 2022.[2][3][5]

Sullivan's legacy lies in her authentic songwriting, often drawing from personal experiences, and her influence on contemporary R&B/soul. Her genre is R&B, with a Spotify popularity of 63, and she remains active since 2003, celebrated for commercial success and critical praise.[1][3][6]
