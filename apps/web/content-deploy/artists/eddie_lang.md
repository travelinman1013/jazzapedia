## Biography
Eddie Lang (born Salvatore Massaro; October 25, 1902 – March 26, 1933) was an American musician credited as the father of jazz guitar.[6] Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Lang came from a musical family—his father made fretted stringed instruments and taught him to play guitar after he completed 11 years of violin lessons.[1][4] In the early 1920s, Lang played with former schoolmate Joe Venuti in Atlantic City and toured with the Mound City Blue Blowers before settling in New York City in 1924, where he quickly became a studio favorite.[1] His technical brilliance and innovative single-string solos revolutionized jazz guitar playing during an era when the instrument was still establishing its role in the genre.

Lang's career flourished in the late 1920s as he became the most important early jazz stylist to play single-string solos on guitar.[1] He made noted recordings with Frank Trumbauer and Bix Beiderbecke, including the landmark "Singin' the Blues" (1927).[1] Under the pseudonym Blind Willie Dunn, he accompanied blues singers and recorded guitar duets with Lonnie Johnson and King Oliver.[1] His partnership with violinist Joe Venuti produced numerous celebrated recordings including "Stringing the Blues" (1926), and the two became musical soulmates despite contrasting personalities.[2] Lang's association with the Paul Whiteman Orchestra (1929–30) led to his work as guitar accompanist to Bing Crosby in the singer's early solo career, and he appeared on film in Whiteman's "The King of Jazz."[1][2]

Lang's influence on jazz guitar was profound and immediate, inspiring future guitarists like Carl Kress and Dick McDonough, though Lang remained the pacesetter of his era.[2] His musical artistry was admired by both white and African-American performers, including Lonnie Johnson, who considered their collaborations among the high points of his career.[2] Lang's untimely death on March 26, 1933, at age 30, resulted from complications following a tonsillectomy,[1] cutting short a career that had already established him as a foundational figure in jazz history.
