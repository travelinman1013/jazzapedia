## Biography
Jerod “Rody” Lewis, known as Big Chief Roddy or Big Chief Rody, was a prominent Mardi Gras Indian chief from New Orleans, leading the Black Eagles tribe, one of the oldest uptown Mardi Gras Indian tribes alongside the White Eagles and Golden Eagles. Born around 1964, his Indian heritage was rooted in the Calliope housing project (later B.W. Cooper), and he succeeded his father, Percy “Big Chief Pete” Lewis, as leader of the Black Eagles in 1981 following his father's passing. Roddy possessed one of the most distinctive and powerful voices in the Mardi Gras Indian community, often compared to the legendary Big Chief Bo Dollis of the Wild Magnolias for his strong, charismatic baritone, which he used to chant ancient songs at practices, second line parades, and performances at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival[1].

Roddy's career highlighted his role in bridging traditional rivalries within the Mardi Gras Indian culture. He was one of the few chiefs to have his vocals featured on commercial releases, singing lead on six of the ten tracks on the landmark 1998 album *United We Stand, Divided We Fall* by the Indians of the Nation, including a tribute to his father, “Pete Came Early That Mornin’.” This recording was groundbreaking as it united chiefs from uptown and downtown tribes, overcoming longstanding rivalries. Later, he served as an original lead vocalist in the Mardi Gras Indian Orchestra alongside figures like Big Chief David Montana and Bruce “Sunpie” Barnes[1][3].

Big Chief Roddy's legacy endures through his contributions to preserving and performing Mardi Gras Indian traditions, particularly in the post-Hurricane Katrina era, where photos from a St. Joseph’s Day parade captured his despair over the razing of his childhood community. He passed away on November 25, 2013, at the age of 49[1].
