## Biography
Ricky Ford, born March 4, 1954, in Boston, Massachusetts, began his musical journey in the Boston area playing drums and melodica before switching to tenor saxophone at age 15, inspired by Rahsaan Roland Kirk and his father's collection of Savoy records featuring Charlie Parker, Lester Young, and Coleman Hawkins. He enrolled at the New England Conservatory of Music around 1968-1970, studying with renowned teachers including Joe Allard, Gunther Schuller, Ran Blake, Jaki Byard, George Russell, and Joseph Maneri, earning a Bachelor of Music in 1983. Pianist Ran Blake encouraged his studies, and at age 20, Ford joined the Duke Ellington Orchestra under Mercer Ellington in 1974, replacing Paul Gonsalves, after recording with Schuller on an Ellington tribute.[2][1][3][4]

Ford's career advanced rapidly; he performed with Sonny Rollins in 1973 at The Jazz Workshop in Boston, joined Charles Mingus from 1976-1977 (introduced by Jaki Byard), Dannie Richmond (1978-1981), Lionel Hampton (1980-1982), Mingus Dynasty (1982), and Abdullah Ibrahim (1985). He recorded prolifically as a leader for Muse and Candid labels in the 1980s and 1990s, freelancing in New York with a fierce hard bop style influenced by tenor giants like Paul Gonsalves and Sonny Rollins. Settling in Paris in the 1990s, he led big bands, collaborated with Ze Big Band on albums like 7095 (2009) and Sacred Concert (2013), and founded the Toucy Jazz Festival in 2009.[1][2][3][5]

A multifaceted artist, Ford taught at Istanbul Bilgi University (2001-2006), influencing Turkish saxophonists, led Brandeis University's big band (1985-1996) arranging rare works, and pursued painting and composition. His legacy endures through 21 leader albums, sideman work with jazz legends, and ongoing performances, maintaining a strong presence in the expatriate jazz scene in France.[3][4][5]
