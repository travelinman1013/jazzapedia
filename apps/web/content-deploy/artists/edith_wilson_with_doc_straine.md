## Biography
Edith Wilson (September 2, 1896 – March 30, 1981) was an American blues singer and vaudeville performer born into a background of church-going and suburban gentility. Discovered at age 13 by show producer Joe Clark, who secretly put her onstage at White City Park, her talent impressed audiences despite her parents' initial disapproval. She began recording in 1921 with hits like 'Nervous Blues' and 'Vampin' Liza Jane,' backed initially by her husband Danny Wilson on piano, and later with Johnny Dunn's Original Jazz Hounds on tracks such as 'Frankie' and 'Old Time Blues.' Unlike many blues singers of the era, Wilson avoided raunchy skits and explicit lyrics, opting for sweeter, crossover-appealing songs that resonated with both Black and white audiences, establishing her as a distinctive vaudeville and recording artist.[1][7]

Wilson's career flourished in the 1920s with tours via the Theater Owners Booking Association (TOBA), performances at the Cotton Club alongside comic Doc Straine, and starring roles in revues like Lew Leslie's *Blackbirds*, which toured Europe and earned her acclaim in Paris as the 'colored chanteuse with naughty lyrics and impertinent humor.' She collaborated with luminaries like Fats Waller, who composed '(What Did I Do To Be So) Black and Blue' for her 1928 Brunswick recording, and continued with Victor sessions including 'My Handy Man Ain't Handy No More.' The Great Depression halted her recording career, but she toured Europe frequently in the 1930s and revived her profile in the U.S. with Charlie Barnet's big band and Eubie Blake's *Shuffle Along* productions, extending her reach to the West Coast and Canada.[1]

In her later years, Wilson performed into the 1970s in Chicago clubs, dressed in purple chiffon and turban, while advocating for a home for indigent performers—a project that never materialized due to her health decline from a weak heart. Known for her sparkling eyes, mischievous smile, and international blues reputation, she left a legacy as a resilient crossover artist who navigated vaudeville, revues, and big bands over decades.[1]
