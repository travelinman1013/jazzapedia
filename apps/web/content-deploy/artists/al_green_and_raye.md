## Biography
Albert Leornes Greene, known professionally as Al Green, was born on April 13, 1946, in Forrest City, Arkansas, US. At age nine, he began singing in a gospel quartet with his brothers, touring regionally before his family moved to Michigan. At 16, he transitioned to R&B, forming the Creations (later Al Green & the Soul Mates), which released the moderately successful single 'Back Up Train' in 1968. His career breakthrough came in 1969 upon meeting producer Willie Mitchell in Memphis, Tennessee, leading to a transformative partnership that refined Green's smooth yet gritty soul style blending sensual falsetto, husky groans, and gospel intensity with sophisticated melodies and distinctive bass lines.[1][2][3]

Green's peak commercial success arrived in the early 1970s with Hi Records, producing soul classics like 'Tired of Being Alone' (1971), 'Let's Stay Together' (1972)—his signature number-one hit—'I'm Still in Love with You' (1972), 'Love and Happiness' (1973), and 'Take Me to the River' (1974). These tracks, often co-written with Mitchell, showcased his ability to fuse sacred gospel roots with secular romance, drawing from influences like Sam Cooke. In 1976, a personal incident prompted Green to become an ordained minister, founding Full Gospel Tabernacle in Memphis; by 1980, he fully committed to gospel music, releasing albums like 'The Lord Will Make a Way' (1980) and earning multiple Grammy Awards in soul gospel categories.[1][2]

Green cautiously returned to secular music in the late 1980s, reuniting with Mitchell for albums like 'He Is the Light' (1985) and later projects including 'I Can't Stop' (2003), 'Everything's OK' (2005), and 'Lay It Down' (2008), which featured neo-soul collaborators and topped charts for the first time since the 1970s. His legacy as a canonical Memphis soul artist endures, with honors including Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction (1995), Grammy Lifetime Achievement (2002), Kennedy Center Honors (2014), and rankings on Rolling Stone's greatest artists and singers lists. No verified collaboration with artist RAYE was found in credible sources.[1][2]
