## Biography
Orlando Gilbert is a New Orleans-based jazz saxophonist and composer born into a deeply musical family, where he was immersed in music from an early age and formally studied the saxophone.[5] As the son of legendary brass band saxophonist John 'Prince' Gilbert, who shaped the role of the saxophone in contemporary New Orleans brass band music through his work with bands like Rebirth Brass Band, Treme Brass Band, New Birth Brass Band, Hot 8 Brass Band, and Little Rascals Brass Band, Orlando grew up steeped in the city's rich brass band heritage.[1] This familial legacy profoundly influenced his career development, leading him to honor his father's contributions by collaborating on music and organizing community tributes.

Orlando has emerged as a distinctive voice in New Orleans jazz, blending traditional jazz elements with modern influences in his compositions and performances.[4] A key milestone in his career is the 2023 father-son album 'A Crescent City Connection' with John Gilbert, which aimed to give his father the recognition he deserved, alongside releases like the single 'New Orleans Party.'[1][2] He has performed with esteemed groups such as the Treme Brass Band, featured on their track 'New Orleans,' and maintains an active presence through his website, showcasing projects, bookings, and new music.[2][4]

While still building his legacy, Orlando continues his father's tradition by celebrating New Orleans' brass band culture, including organizing second lines and fundraisers following his father's death in December 2024, ensuring the music's vibrant spirit endures.[1]
