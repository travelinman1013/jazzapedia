## Biography
Tommy Olivencia (Ángel Tomás Olivencia Pagán, 1938–2006) was a celebrated Puerto Rican salsa bandleader and trumpeter who founded one of the most influential orchestras in salsa history.[3] Born in San Juan on May 15, 1938, Olivencia formally established his orchestra in 1960, initially known as Tommy Olivencia y La Primerísima Orquesta de Puerto Rico.[4] His ensemble became renowned as "La Escuelita" (The Little School) because it served as a training ground and launching pad for numerous salsa vocalists who would become major stars in the genre.[3]

Paquito Guzmán emerged as one of Tommy Olivencia's most prominent vocalists, joining the orchestra after leaving Los Primos to replace Luis Lebrón.[1] Guzmán's recruitment coincided with the orchestra's daily radio program on WKAQ, marking a pivotal moment when Olivencia's band began establishing its own musical identity beyond interpretations of Sonora Matancera and Rafael Cortijo hits.[1] Sharing vocal duties with Chamaco Ramírez—who became known as the "guarachero" while Guzmán took the bolero style—the two created one of salsa's most balanced and original vocal partnerships.[2] Together, they recorded landmark albums including *Cueros, salsa y sentimiento* (1972), *Secuestro* (1973), and *Juntos de nuevo* (1974).[1]

Guzmán remained with Olivencia's orchestra until 1985, after which he launched a successful solo career that would pioneer the romantic salsa movement.[1] His 1986 album *Champán y ron: las mejores baladas de salsa* is considered a foundational work in romantic salsa, followed by *Tu Amante Romántico* (1988), *Aquí conmigo* (1989), and *El mismo romántico* (1990), which featured hits like "Ser amantes," "Cinco noches," and "25 rosas."[1][2] Olivencia's orchestra remained a vital force in Puerto Rican salsa for over three and a half decades until his death on September 22, 2006, leaving an indelible legacy through the numerous artists it cultivated.[3]
