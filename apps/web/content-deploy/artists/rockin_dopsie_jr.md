## Biography
Rockin' Dopsie, Jr. (born David Rubin), son of zydeco legend Alton Jay 'Rockin' Dopsie' Rubin Sr. (1932-1993), grew up immersed in the music from an early age in Lafayette, Louisiana. His earliest musical memories were of his father's accordion playing; at nine, he received a basic accordion from his father and taught himself by playing along with the radio, much like his father had done. In his early teens, he played in several bands and initially drummed in school, but at age 18, he stepped in on the rubboard (washboard) after the band's player passed away, marking his breakthrough. At 21, he received his first rubboard and joined his father's band officially in 1982, contributing to their international notoriety through high-energy performances blending zydeco with R&B influences.[1][2][4][6]

Following his father's death in 1993, David Rubin inherited the stage name Rockin' Dopsie, Jr. and took over leadership of the Zydeco Twisters, now known as Rockin' Dopsie Jr. & The Zydeco Twisters. Renowned as the world's best rubboard player, a masterful vocalist, and an electrifying showman with dynamic stage moves including splits in James Brown style, he infused the band with jazz, funk, and brass elements while preserving authentic zydeco roots. The band, featuring brothers Tiger Dopsie (Alton Jr.) on drums and Anthony Dopsie on accordion, has performed globally, appearing on TV shows like Gayle King Show (1998), Live with Regis and Kathie Lee (1999), Wheel of Fortune (2000), and with stars including Paul Simon, Tina Turner, Bob Dylan, Beyoncé, John Fogerty, Harry Connick Jr., B.B. King, Bonnie Raitt, and Dan Aykroyd.[1][2][4]

Dopsie Jr.'s legacy continues the family dynasty, honored notably in 1994 at the Smithsonian where the band performed for the exhibit of his father's 'King of Zydeco' crown. His high-energy, audience-participation shows emphasize danceable zydeco grooves, establishing him as a leading practitioner who carries forward Creole culture worldwide.[2][3][4]
