## Biography
Delfeayo Marsalis, born in 1965 in New Orleans, Louisiana, grew up in a renowned musical family as the fourth of six sons to jazz pianist Ellis Marsalis Jr. and Dolores Marsalis. He began playing trombone with early influences including J.J. Johnson, Curtis Fuller, Al Grey, Tyree Glenn, Tommy Dorsey, and Duke Ellington's trombone section. Marsalis attended the New Orleans Center for Creative Arts high school, received classical training at the Eastern Music Festival and Tanglewood Institute, majored in performance and audio production at Berklee College of Music, earned a master's in jazz performance from the University of Louisville, and was later conferred a doctorate by New England College. From age 17, he immersed himself in production, interning at Sea Saint Studio and producing demos for his brothers and peers, launching a career that has yielded over 125 recordings, one Grammy award, and several nominations.[1][4][5][6]

Marsalis developed as a trombonist, composer, and bandleader, touring internationally with legends like Ray Charles, Art Blakey, Max Roach, Elvin Jones, Slide Hampton, Fats Domino, and Abdullah Ibrahim. His style blends post-bop trombone with New Orleans traditions, praised for technical excellence, inventiveness, and humor. In 2000, he founded the Uptown Music Theatre, a non-profit empowering youth through musical theater, writing 16 musicals and over 100 jazz-introducing songs, reaching 10,000+ students via Swinging with the Cool School workshops. In 2007 or 2008, he formed the Uptown Jazz Orchestra (UJO) to preserve jazz traditions like riff-playing, group improvisation, and New Orleans polyphony, infusing young local talent beyond brass bands. As a leader, he has released ten critically acclaimed CDs, including Crescent City Jewels, Pontius Pilate's Decision, and Sweet Thunder, with the Marsalis family earning NEA Jazz Masters status in 2011.[1][2][3][6][8]

Beyond performance, Marsalis founded non-profits like Keep New Orleans Music Alive and directed programs such as the Foundation for Artistic and Musical Excellence. His production work spans artists like Harry Connick Jr., Terence Blanchard, Preservation Hall Jazz Band, The Stooges Brass Band, and family projects, coining acoustic jazz recording techniques with engineer Patrick Smith. The Uptown Jazz Orchestra continues as a dynamic big band celebrating Mardi Gras vibes and classic-to-modern jazz.[2][7]

- He formed the Uptown Jazz Orchestra partly to address New Orleans' lack of young jazz talent beyond brass bands, focusing on traditions like spontaneous group improvisations.[2]
