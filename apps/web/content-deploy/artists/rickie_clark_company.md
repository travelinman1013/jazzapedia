## Biography
The Rickie Clark Company was an early 1980s boogie funk band founded in Indianapolis by Paul Thomas (also known as Pryme Tyme, 'P', or the 'Funky Skunk'), alongside Stanlee Paul. Emerging from the local music scene, Thomas began his career performing with various R&B, pop, rock, jazz, and gospel acts before transitioning to multi-track recording in 1979 and touring with the disco group LTD in 1981. Upon returning to Indianapolis in 1983, the group signed to Circle City Records, a disco and funk label that became a division of Tyscot, Inc., allowing them to release secular music parallel to the label's gospel focus[2][4].

The band's sound blended boogie funk with electro elements, characteristic of the era's dance music innovations. They are featured on Soul Jazz Records compilations such as 'ELECTRO THROWDOWN – Sci-Fi Inter-Planetary Electro Attack on Planet Earth 1982-89' and released material like 'Time to Throw Down,' led by Thomas as producer, musician, singer, and songwriter[4][5][7]. Related act Circle City Band, also founded by Thomas and Stanlee Paul, achieved notable success with their 1983-1985 singles, particularly 'Magic,' which gained radio airplay, became a DJ staple, and served as the theme for BET[2]. Specific solo releases or extensive discography for Rickie Clark Company remain limited in available records, aligning with their underground status and Spotify popularity of 0 in soul jazz genres[context].

The group's legacy endures through reissues, such as Circle City Band's full album in 2012 by Ubiquity Records, highlighting their influence on boogie funk and electro scenes. As part of the broader Indianapolis funk movement under Circle City Records, they contributed to the fusion of funk, disco, and emerging electronic sounds during a pivotal transition in dance music[2][5].
