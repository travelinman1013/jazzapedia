## Biography
Carl Allen, born April 25, 1961, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, grew up immersed in gospel, R&B, and funk music before discovering jazz as a teenager through a recording by saxophonist Benny Carter, which inspired his lifelong dedication to the genre.[1][2][3] He began his professional career in Milwaukee with early gigs alongside jazz luminaries Sonny Stitt and James Moody, then attended the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay and William Paterson University, graduating with a BM in Jazz Studies and Performance.[2][3] A pivotal moment came when he joined trumpeter Freddie Hubbard a year before graduation, serving as his Musical Director for eight years and contributing to albums like Double Take and Life Flight.[1][2]

Relocating to New York, Allen established himself as a prolific sideman, recording over 225 albums with masters including Jackie McLean (Dynasty), Donald Harrison (Indian Blues, Nouveau Swing), Donald Byrd (A City Called Heaven), Art Farmer (The Company I Keep), Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter, Branford Marsalis, George Coleman, Phil Woods, and Christian McBride.[1][2][3][5] His soulful, syncopated drumming style propelled his career as a bandleader, with leader albums like The Pursuer (1994) and Testimonial (1995), and co-led projects such as Get Ready (2007) and Work to Do (2009) with Rodney Whitaker.[3] In 1988, he co-founded Big Apple Productions with Vincent Herring, producing over 70 albums for artists like Freddie Hubbard and Pharoah Sanders.[3][4]

Allen’s legacy extends to education and entrepreneurship; he joined The Juilliard School faculty in 2001, serving as Artistic Director of Jazz Studies from 2008 to 2014, and is currently the William D. and Mary Grant/Missouri Endowed Professor of Jazz Studies at UMKC Conservatory.[2][3] He received an honorary doctorate from Snow College in 2012 and formed The Art of Elvin in 2014 to honor Art Blakey and Elvin Jones.[3][4] Based in New York, Allen continues to lead workshops, perform, and shape jazz through his multifaceted contributions.[1][5]
