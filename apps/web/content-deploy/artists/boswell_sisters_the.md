## Biography
The Boswell Sisters—Martha (born June 9, 1905, Kansas City, Missouri), Connie (born 1907, Kansas City), and Helvetia 'Vet' (born 1911, Birmingham, Alabama)—moved to New Orleans as children, where they were immersed in the city's burgeoning jazz scene. Classically trained on instruments like piano (Martha), cello and saxophone (Connie), and violin, banjo, and guitar (Vet), they were influenced by their older brother's interest in jazz and their mother's encouragement to explore local music varieties. Initially performing instrumentally, including with the New Orleans Philharmonic, they transitioned to singing by 1925, discovering their signature close harmonies during a radio broadcast when Connie, weakened by a cold, sang softly into a microphone, pioneering its use for intimate vocal effects.[1][2][3][5]

Their career surged in the late 1920s through vaudeville tours, leading to California and national fame by 1930 via radio, films like *The Big Broadcast* (1932) and *Moulin Rouge* (1934), and recordings. Known for intricate harmonies, scat singing, instrumental imitations, tempo shifts, and relaxed swing tempos, they blended classical precision with jazz innovation, with Connie as lead vocalist often seated due to polio, harmonized by Martha at piano and standing Vet. Peak success came from 1930-1935 before disbanding as Connie pursued a solo career.[1][3][4][5]

Though forgotten post-1930s, their 1980s reissues revived interest, cementing their legacy as vocal jazz pioneers who influenced swing and popularized microphone techniques, softening ground for the swing era.[1][3][4]
