## Biography
The Jolly Boys are a Jamaican mento band that has been integral to Port Antonio's musical landscape for nearly sixty years. The group quickly rose to local prominence in the 1950s as the house band for the Rat Pack's Jamaica chapter, chaired by actor Errol Flynn, where they performed songs of double entendre and ribaldry for tourists and the traveling elite at private soirées and hotels. Serving as Port Antonio's go-to band for thirty years, the Jolly Boys became masters of mento, one of Jamaica's original musical styles that significantly influenced reggae and ska. Being "discovered" by a new generation of world music aficionados in the late 1980s allowed the band to take their musical party on the road, touring dozens of countries over the following three decades and becoming the most recognizable mento band in the world.

In 2009, the Jolly Boys underwent a creative reinvention when Jon Baker, founder of Gee Street Records and former A&R leader at Island Records, held a recording session at Geejam Studios to capture and modernize their vintage material. Working with co-producer Dale Virgo and mento scholar Daniel Neely, the band created innovative arrangements that blended their traditional sound—defined by banjos, maracas, and rumba boxes—with contemporary beats. This evolution resulted in their album "Great Expectation" and introduced new members including Lenford "Brutus" Richards on guitar and Donald Waugh on banjo. The band's lineup has evolved over the decades while maintaining its core identity, with Albert Minott serving as lead vocalist and guitarist since 2010, continuing the legacy of original founding member Moses Deans.
