## Biography
Lord Nelson, born Robert Alphonso Nelson on July 27, 1931, in Plymouth, Tobago, grew up in a culturally rich environment that fueled his passion for music. After high school, he moved to Brooklyn, New York, but was soon drafted into the US Army and served in Korea, where he discovered his talents for singing and comedy through Army shows. Returning to the US, he performed with West Indian steel bands, covering calypso hits, and began writing his own songs after mentorship from calypsonian Mighty Duke.[1][2][3]

Nelson rose to prominence in the 1960s and 1970s, blending traditional calypso with American funk, soul, and emerging soca elements to create energetic, catchy tunes like 'Disco Daddy,' 'Meh Lover,' 'La La,' and 'King Liar.' His style addressed social issues such as racism, colonialism, and corruption with humor and wit, earning him hits across the Caribbean and international acclaim. In 1989, he won the Uncrowned King title at Trinidad's Carnival for off-island artists, and in 1990 signed with Shanachie Records, expanding his global reach with albums like 'When the World Turns Around.'[2][3]

A pioneer of soca, Nelson's legacy includes honors like a 2019 Lifetime Achievement Award and a 2022 honorary Doctor of Letters from the University of the West Indies. At age 94 in 2025, he continued performing, advocating for education through songs like 'UWI Graduation' and influencing Caribbean music's evolution.[1][2][4]
