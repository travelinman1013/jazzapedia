## Biography
Mount Kimbie is an English electronic music and indie rock group formed in 2008 by Dominic 'Dom' Maker from Chichester and Kai Campos from Cornwall, who met while studying at Southbank University in London—Campos pursuing music for the second time and Maker studying film. They began producing music in a home studio in Peckham, drawing from the UK dubstep scene but expanding it with experimental rhythms blending wonky, hip-hop, and ambient soundscapes, as heard in their critically acclaimed early EPs *Maybes* (2009) and *Sketch on Glass* (2009). Their debut album *Crooks & Lovers* (2010) solidified their reputation, topping numerous best-of-the-decade lists from outlets like Pitchfork, Mixmag, and DJ Mag, marking them as pioneers of post-dubstep.[1][2][7]

Signing to Warp Records in 2012, Mount Kimbie evolved their sound across subsequent albums including *Cold Spring Fault Less Youth* (2013), *Love What Survives* (2017), and *The Sunset Violent* (2024), shifting toward indie rock elements with live instrumentation. Drummer Marc Pell (formerly of Micachu and the Shapes) and keyboardist Andrea Balency-Béarn joined as live members in 2016, becoming full members in 2023 ahead of *The Sunset Violent*, recorded partly in a disused frat house in Yucca Valley, USA. The duo's solo pursuits enriched their style: Campos curates techno DJ sets and mixes like DJ-Kicks (2018), while Maker, now LA-based, produces for artists like James Blake and Travis Scott.[1][2][5]

Mount Kimbie's legacy lies in bridging electronic and indie realms, influencing London's post-punk revival and performing at prestigious venues like Tate Modern, Barbican, Coachella, and Glastonbury. Their music, characterized by samples, found sounds, and emotional depth, has cultivated a global fanbase, with *The Sunset Violent* continuing their innovative trajectory.[1][2]

## Fun Facts
- Mount Kimbie's fourth album *The Sunset Violent* was partially recorded in a disused frat house in Yucca Valley, USA, reflecting the distance between LA-based Dom Maker and London-based Kai Campos.[5]
- Kai Campos' breakthrough into production came from his music teacher demonstrating multi-track tape recording, leading him to abandon improving at drums for self-recording.[3][4]
- Dom Maker's family background emphasized academia—his parents were teachers—making music initially feel like just a hobby before committing fully.[4]
- The band has performed at art institutions like Tate Modern, MoMA PS1, and Barbican, alongside festivals such as Primavera and Coachella.[2]
