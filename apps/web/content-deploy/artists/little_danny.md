## Biography
Danny Wilkerson, known professionally in contexts aligning with 'Little Danny' on Spotify, was born and raised in Fort Worth, Texas, where he developed a passion for music from a young age. Inspired by The Beatles, he and childhood friends imitated the Fab Four using makeshift instruments like guitars from balsa wood and drums from hat boxes. He began learning drums in middle school and received his first orange sparkle drum kit on his 13th birthday, forming a band the next day. In high school, he gigged with various Texas bands, wrote an entertainment column for his school newspaper reviewing records and interviewing artists, dabbled in concert lighting, and promoted shows for Concerts West.[1]

Wilkerson's career advanced when he joined The Pengwins as drummer and vocalist after running sound for them. The band, featuring key member Lannie Flowers, gained popularity with a mix of covers and originals mostly written by Danny and Lannie. They toured extensively across the US (Colorado, Kansas, Arkansas), Europe (including the UK), and opened for acts like Cheap Trick, Fabulous Thunderbirds, Joe Ely, Beach Boys, and even had Quiet Riot open for them. In 1985, Danny left to form Direct Management, managing The Pengwins and pursuing a record deal, leading to production work with Rick Derringer at Bearsville Studios. He later produced an album for 16-year-old country artist Emily Rogers in 2003, writing eight tracks, and played in cover bands like The Nurse, The Pickles, The Waltons with Lannie Flowers, and Generation Rumble. His style blends rock, pop, and covers with original songwriting, and he recorded at Abbey Road Studios and sang on a Weird Al Yankovic record.[1]

Wilkerson's legacy includes a versatile career as musician, manager, producer, and promoter, performing worldwide and contributing to diverse projects without achieving major commercial breakthrough but building a dedicated following through relentless touring and industry connections.
