## Biography
Charlie Apicella, a jazz guitarist from upstate New York, began his serious musical training in 1999 at the University of Massachusetts, where he studied composition and improvisation with Yusef Lateef and music history with Archie Shepp and Dr. Billy Taylor. Initially inspired by Wes Montgomery and Charlie Parker during college, he relocated to Brooklyn around 2011, immersing himself in the New York jazz scene. There, he honed his skills further, studying guitar with Pat Martino in 2014, who not only provided technical guidance but also career advice, encouraging Apicella's pursuit of a modern Chitlin' Circuit-style path with his band Iron City.[1][2][3][8]

Apicella leads Charlie Apicella & Iron City, a hard-bop organ trio known for its grooving, muscular sound drawing comparisons to Grant Green and Wes Montgomery. The band has released five or six albums, including Destiny Calling (2023) and Groove Machine, featuring hard bop originals and Blue Note classics, and has maintained a steady presence at venues like Blue Note New York since 2018, Arthur’s Tavern since 2022, and Il Porto since 2013. Voted into DownBeat Readers Polls for guitar in 2016 and 2018, Apicella has also produced solo releases and written masterclasses for DownBeat and Just Jazz Guitar, while directing Blues Alive and teaching via TrueFire and New York Jazz Workshop.[1][2][3][4][5][6]

His musical style emphasizes funky, bluesy hard bop with a bright, clean guitar tone that cuts through the organ trio format. In 2022, Apicella expanded into free improvisation by forming The Griots Speak with William Parker, Daniel Carter, and Juma Sultan, culminating in the collaborative album Destiny Calling, an experiment blending straight-ahead jazz with free improv. His legacy includes nine records on labels like Origin, Zoho, and his own CArlo Music, performances with legends like Dave Holland and Sonny Fortune, and a reputation as one of New York's most swinging guitarists.[1][2][3][6]
