## Biography
The Hawketts were an American R&B combo formed in New Orleans, Louisiana, in the early 1950s by a group of teenage musicians from the African American community. Comprised of Art Neville on lead vocals and piano (age 16 at the time), George Davis on alto sax, Alfred August on guitar, Israel Bell on trumpet, August Fleuri on trumpet, Carroll Joseph on trombone, Morris 'Moe' Bachemin on tenor sax, and John Boudreaux on drums, the band notably lacked a bass player, as the members were unaware it was conventional.[1][3] In 1953, they recruited Neville, who had been involved in high school doo-wop groups influenced by acts like the Clovers, the Spiders, Fats Domino, and Professor Longhair.[3][4]

The group's career peaked with their 1954 recording of 'Mardi Gras Mambo,' a song originally written in 1953 by Frankie Adams, Ken Elliot, and Lou Welsh (sometimes listed as Lou Welsch), which they adapted into an R&B hit with rhumba and Caribbean influences reflective of early New Orleans R&B. Recorded in January 1954 at local radio station WWEZ using just two microphones, the single on Chess Records became an iconic Carnival classic.[1][2] The Hawketts quickly became one of the hottest bands in New Orleans, performing at sororities, fraternities, nightclubs, and various functions.[3]

Following the success of their sole major release, most original members departed, but Art Neville kept a version of the band going briefly before his Navy service in the late 1950s. The Hawketts' legacy endures through 'Mardi Gras Mambo's' status as a New Orleans staple, launching Neville toward fame with the Meters and Neville Brothers, cementing their place in the city's R&B and funk heritage.[1][3][4]
