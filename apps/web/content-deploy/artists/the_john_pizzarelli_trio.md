## Biography
John Paul Pizzarelli Jr., born on April 6, 1960, in Paterson, New Jersey, grew up immersed in jazz as the son of legendary guitarist Bucky Pizzarelli and Ruth Pizzarelli. Starting guitar at age six, he formed his first band, Emanon, in 1974, playing rock tunes like Edgar Winter's 'Free Ride,' while absorbing his father's influences. By his early 20s, he performed alongside Bucky, recording his debut vocal album *I'm Hip (Please Don't Tell My Father)* in 1983 with the Bucky Pizzarelli Trio, blending guitar prowess with emerging vocal talents inspired by bossa nova and standards[1][2][3].

Pizzarelli launched his solo career after *My Blue Heaven* in 1990, touring clubs and halls, opening for Dave Brubeck, Ramsey Lewis, and Rosemary Clooney. In 1992, he formed the John Pizzarelli Trio with brother Martin on bass and pianist Ray Kennedy (replacing Ken Levinsky in 1993), achieving breakthroughs like opening for Frank Sinatra's 1993 tour and performing at Sinatra's 80th birthday at Carnegie Hall. His style fuses cool jazz guitar, swinging standards from the Great American Songbook, and innovative takes on Nat King Cole, Frank Sinatra, and bossa nova, with albums like *Dear Mr. Cole* (1994) and *Bossa Nova* (2004) showcasing his charm, humor, and spontaneity[1][2][3][4][5].

A Grammy winner as co-producer of James Taylor's *American Standard* (2021), Pizzarelli has recorded over 20 albums for labels like Chesky, Stash, RCA, and Telarc, starred in Broadway's *Dream* (1997), and co-hosts 'Radio Deluxe.' His legacy endures as a revivalist bridging classic jazz with contemporary audiences through TV appearances and fresh arrangements of Beatles, Joni Mitchell, and Paul McCartney tunes[3][4][5][6].
