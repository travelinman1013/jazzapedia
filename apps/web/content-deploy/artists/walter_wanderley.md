## Biography
Walter Wanderley (born Walter Jose Wanderley Mendonça, May 12, 1932 – September 4, 1986) was a Brazilian organist and pianist born in Recife, Brazil, who became one of the most successful instrumentalists of the bossa nova movement. He began his musical education remarkably early, playing piano at age five and attending the Licee of Arts at age 12 for formal theory training in harmony and arranging. Beginning his professional career in Recife's vibrant cultural scene, he worked extensively as both a pianist and organist while also establishing himself as an arranger and accompanist for numerous Brazilian singers including Isaurinha Garcia (whom he married), Marcos Valle, Tom Jobim, and João Donato.

Wanderley's international breakthrough came through the intervention of American singer Tony Bennett, who witnessed his playing during a Brazilian tour and recommended him to Verve Records producer Creed Taylor. This led to his relocation to the United States and a recording contract with Verve Records, where he recorded six albums between 1966 and 1968. His instrumental version of "Summer Samba" became a worldwide hit, reaching No. 26 on the Billboard charts in September 1966 and establishing him as a major figure in lounge and bossa nova music. He was renowned for his distinctive staccato stuttering style and masterful command of the Hammond B-3 organ, which gave bossa nova a revitalized energy during the mid-1960s.

Despite recording 46 solo albums throughout his career across both Brazilian and American labels (including Odeon, Philips, and Verve), Wanderley's legacy became complicated by his struggle with alcoholism, which increasingly affected his later career. He died of bone cancer on September 4, 1986, in San Francisco, California, at age 54, having largely faded from public consciousness. However, a decade after his death, he was rediscovered by a new generation of lounge music enthusiasts, leading to the reissue of many of his recordings on CD and a renewed appreciation for his contributions to Brazilian popular music.

## Fun Facts
- Wanderley was a child prodigy who began playing piano at just five years old and had already attended formal music theory classes by age 12, demonstrating exceptional musical talent from an early age.
- His breakthrough to international stardom was largely accidental—Tony Bennett discovered him during a Brazilian tour and personally championed his career to Verve Records, fundamentally changing the trajectory of his life.
- Despite his massive commercial success in the United States with 46 recorded solo albums and a Top 40 hit, Wanderley remained largely forgotten in his native Brazil and was practically omitted from the historiography of Brazilian Popular Music and Bossa Nova, a paradox that became the subject of an ethnomusicological research book.
- Wanderley was rediscovered by a new generation of music fans a full decade after his death in 1986, when lounge music enthusiasts began seeking out and reissuing his recordings on CD, giving his legacy a second life.
