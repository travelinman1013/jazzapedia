## Biography
Anjelika “Jelly” Joseph, a Grammy-nominated singer and songwriter from New Orleans, Louisiana, emerged as a versatile force in the city's eclectic music scene. Around age 31 (circa 2018-2019), she gained prominence as the backing vocalist and self-described 'hype-man' for Tank and The Bangas, contributing to their nomination for Best New Artist at the Grammys. Her powerful, soulful voice draws from R&B and soul traditions, blending vulnerability with strength, and she launched her solo career in recent years with tracks like 'Getcha Sum,' 'Get Left,' 'Love in Your Heart,' and 'My Favorite Ghost (Phantom Pains).' Joseph's style fuses contemporary R&B with NOLA funk, blues, and brass influences, reflecting her deep ties to the local music culture.[1][2][3][5]
