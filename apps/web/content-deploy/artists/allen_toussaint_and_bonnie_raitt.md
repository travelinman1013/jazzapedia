## Biography
Allen Toussaint, born and raised in New Orleans, Louisiana, began his musical career in the 1950s as a pianist, songwriter, and producer, deeply rooted in the city's rhythm and blues tradition. He released his first album in 1958 and quickly rose to prominence in the early 1960s as house producer for Minit Records, where he wrote, arranged, and produced hits like 'Mother-in-Law' for Ernie K-Doe, 'Ya Ya' for Lee Dorsey, 'It's Raining' for Irma Thomas, and 'I Like It Like That' for Chris Kenner. His style blended lively New Orleans R&B with wit, funk, and soulful rhythms, evolving from 1950s R&B to funkier sounds in the 1960s and 1970s.[1][4][5]

Partnering with Marshall Sehorn, Toussaint co-founded Sea-Saint Studios in 1972 (or 1973), which became a hub for artists like Paul McCartney, Paul Simon, the Band, LaBelle, and Little Feat. His solo career peaked mid-1970s with albums *From a Whisper to a Scream* and *Southern Nights*, the latter famously covered by Glen Campbell. He continued producing for acts like the Meters and Lee Dorsey, co-founded NYNO Records in 1996, and remained active in New Orleans music, earning inductions into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame (1998), Songwriters Hall of Fame, and Blues Hall of Fame (2011), plus the National Medal of Arts (2013).[2][3][4][5]

Toussaint's legacy as a 'master of New Orleans soul and R&B' endures through his prolific songwriting—over five decades, with hits covered by the Who, Rolling Stones, and others—his studio's influence, and post-Katrina efforts like co-founding New Orleans Artists Against Hunger and Homelessness with Aaron Neville. His music appeared in films (*The Wolf of Wall Street*, *Bridesmaids*) and TV (*The Wire*, *True Blood*). He passed away in 2015, but his self-effacing contributions elevated New Orleans music nationally.[1][3][4]
