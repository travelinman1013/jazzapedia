## Biography
Tito Puente, born Ernest Anthony Puente Jr. on April 20, 1923, in New York City to Puerto Rican parents, showed prodigious musical talent from a young age, performing in a song-and-dance duo with his sister Anna in the 1930s and learning percussion basics from Afro-Cuban drummers like those in Los Happy Boys. Initially aspiring to dance, an ankle injury shifted his focus to music; by age 13, he was a recognized prodigy, playing with bands such as Ramon Oliver’s and later replacing the drafted drummer in Machito’s band at 16. During World War II, Puente served three years in the U.S. Navy aboard the USS Santee, where he played saxophone, clarinet, and drums while honing big band arranging skills under Lieutenant Sweeney, earning a Presidential Unit Citation for his service in battles like Leyte and Midway.[1][2][4]

After his 1945 discharge, Puente used G.I. Bill funds to study at Juilliard, forming his Tito Puente Orchestra in 1948, which evolved into a powerhouse blending mambo, Latin jazz, cha-cha, merengue, bossa nova, and salsa with big-band flair. His 1958 breakthrough album Dance Mania and hits like 'Oye Como Va' (later popularized by Carlos Santana), 'Ran Kan Kan,' and 'Babarabatiri' established him as the 'King of Latin Jazz' or 'El Rey de los Timbales,' innovating by playing timbales standing at the front of the stage. Over five decades, he released over 100 albums, composed 200+ works, collaborated with jazz icons like George Shearing and Woody Herman, and won five Grammy Awards, including for Homenaje a Beny (1979) and Mambo Birdland (2000).[1][2][5]

Puente's legacy as a musical pioneer endures through his fusion of Latin rhythms with jazz and popular culture, earning honors like the New York City key (1969), Smithsonian's James Smithson Bicentennial Medal (1993), and International Latin Music Hall of Fame induction (1999); he passed away on May 31, 2000. La India (Linda Viera Caballero), a salsa singer known as the 'Princess of Salsa,' collaborated with Puente among other legends like Celia Cruz, though specific joint projects under 'Tito Puente & La India' appear tied to select recordings amid their shared salsa orbits.[1][2][3]
