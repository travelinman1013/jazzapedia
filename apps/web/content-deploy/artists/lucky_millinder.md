## Biography
Lucius Venable "Lucky" Millinder (August 8, 1910 – September 28, 1966) was an American swing and rhythm-and-blues bandleader born in Anniston, Alabama, and raised in Chicago. Despite his inability to read or write music, play an instrument, or sing regularly, Millinder became one of the most successful bandleaders of his era through exceptional showmanship and musical taste. He began his career in the 1920s working as a master of ceremonies and dancer in Chicago clubs and theaters, fronting his first band in 1931 for an RKO theater tour. In 1932, he took over Doc Crawford's orchestra in Harlem, and by 1933, he was leading bands in Europe with residencies in Monte Carlo and Paris.

Millinder's most significant period came after 1934 when he took leadership of the Mills Blue Rhythm Band at The Cotton Club in New York, featuring accomplished musicians like Henry "Red" Allen, Charlie Shavers, and Harry "Sweets" Edison. By 1940, he formed his own Lucky Millinder Orchestra and established a residency at New York's Savoy Ballroom, which became the foundation of his greatest success. His band achieved major commercial success with hits including "When the Lights Go On Again (All Over the World)" (1942), which reached number 1 on the R&B chart and number 14 on the pop chart, and "Who Threw the Whiskey in the Well" (1945), which stayed at number 1 on the R&B chart for eight weeks and reached number 7 on the pop chart. By the mid-1940s, his orchestra had shifted stylistically toward rhythm and blues, moving away from the jazz format of Cab Calloway and Count Basie.

Millinder's band was renowned as the greatest big band to play rhythm and blues and served as a launching pad for numerous musicians who became influential in the rock and roll era. The band's last major hit was "I'm Waiting Just for You" (1951) with singer Annisteen Allen, reaching number 2 on the R&B chart. Millinder effectively retired from performing around 1955, though he made final recordings in 1960, and subsequently worked as a radio DJ, in music publishing, and in public relations. He was inducted into the Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame in 1986 and died of a liver ailment in Harlem, New York, in September 1966.
