## Biography
Melvin Lincoln Davis was born on August 29, 1942, in Georgia and moved to Detroit at age three, where he would become one of the most versatile and prolific figures in Motor City music history. Inspired by Little Richard's performances at a juke joint on his grandparents' farm and gospel music from his family's Baptist church—including groups like the Soul Stirrers featuring Sam Cooke—Davis developed a deep musical foundation. After joining the Navy at seventeen, he learned piano and subsequently began his recording career in 1961 with his first single "I Don't Want You" / "About Love" on the Jack Pot label, establishing himself as a songwriter, drummer, performer, producer, arranger, and eventually label owner.

Throughout the 1960s and beyond, Davis became a musical force across Detroit's independent and major labels, recording for Fortune, Ke Ke, Wheel City, Groovesville, Mala, Golden State, and later Holland-Dozier-Holland's Invictus label. As a Motown staff drummer, he performed with Smokey Robinson & The Miracles, The Temptations, Martha Reeves & The Vandellas, and The Supremes, with his drumming helping define the Miracles' smash hit "Tears Of A Clown." His most significant commercial success came with the million-seller "You've Got To Crawl (Before You Walk)" by the 8th Day on the Invictus label. Davis became a cornerstone of the northern soul genre, penning crucial songs like "Find A Quiet Place (And Be Lonely)" and "I Must Love You," while also exploring Detroit's rockin' soul aesthetic through recordings on independent labels.

Davis's legacy extends far beyond his own recordings—he has written approximately 600 songs across his career, worked with seven record labels, and established his own label, Rock Mill Record, in 1976. His contributions to Detroit music have been formally recognized through his induction into the Detroit Rhythm and Blues Hall of Fame and a lifetime achievement award from the Detroit Music Awards. Few artists in Detroit's soul music scene have maintained such an impressive and diverse résumé, spanning multiple decades and influencing the development of northern soul and Detroit's broader musical landscape.
