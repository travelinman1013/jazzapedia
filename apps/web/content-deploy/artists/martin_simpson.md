## Biography
Martin Stewart Simpson, born on 5 May 1953 in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, England, developed an early passion for music, learning guitar and banjo from age twelve and performing at local folk clubs. By fifteen, he was playing professionally, attending blues festivals where he met legends like Big Joe Williams, and in 1970, he dropped out of John Leggott College to pursue music full-time. His debut solo album, Golden Vanity, arrived in 1976, followed by tours opening for Steeleye Span and performances with Ashley Hutchings’ Albion Band in 1979, establishing him as a key figure in British folk.[1][2][4]

Simpson's career evolved through diverse collaborations and explorations, including three albums with vocalist June Tabor in the late 1970s and 1980s, a groundbreaking 1995 session with Chinese pipa player Wu Man on Music for the Motherless Child, and cross-cultural works like Kambara Music in Native Tongues with David Hidalgo of Los Lobos and Viji Krishnan. His style blends traditional English, Irish, American, and global influences with masterful acoustic and slide guitar, banjo, and sparse picking techniques, often focusing on storytelling through folk songs from the Deep South or British traditions, as heard in albums like Righteousness and Humidity (2003), The Bramble Briar (2001), and Prodigal Son (2007). He co-founded High Bohemia label with Jessica Radcliffe in 1999 and continues releasing acclaimed work, including Skydancers in 2024.[1][2][3][4]

Renowned as one of the world's finest acoustic guitarists—ranked in Gibson's Top 30 and Acoustic Guitar's top 12—Simpson's legacy includes 32 BBC Radio 2 Folk Award nominations (most ever), wins for Artist of the Year (twice), Best Musician (2004), Album of the Year for Prodigal Son (2008), and Best Original Song for 'Never Any Good'. His prolific output spans over 50 albums as solo artist, collaborator, and session musician, influencing folk guitar with eclectic, emotive interpretations.[2][3][6]
