## Biography
Jonathan Michael Batiste, born November 11, 1986, in Metairie, Louisiana, grew up immersed in New Orleans' rich musical heritage as part of the renowned Batiste musical family. At age eight, he played percussion and drums with the Batiste Brothers Band before switching to piano at 11. He attended the New Orleans Center for Creative Arts, graduating in 2004, and later studied jazz at The Juilliard School, earning a bachelor's degree in 2008 and a master's in 2011. His early career included performances across Europe and the release of albums like *Times in New Orleans* (2005) and *Live in New York: At the Rubin Museum of Art* (2006).[1][2][4]

Batiste rose to prominence forming the band Stay Human in 2005 with Juilliard peers, including bassist Phil Kuehn, drummer Joe Saylor, saxophonist Eddie Barbash, and tuba player Ibanda Ruhumbika, blending jazz, funk, R&B, and New Orleans roots to promote human connection through live music. From 2015 to 2022, he served as bandleader and musical director on *The Late Show with Stephen Colbert*, boosting his visibility. Key works include co-composing the score for Pixar's *Soul* (2020) with Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, earning an Academy Award, Golden Globe, Grammy, and BAFTA; and his album *We Are* (2021), which won Album of the Year at the 2022 Grammys. His style fuses traditional jazz with pop, blues, R&B, and classical elements, as seen in later releases like *World Music Radio* (2023), *Beethoven Blues* (2024), and *Big Money* (2025).[1][2]

Batiste's legacy encompasses music education, serving as Creative Director of the National Jazz Museum in Harlem and on Juilliard's board since 2022. With eight Grammy wins from 25 nominations, performances at major events like the Super Bowl LIX national anthem (2025), and compositions for films and documentaries like *American Symphony* (2023), he continues to innovate across genres while advocating for social causes through music.[1][2][3]
