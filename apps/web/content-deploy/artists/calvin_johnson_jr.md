## Biography
Calvin Johnson, Jr., born November 21, 1985, in New Orleans, Louisiana, grew up immersed in music as a third-generation musician from a family with deep roots in jazz, gospel, classical, and funk. His paternal grandfather, George 'Son' Johnson, was a clarinetist, saxophonist, pianist, composer, arranger, and teacher who led WPA bands during the Great Depression and taught at the Grunewald School of Music. Johnson nurtured his passion at the New Orleans Center for Creative Arts (NOCCA), studying alongside peers like Trombone Shorty, Christian Scott, and Jon Batiste, and later at the Louis Armstrong Summer Jazz Camp and the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Foundation’s School of Music. Despite maintaining a full-time music career, he earned a B.S. in Business from the University of New Orleans. Hurricane Katrina in 2005 profoundly impacted him, leaving him city-less, homeless, and gig-less, solidifying his commitment to music as his livelihood.[1][2][3][5]

Johnson's career as a saxophonist, composer, bandleader, producer, and actor blends contemporary and traditional New Orleans jazz. He leads the band Native Son, formed in 2008, with albums including the self-titled sophomore release (2015, voted top release by Offbeat Magazine) and Notes of a Native Son (2022), showcasing his arranging skills. His debut, Jewel's Lullaby (2012), was inspired by lullabies for his daughter and featured NOCCA friends Nathan Lambertson (bass), Courtney Bryan (piano), and Joe Dyson (drums). He has toured and recorded with luminaries like Harry Connick Jr., Aaron Neville, Preservation Hall Jazz Band, Dirty Dozen Brass Band, Irvin Mayfield, New Orleans Jazz Orchestra, Blind Boys of Alabama, Irma Thomas, Mannie Fresh, and Mystikal. His style marks his 'native tongue' amid post-Katrina cultural shifts.[1][2][3][7]

Deeply committed to education and community, Johnson serves as artistic director of Trumpets Not Guns, a nonprofit providing instruments to youth; faculty at Louis 'Satchmo' Armstrong Jazz Camp; clinician for Preservation Hall Foundation; and mentor via Louis Armstrong Educational Foundation and New Orleans Public Schools. He also sits on the board of the Music and Culture Coalition of New Orleans (MaCCNO), advocating for cultural preservation. His legacy preserves New Orleans music traditions while fostering the next generation.[1][2][3]
