## Biography
Gene Harris, born Eugene Haire on September 1, 1933, in Benton Harbor, Michigan, discovered his love for music early, teaching himself piano at age six and receiving mentorship from local trumpeter Charles Metcalf, who introduced him to boogie-woogie styles of Pete Johnson and Albert Ammons. After serving in the US Army Band during the Korean War (1951-1954), he formed the groundbreaking soul jazz trio The Three Sounds in 1956 with bassist Andy Simpkins and drummer Bill Dowdy, recording prolifically for Blue Note and Verve through the 1960s, blending blues, gospel, hard bop, and cool jazz into a richly chordal, rhythmic sound that gained international acclaim.[1][2][4][7] In the late 1960s, band members departed, but Harris continued with larger configurations before announcing semi-retirement in 1977 and relocating to Boise, Idaho, where he mentored local musicians and performed regularly at the Idanha Hotel.[2][5]

Harris's career resurgence began in the 1980s, spurred by Ray Brown, leading to tours with Brown's trio until 1992, a Grammy-nominated appearance on Milt Jackson's 1983 album Soul Routes, and leadership of the Philip Morris Superband (1989-1991) featuring stars like Ray Charles and B.B. King. By the early 1990s, he formed the Gene Harris Quartet, incorporating guitarist Ron Eschete for a swinging sound rooted in his earlier collaborations, releasing acclaimed albums on Concord Jazz and earning another Grammy nomination in 1988 for a Count Basie tribute. His style—warm, blues-infused, and gospel-tinged—remained accessible and exuberant, influencing soul jazz while maintaining straight-ahead jazz sophistication until his death on January 16, 2000, at age 66.[1][2][3][5]

Harris's legacy endures through over 22 albums post-retirement, his role in pioneering soul jazz via The Three Sounds, and his Boise residency, where he became a local icon bridging jazz enthusiasts and newcomers with lively performances that created deep listener connections.[2][5]
