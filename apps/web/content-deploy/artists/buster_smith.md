## Biography
Henry Franklin 'Buster' Smith, also known as Professor Smith, was born on August 24, 1904, in Alsdorf, Texas, into a musical family where his father played guitar. He began on piano and organ before switching to clarinet and alto saxophone in his late teens. In 1922, his family moved to Dallas, and by 1923, Smith launched his professional career with medicine shows, playing loudly to attract crowds, which shaped his bold, powerful style. This led to his invitation in 1925 by Oran 'Hot Lips' Page to join the Oklahoma City Blue Devils, featuring luminaries like Walter Page, Lester Young, Count Basie, and Jimmy Rushing. Smith composed much of the band's music during their Midwest tours, elevating the group's prominence in the Kansas City jazz scene[1][2][5].

After the Blue Devils, Smith co-led the Buster Smith-Count Basie Band of Rhythm in the early 1930s, pioneering the 'Texas Sax Sound' by using a tenor reed in his alto saxophone for a louder, fatter tone, matched by Lester Young's baritone reed on tenor. He also worked with Bennie Moten, Claude Hopkins, and briefly as Basie's staff arranger. In the 1930s, Smith mentored Charlie Parker in a father-son-like relationship. By 1941, he settled in Dallas, ceasing tours but staying active by writing for jazz and blues bands, performing sessions with groups like Pete Johnson's Boogie-Woogie Boys and the Don Redman Orchestra, and teaching local talents[1][2][4][5].

In 1959, Atlantic Records prompted Smith's first solo album, *The Legendary Buster Smith*, recorded in Fort Worth with his brother Boston on piano and career-spanning musicians, featuring tracks like 'Kansas City Riffs' and 'Buster's Tune.' A 1960s auto accident ended his saxophone playing, so he switched to bass guitar, leading a dance band until 1980 and playing with the Legendary Revelations in the mid-1980s. Smith died of a heart attack in Dallas on August 10, 1991, leaving a legacy as a stylistic innovator and mentor in Texas jazz[1][2][3].
