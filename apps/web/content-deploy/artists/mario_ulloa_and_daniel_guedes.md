## Biography
Mario Ulloa & Daniel Guedes is a Brazilian–Costa Rican classical crossover duo for violin and guitar that focuses on sophisticated arrangements of Brazilian popular music and Latin American repertoire. The partnership brings together Brazilian violinist, violist, conductor, and chamber musician Daniel Guedes and Costa Rican classical guitarist Mario Ulloa, an established interpreter and dedicatee of contemporary Latin American guitar music.[1][4][6] Their work highlights styles such as **bossa nova**, **samba**, **choro**, and **bolero**, adapted for the intimate combination of bowed strings and nylon‑string guitar.[1]

Born in Rio de Janeiro in 1977, Daniel Guedes began studying violin with his father and later trained at the Brazilian Conservatory of Music before continuing his studies at the Guildhall School of Music in London and the Manhattan School of Music in New York, where he worked closely with Pinchas Zukerman and Patinka Kopec.[1][2] As his international solo and chamber career developed, Guedes also became active as a conductor and educator in Brazil, all while exploring chamber formats such as the long‑standing Guanabara String Quartet and his violin–guitar duo with Mario Ulloa.[1][2] Ulloa, born on March 17, 1965, in Costa Rica, built a reputation as a high‑level classical guitarist, performing and recording contemporary and Brazilian‑influenced repertoire and being named among the dedicatees and key interpreters for Brazilian composer and guitarist Paulo Porto Alegre.[4][6] Around the early 2010s the Ulloa–Guedes duo recorded at least two albums—*Guitar and Violin* and *Amor em Paz (Love in Peace)*—distributed digitally on platforms such as Spotify, presenting refined, concert‑level renditions of popular Brazilian songs and instrumental standards.[1][2][3][6]

Within their joint discography, Mario Ulloa & Daniel Guedes position the violin–guitar duo as a bridge between classical technique and popular idioms, often choosing well‑known Brazilian songs and shaping them into chamber pieces suited to recital halls and concert venues.[1][2] This has contributed modestly but distinctly to the visibility of Brazilian popular music in classical guitar and violin circles, especially in Latin America and among listeners who encounter their recordings via streaming and video platforms.[1][2][3][6] Although the duo does not appear to function as a continuously touring act, their recordings and documented performances reflect a shared aesthetic: transparent textures, lyrical phrasing, and a focus on Brazilian and Latin American idioms rendered with classical discipline and expressive subtlety.[1][2][5][6]

## Fun Facts
- The duo’s albums *Guitar and Violin* and *Amor em Paz (Love in Peace)* are built around Brazilian genres such as bossa nova, samba, choro, and bolero, unusually presented in a refined concert‑music format for violin and classical guitar.[1][2]
- Mario Ulloa is not Brazilian but Costa Rican, making the duo a cross‑national Latin American collaboration that blends Brazilian repertoire with a Central American guitar tradition.[2][4][6]
- Composer–guitarist Paulo Porto Alegre explicitly dedicates part of his recorded repertoire to Mario Ulloa, listing him among the principal interpreters of his works—an indication of Ulloa’s stature in contemporary Latin American guitar circles even beyond his duo with Guedes.[4]
- A YouTube channel under Daniel Guedes’s name features Mario Ulloa performing Joaquín Rodrigo’s *Concierto de Aranjuez* (2nd movement), illustrating how their collaboration extends beyond studio albums into concerto and video projects.[5]
