## Biography
Morris Pejoe, born Morris Pejas on April 11, 1924, in Palmetto, St. Landry Parish, Louisiana, was a blues guitarist and singer who became a notable figure in blues scholarship despite limited mainstream recognition. Originally trained as a violinist, he transitioned to guitar in the late 1940s, developing a distinctive musical style that blended country and urban blues influences. His career reflected the dual nature of his artistry—rooted in Louisiana's rural blues traditions while incorporating elements of city blues aesthetics.

Pejoe's personal life intersected with the blues community through his marriage to blues singer Mary Lane, with whom he had children including Lynne Lane. He performed throughout his career, earning recognition among blues scholars and enthusiasts as a significant but often overlooked figure in the genre's history. Pejoe continued performing until his death on July 27, 1982, at age 58 in Westland, Michigan, leaving behind a legacy as a musician whose work exemplified the convergence of country and urban blues traditions.
