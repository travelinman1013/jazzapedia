## Biography
Exit 9 was an American soul-funk band formed around 1973 in the United States, evolving from a guitar-based combo originally called Qualified Funk. The young musicians, aged 16 to 20 at the time, expanded to a nine-piece ensemble with a three-piece brass section, prompting the name change to Exit 9 under new management by John Jenkins and Modeste Clarke. They secured a deal with Brunswick-subsidiary BRC and released their only album, *Straight Up*, in 1975, featuring songs primarily written by guitarist Hollis Googe and vocalist Johnny Rios, including tracks like 'Jive Man,' 'Thoughts of You,' and 'Miss Funky Fox.'[2][3]

The band's musical style blended soul, funk, and rock elements, characterized by tight horn arrangements, groovy basslines, and energetic vocals, capturing the vibrant mid-1970s funk scene. Produced by their management team with assistance from Alonzo Johnson, *Straight Up* showcased their raw talent but did not lead to further releases, marking a brief but notable career in the competitive funk landscape.[2]

Exit 9's legacy endures among funk enthusiasts and collectors for their obscure yet high-quality output, with members like guitarists Hollis Googe and David Lavender later contributing to other projects—Googe on Pulse's 1981 single 'Don’t Stop the Magic' and Lavender on Sly Fox's 1985 album *Let’s Go All The Way*. Their singular album remains a sought-after rarity in soul-funk discography.[2]
