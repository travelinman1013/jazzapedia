## Biography
Lloyd Charmers, born Lloyd Tyrell (also spelled Terrell or Terell) on April 18, 1946, in Kingston, Jamaica, began his musical career in 1962 during Jamaica's Independence Year as part of the vocal duo the Charmers with Roy Willis, performing on Vere Johns' Talent Hour and recording hits with producers like Coxsone Dodd and Prince Buster, including 'Time After Time' and 'Oh Marie.' Guided early by Alton Ellis, who refined their harmonies, Charmers transitioned through ska and rocksteady, joining the influential trio the Uniques in 1967 with Slim Smith and Jimmy Riley, delivering classics like 'My Conversation,' 'Watch This Sound,' and 'People Rock Steady.' His style evolved into sophisticated soul-infused reggae, marked by falsetto vocals, organ playing, and pioneering sexually explicit 'slackness' lyrics in tracks like 'Bang Bang Lulu,' 'Birth Control,' and 'Yum Yum Pussy,' released under aliases like Lloydie and the Lowbites on his Censored albums.[1][2][3][4]

In the late 1960s, Charmers formed the session band Hippy Boys—featuring Aston 'Family Man' Barrett, Carlton Barrett, Glen Adams, and Alva Lewis—releasing the landmark instrumental album Psychedelic Reggae and hits like 'Zylon,' which later evolved into Lee 'Scratch' Perry's Upsetters. Entering production in the early 1970s, he founded the Splash Records label, yielding massive successes such as Ken Boothe's UK No. 1 'Everything I Own' (1974) and 'Crying Over You,' alongside work with artists like the Gaylads, B.B. Seaton, and Lloyd Parks using his Now Generation band. His productions stood out for intricate arrangements blending reggae with soul covers of artists like Isaac Hayes and Marvin Gaye, spanning ska, rocksteady, early reggae, lovers rock, and roots.[1][2][3]

Relocating to Britain in the late 1970s, Charmers continued recording and producing across lovers rock and disco until his death on December 27, 2012. His 50-year legacy as a versatile singer, keyboardist, songwriter, and producer—often undervalued—shaped Jamaican music's soulful, oily sound and introduced X-rated themes predating dancehall slackness, influencing global reggae appreciation through UK licensing deals with Pama and Trojan.[1][2][3][4]
