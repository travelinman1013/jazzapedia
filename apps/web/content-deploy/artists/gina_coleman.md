## Biography
Gina Coleman was born and raised in the South Bronx, New York, in a predominantly Puerto Rican and African American community rich with R&B, salsa, and gospel music.[1][4] She received piano lessons from her grandfather starting at age 5, but her singing career began unexpectedly in 1990 when coworkers dared her to perform at an open mic night.[1][2] Performing a cappella rendition of Janis Joplin's "Mercedes Benz," she won $75 and the audience's standing ovation, launching her into the music scene.[1][5] A graduate of Williams College, Coleman initially performed as part of the acoustic duo The Siblings with guitarist Dave Lincoln, before forming the five-piece acoustic funk/folk band Cole-Connection in the early-to-mid 1990s, which became popular throughout western Massachusetts for their energetic medley performances.[1][2][4]

Coleman's pivotal moment came in 1999 when she performed as a gospel blues singer in the Williamstown Theatre Festival production of "A Raisin in the Sun," alongside acclaimed actors including Viola Davis and Ruben Santiago-Hudson.[1][3] Santiago-Hudson recognized her vocal potential for blues and gifted her a transformative CD collection titled "Men Are Like Streetcars" featuring 22 female blues artists from 1928 to 1969.[1][5] This encounter redirected her musical trajectory entirely. Coleman approached the remaining members of Cole-Connection and proposed transitioning to blues music, resulting in the formation of Misty Blues in 1999.[1][4] The band initially performed almost exclusively from the "Men Are Like Streetcars" collection, paying homage to classic female blues artists, before Coleman began writing original material.[4]

Over 25 years, Misty Blues evolved into a critically recognized ensemble, becoming a 2019 International Blues Challenge finalist.[1] Coleman serves as the band's founder, lead singer, songwriter, and cigarbox guitar performer, leading a rotating lineup of accomplished musicians including keyboardist Benny "Fingers" Kohn, bassist Bill Patriquin, drummer Rob Tatten, guitarists Seth Fleischmann and Jason Webster, and saxophonist Aaron Dean.[1][6][7] The band performs original compositions alongside traditional blues infused with jazz, soul, funk, and tent revival gospel influences.[1][2] Coleman's artistic philosophy emphasizes the blues as a vessel for authentic emotional expression and personal freedom, drawing inspiration from blues legends Bessie Smith, Billie Holiday, and Janis Joplin.[2][6]

## Fun Facts
- Coleman's first singing performance was entirely unplanned—she was dared by coworkers to perform at an open mic night in 1990 and sang only because she had consumed alcohol for 'liquid encouragement,' initially asserting she wasn't a singer.[1]
- During the 1999 Williamstown Theatre Festival production of "A Raisin in the Sun," Coleman spent most of the show hanging on a fire escape rigged across the main stage, as the director specifically cast her as an African-American gospel blues singer.[6]
- The transformative CD collection "Men Are Like Streetcars" that redirected Coleman's career contained 22 songs by female blues artists spanning from 1928 to 1969, and Misty Blues initially performed almost exclusively from this collection when the band formed in 1999.[1][5]
- Misty Blues was founded in Williamstown, Massachusetts—a town better known as a theater and folk music hotbed than a blues destination, making it an unlikely birthplace for a blues band that would later become a 2019 International Blues Challenge finalist.[6]
