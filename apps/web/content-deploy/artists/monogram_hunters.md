## Biography
The Monogram Hunters are a Black Masking Indian tribe from the 7th Ward of New Orleans, deeply rooted in the city's vibrant Mardi Gras Indian culture. Founded by Alfred Montana, widely regarded as the father of the modern Black Masking Indian tradition, the tribe embodies the spirit of second-line parades, elaborate suits, and rhythmic percussion-driven music performed during Carnival season.[3][2] Revived in 1991 by Big Chief Tyrone “Pie” Stevenson, the group continues Montana's legacy, blending oral histories, chants, and traditional Indian songs to preserve and celebrate their cultural heritage.[4][2]
