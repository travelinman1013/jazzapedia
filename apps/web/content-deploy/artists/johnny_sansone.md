## Biography
John Sansone, known professionally as Jumpin' Johnny Sansone, was born on September 27, 1957, in West Orange, New Jersey, to a musically inclined family—his father was a saxophone-playing schoolteacher who performed in Dave Brubeck's Wolf Pack band. Sansone's blues journey began early; at age 13, he sat in with blues legend Honeyboy Edwards, and during the 1970s he studied harmonica under blues legends James Cotton and Jr. Wells. In the 1980s, he toured extensively with Chicago blues icons including Ronnie Earl, John Lee Hooker, Jimmy Rodgers, and Robert Lockwood Jr., establishing himself as a skilled harmonicist and guitarist in the fierce Mississippi Delta blues tradition.

After years of itinerant touring through Colorado, Austin, Texas, Florida, and Chicago, Sansone settled in New Orleans in 1990, a decision that fundamentally transformed his musical identity. His early work with Jumpin' Johnny & the Blues Party produced the 1987 debut album Where Y'at? and 1991's Mr. Good Thing, both showcasing his electric harmonica prowess. The pivotal moment came after attending the funeral of Zydeco pioneer Clifton Chenier, which inspired Sansone to take up the accordion—an instrument that would become central to his evolved sound. By the mid-1990s, particularly with the 1996 album Crescent City Moon on Rounder Records' Bullseye Blues label, Sansone had synthesized blues, boogie, and Louisiana Cajun and Zydeco influences into a distinctive swamp rock style that won multiple Offbeat magazine Best of the Beat Awards.

Following Hurricane Katrina's devastation, Sansone channeled his experiences into powerful songwriting, collaborating extensively with Anders Osborne and forming an acoustic trio with Osborne and guitarist John Fohl. His 2011 album The Lord Is Waiting and the Devil Is Too, which won Song of the Year at the 2012 Blues Music Awards, marked a creative peak and demonstrated his growth as a songwriter. To date, Sansone has released over fourteen original albums and maintains an active presence in New Orleans' music scene, having been a member of the Voice of the Wetlands Allstars since 2005 alongside artists like Tab Benoit, Cyril Neville, and George Porter Jr. His legacy encompasses a unique fusion of Chicago blues, Delta traditions, and Louisiana regional sounds, establishing him as a significant figure in contemporary American roots music.
