## Biography
Metallica, one of the most successful heavy metal bands in history, was formed on October 28, 1981, in Los Angeles, California, by vocalist/rhythm guitarist James Hetfield and drummer Lars Ulrich, who connected through Ulrich's ad in The Recycler newspaper seeking musicians influenced by New Wave of British Heavy Metal bands like Diamond Head and Iron Maiden. Hetfield, born in California, and Ulrich, born in Denmark and relocated to the U.S. at 17, initially recruited bassist Ron McGovney and lead guitarist Dave Mustaine. After releasing the influential demo No Life 'Til Leather and moving to the San Francisco Bay Area to enlist bassist Cliff Burton from Trauma, Mustaine was fired due to personal issues and replaced by Kirk Hammett from Exodus just before recording their debut album Kill 'Em All in 1983 on Megaforce Records, establishing their aggressive thrash metal sound characterized by fast tempos, complex instrumentation, and powerful riffs.[1][2][4]

The band's career skyrocketed with 1984's Ride the Lightning, produced by Flemming Rasmussen, featuring epics like 'For Whom the Bell Tolls' and 'Fade to Black,' leading to major label deals with Elektra. Their 1986 masterpiece Master of Puppets solidified their status as leaders of the 'Big Four' of thrash metal alongside Megadeth, Slayer, and Anthrax. Tragedy struck in 1986 when Cliff Burton died in a bus accident, prompting auditions that brought in bassist Jason Newsted. The self-titled Black Album (1991) brought mainstream success with hits like 'Enter Sandman,' selling over 16 million copies, while later works like the San Francisco Symphony collaboration S&M (1999) and 2023's 72 Seasons showcased their evolution, blending thrash roots with orchestral and experimental elements.[2][4]

Metallica's legacy endures as pioneers of thrash metal, with over 125 million albums sold worldwide, multiple Grammys including 10 for Best Metal Performance, and induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2009. Based in San Francisco for most of their career, they continue touring and releasing music, influencing generations with their relentless work ethic, musical innovation, and resilience through lineup changes and personal struggles.[2][4]
