## Biography
The Carrière Brothers, Joseph 'Bébé' Carrière (1908–2001) and Eraste 'Dolon' Carrière (1900–1983), were pioneering American Creole musicians from Lawtell, Louisiana, renowned for their mastery of traditional 'la la' music, a precursor to zydeco. Bébé began playing fiddle at age 13 or 14 using a homemade cigar box instrument before acquiring a proper fiddle, while Eraste learned diatonic button accordion from their father Ernest starting at age 15, preserving late 19th-century styles untouched by later Cajun influences. Born into a sharecropping family where music was a vital release after long days in the fields, the brothers performed at informal house parties and festive gatherings across southwest Louisiana, including as far as Lake Charles.[1][3][4][6][7]

In 1946, they formed the Lawtell Playboys, playing house dances that transitioned to club gigs at Slim's Y-Ki-Ki in Opelousas as venues evolved. They retired from most public performances in 1966, but their influence persisted through recordings like the 1977 Folkways release *La La: Louisiana Black French Music*, captured in their living room, which highlighted Afro-Caribbean polyrhythms, mazurkas, and Creole lyrics, bridging traditional Creole la-la to rural zydeco. Bébé incorporated hillbilly tunes like 'Kentucky Waltz,' while their style blended Creole, Cajun, and early zydeco elements.[3][4][6]

Their legacy endures as foundational figures who connected acoustic la-la traditions to electrified zydeco, teaching the next generation and earning recognition for conserving rare dances like shoe-fly, mazurkas, and contredanses. Bébé's death in 2001 marked the end of an era, but their home recordings and influence on subsequent bands like later iterations of the Lawtell Playboys continue to expose audiences to Creole music roots.[1][3][4][8]
