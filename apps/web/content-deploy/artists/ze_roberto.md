## Biography
José Roberto Bertrami, known as Zé Roberto, was born on February 21, 1946, in Tatuí, São Paulo state, Brazil, the eldest of seven children in a musical family where his father was a classical violinist and four siblings became musicians. Growing up immersed in music, he discovered jazz influences like Bill Evans and Miles Davis, alongside bossa nova, particularly admiring pianist Luiz Eça of the Tamba Trio. At age 13, he enrolled in a conservatory but was expelled after two years for breaking rules, such as holding jam sessions; by 19 in 1965, he recorded his debut album with Os Tatuís, featuring his composition 'A Bossa do Zé Roberto' alongside works by bossa nova masters like Antonio Carlos Jobim and Roberto Menescal, followed by the José Roberto Trio album in 1966 with his brother Claudio on double bass.[1][2][3][5][6][9]
