## Biography
The Spirit of the Fi Yi Yi is not a musical artist in the traditional sense, but rather a **Mardi Gras Indian tribe** based in New Orleans, Louisiana, led by **Big Chief Victor Harris**.[1] The tribe emerged in 1984 when Harris and Collins "Coach" Lewis were unexpectedly ousted from the Yellow Pocahontas tribe. Following a period of spiritual reflection and prayer, Harris experienced a transformative moment in which he adopted the name "Spirit of the Fi Yi Yi," describing it as a divine calling that gave him his "spiritual, cultural name."[1] The tribe became one of the most recognizable in New Orleans, known for their elaborate handmade suits adorned with intricate beadwork and their distinctive musical sound that blends African rhythms with New Orleans funk and jazz traditions.

The signature sound and aesthetic of the Spirit of the Fi Yi Yi were collectively developed by four key figures: Big Chief Victor Harris, master suit designer Jack Robertson, master drummer Wesley Phillips, and the late Collins "Coach" Lewis.[1] Phillips, who had studied African drumming in Washington D.C. and toured with the Sun Ra Arkestra, brought what he called the "9th Ward funk" to the group, creating songs like "Who Got the Fire" and the anthem "Fi Yi Yi (On Mardi Gras Day)."[1] The tribe's music and visual presentation draw heavily from African cultural traditions and Congo Square heritage, making them significant bearers of Black cultural traditions in New Orleans. Harris led the tribe for 41 years before retiring from masking on Mardi Gras Day 2024, passing leadership to his son, Victor Harris Jr.[1]

## Fun Facts
- Victor Harris experienced a spiritual awakening that led to the creation of the Spirit of the Fi Yi Yi after being ousted from the Yellow Pocahontas tribe. During a night of silent prayer and tears, Harris shouted "Fi-Yah-Yaaaaaaaaah!" with increasing intensity and conviction, after which he declared: "From that moment I became the spirit of Fi Yi Yi." He credits this moment as God speaking to him and giving him his spiritual, cultural name.[1]
- The creation of each Mardi Gras suit is an all-consuming endeavor. Harris's wife Christine supported the sewing process by keeping the sewing table fed during long work sessions. Harris was working on his 58th suit as of the 2024 Mardi Gras season, representing 41 years of continuous masking.[1]
- Wesley Phillips initially joined the Spirit of the Fi Yi Yi almost by accident. A friend from the Desire projects invited him to the Chief's house on Annette Street to play music with the Indians. Phillips grabbed one of his handmade drums (which he crafted by stretching animal hides over metal barrels) and headed over. When Harris finally emerged, Phillips ended up playing with him the entire day, and this spontaneous performance led to Phillips becoming a permanent member of the core team.[1]
- The Spirit of the Fi Yi Yi played a significant role in New Orleans funeral traditions and second line culture. The tribe participated in the funeral procession for Collins "Coach" Lewis, with Big Chief Victor Harris leading the Spirit of the Fi Yi Yi in a sinuous procession while the crowd called out "Coach!" in tribute to their fallen collaborator.[2]
