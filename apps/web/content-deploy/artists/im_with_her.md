## Biography
I'm With Her is an Americana supergroup formed in 2014 by three acclaimed singer-songwriters: Sarah Jarosz, Aoife O'Donovan, and Sara Watkins. The trio discovered their immediate musical chemistry during an impromptu jam at the Telluride Bluegrass Festival, leading to their decision to collaborate despite busy solo careers. Jarosz, a mandolin prodigy from Texas who met Watkins at age 9 and O'Donovan at 15, had already released multiple solo albums and won Grammys; O'Donovan, known for her work with Crooked Still and Sometymes Why, brought guitar and vocal prowess; Watkins, a fiddle player and co-founder of Nickel Creek, added her bluegrass roots. Their mutual admiration, rooted in years of running in similar folk circles, formed the basis of the band, named to emphasize enduring respect among them.[1][2][3]
