## Biography
Ambrose Campbell, born Oladipupo Adekoya Campbell on August 19, 1919, in Lagos, Nigeria, grew up in a Christian family where his father was a preacher. He sang in the church choir but rebelled by performing palm-wine music, earning the nickname 'Rosi' to hide it from his family, who eventually evicted him. Under the protection of nationalist Herbert Macaulay, he worked as a printer and joined the Jolly Boys Orchestra with guitarist Brewster Hughes before moving to London via the Merchant Navy during World War II.[1][2][4]

In 1946, Campbell and Hughes formed the West African Rhythm Brothers, Britain's first black band, debuting publicly at VE Day celebrations in Piccadilly Circus and Trafalgar Square. The group provided music for Les Ballets Nègres, secured a residency at Soho's Abalabi club (later Club Afrique) from 1952, and blended palm-wine, jùjú, calypso, and mento styles while collaborating with British jazz musicians like Ronnie Scott. They recorded numerous singles for Melodisc in the 1950s-1960s amid experiences of racism in postwar Britain.[1][2][3][4]

Campbell toured Italy, released the 1968 album *Highlife Today*, then moved to the US in 1972, recording and touring with Leon Russell (as his 'spiritual adviser') and Willie Nelson on *One for the Road*. Acknowledged by Fela Kuti as 'the father of modern Nigerian music,' he influenced jùjú artists, settled in Nashville, returned to the UK in 2004, and died on June 22, 2006, in Plymouth.[1][2]
