## Biography
Pat Bianchi, born in Rochester, New York, into a musically prolific family, began playing organ by ear at age 6 on a small combo organ and received a Farfisa Compact Duo as a Christmas gift at age 7. His parents enrolled him in classical piano studies at The Eastman School of Music’s preparatory program, where he also received mentorship from Rochester jazz musicians. By age 11, he was performing professional gigs with dance bands, and in high school, he shifted focus to jazz piano while maintaining his organ passion, eventually adopting a Hammond M100. Graduating cum laude from Berklee College of Music, Bianchi honed his skills as house pianist at Denver's El Chapultepec club, backing legends like Red Holloway and Conte Candoli, before committing fully to organ with his debut on 3osity's albums.

Relocating to New York City, Bianchi joined Lou Donaldson's quartet in 2009 and Pat Martino’s trio in 2011, serving as musical director for the latter over eight years. He recorded his leader debut *East Coast Roots* (featuring Mark Whitfield and Byron Landham) and collaborated on projects like The Unity Project with Ralph Peterson Jr., tributing Larry Young. A Grammy nominee, DownBeat 2016 Rising Star poll winner, Hot House 2019 poll winner, and 2024 Jazz Journalists Association Keyboardist nominee, Bianchi blends tradition with innovation on the Hammond B3, drawing from diverse influences. He has released nine albums as leader, appeared on over 35 as sideman, toured Europe and the US, opened for Steely Dan, and teaches jazz organ at Berklee, authoring its Hammond program curriculum while hosting 'Organized' on Sirius XM.[1][2][3][5]
