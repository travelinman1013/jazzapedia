## Biography
Duke Ellington (1899-1974) was a pioneering jazz composer and bandleader who fundamentally shaped American music through his innovative compositions and arrangements. Beginning his career in the 1920s, Ellington became one of the most successful and influential figures in jazz history, known for his sophisticated harmonic language and extended compositional works. His belief in universal humanism profoundly influenced his artistic direction, particularly in his later years when he devoted himself almost exclusively to sacred concerts and compositions.

Mahalia Jackson (1911-1972) was hailed as "The Queen of Gospel" and became the most powerful and influential gospel singer of the 20th century. Her breakthrough album "Move On Up a Little Higher" (1947) sold 8 million copies—an unprecedented achievement for gospel music at the time. Jackson was renowned for her powerful contralto voice and her refusal to compromise her artistic integrity by performing secular music, making her collaboration with Duke Ellington in 1958 a groundbreaking moment in American music history. She was also a close friend and colleague of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., performing at the 1963 March on Washington and serving as a vital figure in the Civil Rights Movement.
