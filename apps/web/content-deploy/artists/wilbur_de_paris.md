## Biography
Wilbur de Paris (January 11, 1900 – January 3, 1973) was born in Crawfordsville, Indiana, and first encountered jazz around age 16 in 1917 while performing in a summer show at the Lyric Theatre. He began his professional career playing C-melody saxophone, meeting Louis Armstrong at Tom Anderson's Cafe and working with A.J. Piron's band in 1922 before permanently switching to trombone. After high school, he worked briefly for his father, then toured with traveling shows, starting in Philadelphia in the early 1920s, and made his recording debut in 1928 with Leroy Smith, followed by sessions with Clarence Williams and Edith Wilson in 1929.[1][2][3]
