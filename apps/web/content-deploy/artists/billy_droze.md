## Biography
Billy Ryan Droze was born in 1986 in Lafayette, Louisiana, as the 10th of 12 children in a highly musical family, later growing up in Alabama. His father, Bob Droze, a seasoned country, gospel, and bluegrass musician still active into his 80s, profoundly shaped his early life; by age four, Billy was performing onstage with him at churches, honky-tonks, and bluegrass festivals. Self-taught on guitar starting at age 12, he honed his skills as a teenager by walking country roads to play for anyone who would listen, fueling his passion for traditional country, gospel, roots, bluegrass, and Americana music.[1][3]

At 16, Billy followed his father to Texas, joining his band for about a year before moving to Nashville, where he has resided since. There, he gigged relentlessly, signed briefly as an artist with RCA/Sony BMG (though it didn't fully materialize), and became a prolific songwriter with cuts like 'You Never Know' for Darryl Worley, 'I Know Better' for The Grascals, and 'Sunday Clothes' for Randy Kohrs. A major breakthrough came touring as lead singer Billy Ryan with Grammy-winning country band Shenandoah, boosting his profile across country, Americana, and bluegrass scenes.[1][2][3]

Droze's solo career exploded with bluegrass albums like the legendary debut 'To Whom It May Concern,' featuring five #1 singles, and 'Ready For The Ride,' which spawned three #1s on European Hot Disc charts during a 13-city Eastern Europe tour prompted by a family tragedy. Blending bluegrass traditions with modern Nashville energy, his heartfelt lyrics, earthy voice, and guitar style have earned accolades including 2019 ICMA Inspirational Bluegrass Artist of the Year, 2018 Grammy consideration, and IBMA/ICMA nods. As president of RBR Entertainment, he shapes bluegrass's future while hosting events like the 2018 ICMA Awards with Rhonda Vincent.[1][2]
