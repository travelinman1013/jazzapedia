## Biography
Grupo Batuque is a samba collective formed in Rio de Janeiro in 1996 by Joe Davis of Far Out Recordings, bringing together veteran Brazilian percussionists, drummers, and musicians during the height of Carnival. The group originated from three days of studio sessions with top percussionists and artists from local favela-based samba schools, resulting in their debut album 'Samba de Rua,' which captured the raw energy of rural street batucadas and Carnival atmosphere.[1][7] This project evolved into one of Far Out Recordings' most successful endeavors, blending traditional samba rhythms with funk, rock, and electronic elements across multiple releases.

The collective's career progressed with albums like 'Samba de Futebol' (a homage to Flamengo football club featuring members of Império Serrano led by Wilson das Neves), the Grammy-nominated 'Africa Brazil' (produced by Joe Davis and arranged by Ivan Conti, exploring samba's African roots), 'Rhythmix' (remixes by artists including 4 Hero and Masters At Work), and 'O Tempo Do Samba' (written by Ivan Conti, produced by Roc Hunter, with contributions from Cidinho Moreira and others).[1][3] Their musical style centers on percussive samba batucadas, infused with influences from capoeira, Candomblé, and broader Afro-Brazilian traditions, emphasizing up-tempo rhythms, horns, and vocals that appeal to both traditional sambistas and global audiences.[1][3]

Grupo Batuque's legacy lies in revitalizing samba's street and African origins through studio innovation, achieving international recognition via Far Out Recordings and Grammy nods, while showcasing intergenerational talent from Rio's samba schools and beyond.[1]
