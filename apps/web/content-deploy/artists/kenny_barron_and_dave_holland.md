## Biography
Kenny Barron & Dave Holland represent a masterful collaboration between two of jazz's most accomplished musicians. Kenny Barron, born in Philadelphia in 1943, began his professional career as a teenager with Mel Melvin's orchestra and drummer Philly Joe Jones before moving to New York City at age 19. He was hired by James Moody after being heard at the Five Spot, and subsequently joined Dizzy Gillespie's band in 1962 without Gillespie even hearing him play first—a testament to Moody's recommendation and Barron's reputation. Throughout his career, Barron became known as one of the most dependable sidemen in post-bop mainstream modern jazz, collaborating with legends including Stan Getz, Ron Carter, and serving as a long-standing professor at Rutgers University from 1974 to 2000.

Dave Holland, a bassist and composer, was discovered by Miles Davis at age 19 while performing at Ronnie Scott's jazz club in London's Soho district. Davis invited Holland to join his groundbreaking semi-electric band, where he contributed to landmark fusion albums including Filles De Kilimanjaro, In A Silent Way, and Bitches Brew. After relocating to upstate New York in 1972, Holland began his prolific recording career with the ECM label and co-founded the Gateway Trio with John Abercrombie and Jack DeJohnette. Over more than 50 years, Holland earned multiple Grammy Awards and was named an NEA Jazz Master in 2017.

The duo's partnership began in 2014 with their album The Art of Conversation, released on the Blue Note label, following what the search results describe as a 'successful musical meeting of the minds.' This collaboration was so successful that they reunited in 2020 for Without Deception on Impulse Records, which was noted as one of the top releases of that year. Their duet format allows both musicians to showcase their improvisational mastery and compositional depth, with Barron's piano work complementing Holland's innovative bass playing in intimate, conversational exchanges.
