## Biography
Earl Silas Johnson IV, known professionally as Earl King, was born on February 7, 1934, in New Orleans, Louisiana, into a musical family as the seventh son of a blues pianist who played with Tuts Washington. He began playing guitar at age 15, entering talent contests at local clubs like the Dew Drop Inn, where he met his idol Guitar Slim, whose flashy style profoundly shaped King's early development. In 1954, following Guitar Slim's accident, King deputized for him on tour, impersonating Slim and gaining prominence in the New Orleans R&B scene. His first recordings came in 1953 as Earl Johnson for Savoy Records, followed by sides for Specialty and a breakthrough hit in 1955 with 'Those Lonely, Lonely Nights' on Ace Records, reaching #7 on the Billboard R&B chart.[1][2][3][4]

King's career evolved through the 1960s with recordings for Imperial Records under Dave Bartholomew, yielding signature tracks like 'Come On' (later covered by Jimi Hendrix and Stevie Ray Vaughan) and 'Trick Bag,' alongside songwriting for artists such as Professor Longhair ('Big Chief'), Fats Domino, and Lee Dorsey. He briefly auditioned for Motown, toured with Sam Cooke, and launched his own Hot Line label, but faced setbacks with its collapse. A career resurgence came in the 1970s via live performances with the Radiators and in the 1980s with Black Top Records, starting with the 1986 Grammy-nominated album *Glazed* backed by Roomful of Blues. His style blended New Orleans R&B, blues, and rhythmic guitar work, cementing his legacy as a key figure in the city's music history until his death on April 17, 2003.[1][2][3][5]

King's songwriting prowess and guitar innovation influenced generations, with his compositions becoming blues standards and his later albums like *Sexual Telepathy* (1990) and *Hard River to Cross* (1993) showcasing collaborations with top New Orleans talent, revitalizing his touring career into his 50s and 60s.

## Fun Facts
- King impersonated his idol Guitar Slim on tour in 1954 after Slim's car accident, fooling promoters despite not looking like a guitarist, as Slim had a massive #1 R&B hit at the time.
- He opened shows for Sam Cooke in 1960 by performing his unrecorded song 'Come On' nightly, prompting Dave Bartholomew to record it upon his return to New Orleans.
- Originally named Earl Silas Johnson IV, he became 'Earl King' due to a typesetter's error at Specialty Records, which intended 'King Earl.'
- In the 1970s, a young rock band called the Rhapsodizers (later the Radiators) convinced the semi-retired King to join them onstage at Tipitina's, sparking his comeback.
