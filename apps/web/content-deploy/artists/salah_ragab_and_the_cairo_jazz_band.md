## Biography
Salah Ragab (1935-2008), born into a military family in Cairo, Egypt, enrolled in Egypt's Military Academy and began serving in the army in 1957, eventually rising to the rank of major and later becoming chief of the Egyptian Military Music Department, overseeing around 3,000 musicians. Fascinated by jazz despite his daytime duties playing marches, he studied jazz theory and improvisation with American saxophonist Osman Kareem from Kansas City, forming Cairo's first jazz quintet in 1963, which recorded for Cairo's Radio Service. After Kareem's departure in 1967, Ragab, with help from German musician Hartmut Geerken and Czech bassist Eduard 'Edu' Vizvari, handpicked top musicians from the military ranks to form Egypt's first jazz big band, The Cairo Jazz Band, in 1968, rehearsing in a designated 'Jazz House' in Heliopolis barracks.[1][2][3][5][6][7]

The band debuted in February 1969 at Ewart Memorial Hall at the American University in Cairo, performing originals by Ragab, Geerken, and Vizvari alongside standards by Dizzy Gillespie and Count Basie, followed by concerts at the Cairo Opera House, Alexandria University, and Egyptian TV. Blending American big band swing with Middle Eastern elements like ney and baz instruments, their sound was innovative; however, the 1973 Arab-Israeli War halted activities, leading Ragab to retire from the army to focus on music, opening a music shop and continuing to gig. In 1984, he toured with Sun Ra across Egypt, Greece, France, and Spain, later releasing the acclaimed 'Sun Ra meets Salah Ragab in Egypt' LP. Ragab also authored the only Arabic book on jazz, 'Jazz Music: The Roots and Future,' and gave educational lectures at the Goethe Institute.[1][2][3][5][6]

Ragab's legacy endures as a pioneer of Egyptian jazz, introducing big band swing to the region and bridging military music with improvisational jazz, influencing the local scene through his teachings and recordings that remain fresh and sought-after today.[3][4][6]
