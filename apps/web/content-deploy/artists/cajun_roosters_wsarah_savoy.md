## Biography
Sarah Savoy was born and raised in rural Savoy, Louisiana, into one of the most prominent families in Cajun music. Her parents, Marc Savoy, a renowned Cajun accordion maker and performer, and Ann Savoy, author of the seminal book 'Cajun Music, A Reflection of a People' (often called the Bible of Cajun music), immersed her in the tradition from childhood. She began playing music alongside her brother Wilson, attending Cajun jam sessions at the Blue Moon and dancing at venues like La Poussiere and Mulate's, where she occasionally performed with artists like Jason Frey. After a rebellious punk rock phase and a stint as a business executive, including time living in Russia, Savoy rediscovered her roots through Cajun music for solace, picking up the accordion her father made for her while previously favoring guitar.[1][2][4][6]

Savoy's career took a pivotal turn when she moved to France, forming Sarah Savoy & the Francadians with French musicians David Rolland, Vincent Blin, and Manolo Gonzales. Based in Paris (and later a trailer camp outside Versailles), the band blends traditional Cajun covers of pioneers like Amédée Ardoin, Joe and Cleoma Falcon, Iry LeJeune, with modern influences such as her cousin Steve Riley, Jason Frey, and her parents' repertoire. Her original songs, co-written with Gerard Dole, introduce a fresh voice celebrating the strong, independent modern woman, diverging from traditional themes of abandonment. Known for her sassy blues, honky-tonk growls, and forlorn waltzes, she also incorporates country and rockabilly, earning nicknames like 'The Queen of White Trash Cajun' and 'The Princess of Cajun.'[1][2][3][8]

Beyond music, Savoy became a cultural ambassador, teaching Cajun dancing, holding conferences on Cajun history, and gaining cult status for cooking demos of gumbo, jambalaya, and pecan pies. She self-published an updated edition of her mother's book and released the award-winning cookbook 'The Savoy Family Kitchen: A Family History of Cajun Food' in 2013. Memorable performances include Peter Gabriel's WOMAD festival, opening for Beausoleil at London's Meltdown Festival, and a wild Country-Cajun-Rockabilly cruise from Stockholm.[1][2][4]
