## Biography
Jenny Scheinman, born in San Francisco and raised in a remote homestead community on California's Lost Coast near Eureka in Humboldt County, grew up immersed in folk music within an off-the-grid family environment alongside her three siblings. She began studying piano and violin as a Suzuki student, traveling two hours to lessons in the nearest town, initially focusing more ambitiously on piano until college. After moving to the Bay Area, she honed her fiddling skills in various working bands before relocating to New York in her twenties to join the jazz scene, following friends who formed groups including early Norah Jones projects.[1][2][6][9]

Scheinman's career breakthrough came early in New York when Bill Frisell invited her for a 14-show run at the Village Vanguard, blending jazz with her roots in fiddle tunes and country songs like Hank Williams alongside Sonny Rollins influences. She became a versatile jazz violinist, releasing critically acclaimed solo albums such as *12 Songs* (named a Top Ten Album of 2005 by *The New York Times*), her rootsy vocal debut *Jenny Scheinman*, and instrumental works like *Crossing The Field* and the 2024 double album *All Species Parade*. A fiddler, violinist, singer, and songwriter, she has contributed to Grammy-winning recordings, made her Carnegie Hall debut as a leader, and balanced ensemble work with leadership in projects like her band Mischief & Mayhem.[1][2][3][5][6]

Returning to Humboldt County in 2012 to raise her family, including giving birth to her second child there, Scheinman has continued evolving her sound, merging jazz, Americana, folk, blues, and nature-inspired compositions reflective of her rural roots. Her plainspoken, theme-resolving style draws from jazz, blues, and folk traditions, earning her collaborations across genres while maintaining a presence in New York's creative music scenes.[2][4][5][7]
