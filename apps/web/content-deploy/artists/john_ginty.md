## Biography
John Ginty, born in 1972 in Morristown, New Jersey, began his musical journey as a drummer in jazz and marching bands before transitioning to keyboards in high school around 1990. He joined the local cover band Rose Hill after spotting an ad, where he honed his skills on the Hammond B-3 organ playing Allman Brothers, Derek and the Dominos, and Grateful Dead material at venues like Wetlands in New York City. This early experience marked his shift to professional music, leading to collaborations with Neal Casal, where he became a key sidekick on all of Casal's solo albums and toured extensively.[1][3][5][6][7]

Ginty's career exploded as a versatile session keyboardist and organist, working across genres including blues, rock, country, and hip-hop with artists like Robert Randolph and the Family Band (a founding member), The Chicks (formerly Dixie Chicks), Jewel, Wu-Tang Clan, Santana, Citizen Cope, Whiskeytown, Gov't Mule, and The Allman Brothers at Beacon Theatre. Since 2019, he has toured with the Allman Betts Band and serves as music director for the Allman Family Revivals honoring Gregg Allman. A two-time Grammy winner for his keyboards on The Blind Boys of Alabama's 'Higher Ground,' Ginty has released solo albums like 'Bad News Travels' on American Showplace Music, emphasizing his blues-rock roots with live, spontaneous sessions featuring guests like Warren Haynes and Albert Castiglia. He operates Shark Tank Studio for remote recordings.[1][2][4][5][7]

Primarily a blues and rock player, Ginty's self-taught, flamboyant style on the Hammond B-3—his 'true musical love' since high school—defines his legacy as a flexible session ace who brings fresh energy to diverse projects. With five solo records and credits on hundreds of albums (over 30 with producer Jim Scott), he continues performing with the John Ginty Band and high-profile acts, embodying the spontaneous spirit of live blues-rock.[2][4][5]
