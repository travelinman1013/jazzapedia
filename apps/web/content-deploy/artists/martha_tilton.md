## Biography
Martha Tilton (November 14, 1915 – December 8, 2006) was an American popular singer who became one of the defining vocalists of the swing era and traditional pop period. Born in Corpus Christi, Texas, Tilton discovered her natural singing talent early, performing on a small Los Angeles radio station while attending Fairfax High School. An agent who heard her on air signed her and booked her on larger stations, leading her to drop out of school in the 11th grade to join Hal Grayson's band, with whom she toured the West Coast for nearly three years. She subsequently performed with the quartet Three Hits and a Miss before joining the chorus on Benny Goodman's radio show, Camel Caravan, in 1937.

Tilton's career reached its zenith during her tenure with Benny Goodman's orchestra from August 1937 to April 1939. She was present at the historic January 16, 1938 Carnegie Hall concert, where Goodman's band performed the first-ever jazz concert at the venue, and she received the longest ovation of the evening for her rendition of "Loch Lomond." Most memorably, she recorded "And the Angels Sing" with Goodman in 1939, which became a No. 1 hit and remains her signature recording. During her time with Goodman, Tilton made over 80 recordings, establishing herself as one of the great swing vocalists despite receiving limited individual recognition as a band vocalist.

Following her departure from Goodman's orchestra in 1939, Tilton pursued a successful solo career throughout the 1940s and beyond. Her biggest solo hits included "I'll Walk Alone" (No. 4, 1944), "I Should Care" and "A Stranger in Town" (both No. 10, 1945), and "How Are Things in Glocca Morra" (No. 8, 1947). Nicknamed "The Liltin' Miss Tilton" for her clear, charming vocal style, she appeared on radio programs including Fibber McGee and Molly and Campana Serenade, acted in several films, and hosted a daily half-hour television show with Curt Massey that ran nearly seven years in Los Angeles. Over her lengthy career spanning from the 1930s through the 1990s, Tilton recorded over 350 songs and remained active in music until the mid-1960s, leaving a lasting legacy as a skilled interpreter of popular standards.
