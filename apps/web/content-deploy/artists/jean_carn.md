## Biography
Jean Carn, born Sarah Jean Perkins on March 15, 1947, in Columbus, Georgia, and raised in Atlanta, is an American R&B/soul and jazz singer renowned for her five-octave vocal range and sophisticated interpretative skills.[1][3] Her exceptional talent emerged early—by age four, she was singing solo with her church choir, and her parents encouraged her musical development across multiple instruments including piano, organ, clarinet, English horn, oboe, and bassoon.[2] After attending Booker T. Washington High School in Atlanta and earning a scholarship to Morris Brown College, where she studied Russian and performed across musical theater and grand opera, Carn met and married jazz pianist Doug Carn, abandoning her plans to attend Juilliard.[2]

Carn's professional career began in the early 1970s with her husband on the Black Jazz label, where the couple recorded three albums—"Infant Eyes," "Spirit Of The New Land," and "Revelation"—establishing a trend-setting jazz-fusion sound.[2][3] Her work caught the attention of Earth, Wind & Fire leader Maurice White, and she appeared on the group's first two recordings.[2] In 1976, she signed to Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff's Philadelphia International Records, releasing her debut solo album "Jean Carn" in 1977, which merged 1970s soul and jazz with sophisticated songwriting; her debut single "Free Love" became an international dance anthem.[2][3] After moving to Motown Records in 1982 with the album "Trust Me," Carn achieved her breakthrough with Omni Records in 1986, when "Closer Than Close"—produced by and featuring saxophonist Grover Washington Jr.—reached number one on the R&B charts, a success she attributed to adding an "e" to her surname on the advice of numerologist Lloyd Strayhorn in 1987.[2][3]

Beyond her solo career, Carn has been a vital force in American music as a backing vocalist, vocal coach, and collaborator with some of the industry's most prolific artists.[1][3] She has worked extensively with The Temptations, Norman Connors, Phyllis Hyman, Glenn Jones, and served as vocal coach to Mary Wilson of The Supremes and Michael Jackson.[2][3] Her legacy spans decades of jazz, gospel, and R&B, and she continues to perform and record, having released albums including "You're a Part of Me" (1988) and "Collaborations" (2003).[3]
