## Biography
Bill Evans, born William John Evans on August 16, 1929, in Plainfield, New Jersey, began his musical journey early, influenced by classical music and jazz. He studied piano performance and music education, graduating from Southeastern Louisiana University before moving to New York City in 1950. Evans gained prominence through collaborations, including with Miles Davis's sextet in 1958 and the landmark album *Kind of Blue* in 1959. Exhausted from the Davis band, he left to form his own trio by late 1959 with bassist Scott LaFaro and drummer Paul Motian, revolutionizing jazz trio dynamics through interactive, egalitarian interplay where all members shared melodic responsibilities.[1][2][3]

This seminal trio recorded influential albums like *Portrait in Jazz* (1959), *Explorations* (1961), *Sunday at the Village Vanguard* (1961), and *Waltz for Debby* (1961), emphasizing harmonic innovation, lyrical phrasing, and contrapuntal textures. LaFaro's death in a 1961 car accident ended the group, but its legacy endured. Evans continued leading trios, notably with bassist Eddie Gomez (1966–1978), producing works like *At the Montreux Jazz Festival* (1968), while battling heroin addiction that impacted his health. He recorded over 50 albums as leader, earning five Grammy Awards, and died on September 15, 1980.[1][3][5]

Evans's style featured impressionistic harmonies, subtle touch, use of space, and emotional depth, transforming the piano trio into a conversational ensemble. His work influenced modern jazz, prioritizing empathy and polyphony over traditional rhythm sections.[2][6][7]

## Fun Facts
- Evans's first album as leader, *New Jazz Conceptions* (1956), featured Paul Motian on drums and Teddy Kotick on bass, establishing his trio preference early.
- The trio's 1961 Village Vanguard recordings were made just weeks before Scott LaFaro's tragic death in a highway accident.
- Unauthorized bootleg recordings from 1960 Birdland radio broadcasts were released in the 1970s, infuriating Evans during his lifetime.
- Evans performed a standout solo on George Russell's 'All About Rosie' at a 1957 Brandeis University concert, announcing his arrival as a major talent.
