## Biography
Max Roach (January 10, 1924 – August 16, 2007) and Abbey Lincoln (born Aminata Moseka, August 6, 1930 – August 14, 2010) were pioneering jazz figures whose careers intertwined through marriage and collaboration from 1962 to 1970. Roach, born in Newland, North Carolina, and raised in Brooklyn, New York, emerged as a bebop drumming innovator in the 1940s, performing with Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie on landmark sessions like the 1945 Savoy recordings. Lincoln, born in Chicago and raised in rural Michigan, began as a vocalist in the 1950s, initially styled as a 'black Marilyn Monroe,' recording her debut with Benny Carter in 1956 before shifting toward jazz and activism.[1][4][3]

Their partnership defined hard bop and political jazz, highlighted by the 1960 album *We Insist! Freedom Now Suite*, a civil rights protest work with Lincoln's vocals and Roach's compositions addressing the Emancipation Proclamation centennial. Roach co-founded Debut Records with Charles Mingus in 1952, releasing *Jazz at Massey Hall*, and formed quintets with Clifford Brown and Sonny Rollins, exemplifying hard bop. Lincoln evolved from pop-influenced singing to raw, activist expression influenced by Billie Holiday, collaborating with Roach on Riverside albums and protesting events like Patrice Lumumba's murder at the UN in 1961. Roach later explored percussion ensembles like M'Boom and drum solos in *Drums Unlimited* (1966), while Lincoln continued solo work emphasizing civil rights and natural Black beauty.[1][4][3][2]

Roach's legacy as a bebop pioneer and composer influenced generations of drummers, earning DownBeat Hall of Fame induction in 1980; he taught at University of Massachusetts Amherst from 1972. Lincoln's activist songwriting and vocal style impacted jazz vocalists, remembered for sparking discussions on natural hair via her 'Naturally '62' show. Together, they bridged jazz with social justice, shaping genres like hard bop, bebop, and cool jazz.[1][4][2]
