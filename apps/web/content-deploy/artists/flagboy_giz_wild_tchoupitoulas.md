## Biography
Aaron 'Flagboy Giz' Hartley, a fifth-generation New Orleanian born and raised in the Ninth Ward, began his creative journey in high school by making beats. While studying at the University of New Orleans, where he graduated in 2011 and was named Homecoming King, he co-founded the 2-Cent Entertainment Collective with visual artist Brandan 'Bmike' Odums, producing parody videos and developing media skills, especially after Hurricane Katrina when he appeared on MTV's True Life episode 'I'm Returning to the Gulf Coast' in 2006.[1][3][5][6]

Giz joined the historic Wild Tchoupitoulas Mardi Gras Indian tribe in 2015 after first walking with them on Super Sunday in 2013, approaching Chief Rodrick Sylvas to become the Flagboy, a key role positioned between the Spyboy and Chief to represent the tribe and guard the procession.[1][2][3][5] His involvement deepened his mastery of beadwork, suit-making, and street performances during Mardi Gras and Super Sunday, where the tribe marches long routes from Tchoup 45 bar. Transitioning to music, he released his debut album Flagboy of the Nation in 2021, fusing traditional Mardi Gras Indian chants with hip-hop, West African rhythms, funk, brass band, and bounce, followed by I Got Indian in My Family in 2022 featuring Mannie Fresh.[4][5][7]

Flagboy Giz's style embodies Black New Orleans culture as a rapper, producer, instrumentalist, beadworker, and advocate, innovating Indian traditions through music and media while carrying forward the Wild Tchoupitoulas legacy from the 1970s with The Meters and Neville Brothers. His work, showcased at Art Basel via 2-Cent Collective, preserves and evolves Mardi Gras Indian practices amid rivalries and neighborhood pride.[3][5]
