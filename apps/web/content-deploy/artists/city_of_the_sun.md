## Biography
City of the Sun is an American acoustic post-rock band formed in 2011 on the Upper East Side of New York City by guitarist John Pita, born in Los Angeles and raised in Ecuador, and vocalist Troubadour Adam Road, who departed in 2014. Guitarist Avi Snow joined in 2012, and drummer/percussionist Zach Para came aboard in 2013, solidifying their core sound while busking on New York streets and subways, which honed their instrumental style blending post-rock, gypsy jazz, flamenco, indie rock, American folk, and blues. Their street performances led to an invitation to the 2013 TED conference and subsequent TEDx events, marking their rapid rise.[1][3][4]

Signed to Chesky Records in 2015, they released their debut full-length album *to the sun and all the cities in between* in March 2016, recorded live in a single day at a Brooklyn church, debuting at No. 12 on the Billboard jazz charts despite not identifying strictly as jazz. Follow-up releases include the self-titled *City of the Sun* (2020) and *Segunda Alma* (2022), alongside numerous EPs like *Live at the Factory* (2014) and *Untitled* (2017), with singles such as 'Everything' reaching high on Spotify Viral charts. The band has toured extensively in Europe and built a global cult following through their cinematic, instrumental music.[1][2][4][5]

Currently operating as a duo of Pita and Para according to some sources, with past and occasional members like Snow, Matt Fasano (bass), and Marco Bolfelli (guitar), City of the Sun continues to evolve, drawing from influences like Dire Straits, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Santana, The War on Drugs, and Coldplay to create virtuosic, melodic instrumental works that evoke films and stories without words.[2][3][5]

## Fun Facts
- The band developed their signature sound busking daily on New York City streets and subways starting in 2012, quitting day jobs to pursue music full-time.
- Their 2016 debut album was recorded live to tape in just nine hours (one day) at a Brooklyn church.
- A viral video of a Union Square performance helped them sell out shows in Europe, including Greece.
- Despite debuting at No. 12 on Billboard jazz charts, members taught themselves guitar without formal music school training and don't consider themselves a jazz band.
