## Biography
DJ Maphorisa, born Themba Sonnyboy Sekowe on November 15, 1987, in Soshanguve, South Africa, to a Nigerian father and South African mother, began his music journey in his teens. In grade 11, he used a family computer to produce his first song and started DJing at local events like weddings with a sound system bought by his family. At 17, he secured his first record deal and produced the album *Funny Face*, though it underperformed; he honed his skills, producing early hits like Professor's 'Jezebel' and DJ Zinhle's 'My Name Is' before signing with Kalawa Jazmee Records in 2010 at age 19.[1][2][5][6]

His career exploded with major productions such as 'Khona' for Mafikizolo in 2013, which won Song of the Year at the 2014 MTV Africa Music Awards, and Drake's global hit 'One Dance' in 2016, topping charts in 15 countries. A pioneer in amapiano—a blend of house, gqom, afropop, and deep house—he founded BlaqBoy Music (later idlozi Records) and collaborated on tracks like 'Midnight Starring' (2018) and 'Mnike' (2023). He earned awards including African DJ of the Year at the 2023 Soundcity MVP Awards and nominations at SA Amapiano Music Awards.[1][3][4][6]

DJ Maphorisa's legacy as the 'King of Amapiano' stems from his prolific output, mentorship of new talents, and fusions like the 2023 mixtape *The Konka Mixtape: Sweet And Dust* with Kabza De Small, solidifying his influence in South African and global electronic music scenes.[1][6]
