## Biography
Sweet Cecilia is a Grammy-nominated family trio from Cecilia, Louisiana, consisting of sisters Laura Huval (vocals, mandolin, acoustic guitar), Maegan Berard Rankin (vocals, bass, electric and acoustic guitars), and their first cousin Callie Guidry (vocals, drums, percussion). Formed formally in 2012, the group traces its roots to childhood, when they were encouraged to pursue music by their late father and uncle, Al 'Pyook' Berard, a Grammy-nominated Cajun musician known for incorporating guitar and fiddle into traditional Cajun music. Growing up in a musical family in the small Creole-speaking village of Cecilia, nestled between Bayou Teche and the Atchafalaya Basin, the women developed their signature rich, sultry three-part harmonies and skills as vocalists, multi-instrumentalists, and songwriters, blending country, rock, folk, and Cajun influences while keeping their traditions fresh and modern.[1][2][3]

Their career gained momentum with a self-titled debut album in 2015, named one of OffBeat Magazine's top 50 albums, followed by the 2017 sophomore release 'Sing Me A Story,' produced by six-time Grammy winner Tony Daigle, which won OffBeat's 'Best of the Beat Awards' for Best Country/Folk/Singer-Songwriter Artist and Album, and ranked in the magazine's Top 50 Albums of 2017. They also earned a 2018 'Times of Acadiana' Best Award for top local country groups and a Grammy nomination for their 2020 tribute album 'A Tribute to Al Berard,' honoring their father's legacy with reimagined classics recorded in their family home studio. Sweet Cecilia has performed at major Louisiana festivals including Festival International de Louisiane, Breaux Bridge Crawfish Festival, French Quarter Festival, and New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, establishing themselves in the Americana and Regional Roots scene.[1][3][4]

Beyond music, the trio contributes to their community: Laura founded Joyful Noise Ministries, blending faith and music for healing; Callie teaches Cajun music and other genres to high school students; and they direct proceeds from the tribute album to the Al Berard Memorial Music Fund for local youth musicians in St. Martin Parish. Their work preserves Louisiana's cultural heritage, emphasizing community support and family legacy.[1][2]
