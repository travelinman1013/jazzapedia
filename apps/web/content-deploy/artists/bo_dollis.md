## Biography
Theodore Emile 'Bo' Dollis was born on January 14, 1944, in New Orleans, Louisiana, where he displayed an extraordinary singing talent from early childhood, performing in church and imitating artists like Fats Domino without formal training. Growing up in the Central City neighborhood, he secretly joined the Mardi Gras Indian tradition in high school, masking for the first time at age 13 with the Golden Arrows in 1957 despite his parents' concerns over potential violence between tribes. By 1964, he had risen to become Big Chief of the Wild Magnolias tribe, named after Magnolia Street, leading them for over 45 years while crafting elaborate, beadwork-intensive suits for Mardi Gras and St. Joseph's Day.[1][2]

Dollis revolutionized Mardi Gras Indian music by merging traditional chants and percussion with New Orleans funk, R&B, and brass elements, introducing new instrumentation and recording seminal works like the 1970 single 'Handa Wanda' produced by Quint Davis and albums such as *They Call Us Wild* and *The Wild Magnolias* (1974), backed by all-stars including Willie Tee and Snooks Eaglin. The Wild Magnolias performed at landmark events like the first New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival in 1970, Carnegie Hall, and the Smithsonian Folklife Festival, bringing the culture national and international acclaim. Despite health challenges from strokes and diabetes post-Hurricane Katrina, Dollis continued performing until his final show at Jazz Fest in 2013, passing the torch to his son Gerard 'Bo Jr.' Dollis before his death on January 20, 2015, at age 71.[1][2][5]

His legacy endures through the Wild Magnolias' dual styles of traditional parade music and funk/R&B concerts, compositions like 'Smoke My Peace Pipe' that charted on Billboard, and his role in opening Mardi Gras Indian traditions to wider audiences via commercial recordings and collaborations.

## Fun Facts

- In 1970, he led a second line down Canal Street through the French Quarter to Congo Square, singing with other Indians and drawing crowds who followed along.[2]
- Post-Katrina strokes and diabetes left him unable to speak easily, but he could still sing powerfully and performed until 2013.[2]
- His 1970 'Handa Wanda' single became a jukebox hit and template for all subsequent Mardi Gras Indian recordings.[2]
