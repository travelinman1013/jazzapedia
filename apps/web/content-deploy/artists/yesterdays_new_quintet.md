## Biography
Yesterdays New Quintet is a jazz project conceived by hip-hop producer Otis Jackson Jr., professionally known as Madlib, in the summer of 2000.[1] The group was formed as a fictional quintet, with all five members—Joe McDuphrey, Malik Flavors, Ahmad Miller, Monk Hughes, and Otis Jackson Jr.—being pseudonyms created by Madlib himself.[4] Set up initially in the living room of Stones Throw Records' Los Angeles headquarters, the collective lived and worked there through the end of 2000 before relocating to Madlib's studio in a former Cold War-era bomb shelter.[1] The project emerged after Madlib took an extended break from hip-hop production, deciding to "replace the SP1200 with the Fender Rhodes" and explore jazz instrumentation.[3]

The group's debut album, *Angles Without Edges*, was released on September 11, 2001, and despite initial neglect, it received critical acclaim from those who engaged with it.[1][2] Following this, the collective released a full album of Stevie Wonder covers titled *Stevie* in 2003, featuring instrumental renditions of classics like "Superstition" and "Too High."[2] Madlib envisioned a Wu-Tang Clan-like trajectory for the project, with each founding member eventually branching off to release solo material and introduce new fictional members and groups.[1] This expansion led to the creation of "Yesterdays Universe," an umbrella collective that grew to include numerous spin-off projects and collaborators, many of whom appeared on Madlib's 2003 Blue Note remix album *Shades of Blue*.[1][3]

The original Yesterdays New Quintet lineup officially disbanded in 2007 with the release of the compilation *Yesterday's Universe*, which marked the transition into a new era.[2] Rather than a greatest-hits collection, this album introduced multiple new groups emerging from each of the five original members, including The Otis Jackson Jr. Trio, Young Jazz Rebels, Sound Directions, and The Electro-Acoustic Space Jazz & Percussion Ensemble.[2] Through sampling vintage jazz records and performing all instruments himself, Madlib created an innovative reinterpretation of jazz, blending it with hip-hop and electronic influences.[2] The project's legacy lies in its experimental approach to genre-blending and its influence on the broader Yesterdays Universe collective.
