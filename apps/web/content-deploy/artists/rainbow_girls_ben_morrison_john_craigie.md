## Biography
Rainbow Girls is a Northern Californian folk-rock trio consisting of Erin Chapin, Caitlin Gowdey, and Vanessa Wilbourn (also known as Vanessa May), formed in 2010 while the members attended the University of California at Santa Barbara. They originated from the North Bay area of California and began performing at an underground open mic night called “Bean Night” in Isla Vista, initially as a larger group of women musicians that evolved into a trio. The band gained significant exposure through their 2018 viral video cover of Alvin Robinson’s “Down Home Girl,” which led to professional management and booking, and they have released albums including the crowdfunded debut *The Sound of Light* (2013), *Perceptronium* (2015), *American Dream* (2017), and the cover album *Give the People What They Want* (2019).[3][7][8]

John Craigie, a road-tested American folk troubadour from Los Angeles, began writing songs at age 16 and developed his craft in Santa Cruz during college open mics around 2003, releasing his first solo album that year. Inspired by outsider folkies like Townes Van Zandt, Blaze Foley, John Prine, Van Morrison, Woody Guthrie, and Wilco, he embraced a modern troubadour life, touring extensively and recording in communal settings like a Portland Victorian house shared with fellow musicians. Albums such as *No Rain, No Rose* (2017), featuring Portland artists like The Shook Twins and Fruition members, reflect his sharp wit, storytelling, and blend of Americana homage and innovation.[1][4][5][6]

Ben Morrison, a guitarist and vocalist from the bluegrass/Americana band The Brothers Comatose, collaborates within the West Coast folk scene, notably contributing vocals to Rainbow Girls' cover of “A Hard Rain's Gonna Fall” alongside John Craigie on their 2019 album *Give the People What They Want*. These artists interconnect through shared performances and recordings in the vibrant Northern California and Portland music communities.[2][5][8]
