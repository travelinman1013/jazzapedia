## Biography
Tanya Tagaq, born Tanya Tagaq Gillis on May 5, 1975, in Cambridge Bay (Ikaluktutiak), Nunavut, Canada, is a groundbreaking Inuk throat singer, composer, author, visual artist, and activist. Growing up in the remote Arctic community, she did not initially engage in throat singing but discovered it at age 15 while attending Sir John Franklin High School in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, where she lived at Akaitcho Hall. She taught herself the traditional Inuit vocal practice from cassette tapes sent by her mother during her visual arts studies at the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design in Halifax, innovating a distinctive solo style since partners were unavailable.[1][3][5]

Tagaq's career launched with her 2005 debut album *Sinaa*, which earned multiple Canadian Aboriginal Music Awards and a Juno nomination, followed by collaborations with Björk on the 2004 album *Medúlla* and tours, bringing her international acclaim. Her 2014 album *Animism* won the Polaris Music Prize and a Juno Award, blending throat singing with punk, electronic, metal, folk, and classical elements in improvisational, visceral performances. Subsequent releases like *Retribution* (2016) and *Tongues* addressed themes of violence against women and environmental issues, while she composed for film, ballet, and the Kronos Quartet's *Fifty for the Future* project.[1][2][4][5]

A member of the Order of Canada with multiple honorary doctorates, Tagaq's legacy lies in redefining Inuit throat singing as a contemporary art form, pushing boundaries across genres and mediums, and advocating as a climate activist and voice for Indigenous issues, influencing pop, classical, and avant-garde music worlds.[4][5][7]
