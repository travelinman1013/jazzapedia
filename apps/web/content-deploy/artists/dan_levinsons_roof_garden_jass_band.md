## Biography
Dan Levinson, born Daniel A. Levinson on July 8, 1965, in Los Angeles County, California, began his musical journey in the early 1980s, specializing in the jazz styles of the 1910s, 1920s, and 1930s as a clarinetist, saxophonist, and bandleader. Originally from the Los Angeles area, he moved to New York City in 1983, where he met his key mentor, veteran reedman James 'Rosy' McHargue, who profoundly influenced his technique, intonation, and understanding of early jazz. Levinson also studied with clarinet instructor Leon Russianoff and saxophone virtuoso Al Gallodoro. His career started modestly, including street performances in Paris with a quartet led by Dick Miller featuring a young Madeleine Peyroux, followed by busking across 17 European countries and a stint in New Orleans at the Royal Sonesta Hotel.[1][2][3]

Settling firmly in New York by 1993, Levinson joined Vince Giordano's Nighthawks in 1992 as tenor saxophonist, becoming a 30-year member of the premier 1920s-'30s hot jazz orchestra, performing at Carnegie Hall and on national television. He toured extensively with Leon Redbone from 1990 to 2002, appeared with luminaries like Dick Hyman, Mel Tormé, and Wynton Marsalis, and led bands such as the Roof Garden Jass Band, evoking 1917-1923 New Orleans jazz, the Palomar Quartet modeled after Benny Goodman's, and Fête Manouche honoring Django Reinhardt. His global performances include Brazil with Woody Allen's Bunk Project, Europe with various ensembles, and Japan with the New York Ragtime Orchestra, alongside regular appearances at Lincoln Center and the Rainbow Room.[2][3][4][5]

Levinson's musical style is defined by meticulous recreation of early jazz traditions, earning him the title 'in-demand reedman' from The Mississippi Rag. Despite challenges like a throat cancer diagnosis, he continues as a prolific leader and sideman, co-founding James Langton’s New York All-Star Big Band and touring with Andrej Hermlin’s Swing Dance Orchestra, while accompanying vocalists including his wife, Molly Ryan. His legacy endures through preserving century-old jazz via the New Millennium All Stars and tribute concerts to Benny Goodman and others.[1][2][4][7]
