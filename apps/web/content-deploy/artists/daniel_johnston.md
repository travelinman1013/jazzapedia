## Biography
Daniel Dale Johnston (January 22, 1961 – c. September 11, 2019) was an American singer-songwriter, musician, and visual artist regarded as a significant figure in outsider and lo-fi music. Born in Sacramento, California, Johnston enrolled in the Art School program at Kent State University in Ohio while living with his parents in West Virginia, where he began writing and recording songs in 1980. His early recordings, including the cassette albums "Songs of Pain" (1981) and "Hi, How Are You?" (1983), were characterized by lo-fi production, childlike simplicity, and anguished vocals recorded on a $59 Sanyo mono boom box. These homemade tapes featured classics such as "Speeding Motorcycle" and "Sorry Entertainer," establishing his distinctive artistic voice despite their raw, unpolished quality.

In 1984, Johnston moved to Austin, Texas, where he became a fixture in the local music scene, handing out free tapes at performances and introducing himself as "A Manic Depressive with Grandiose Dreams." His breakthrough came in 1985 when he was featured on MTV's "The Cutting Edge," a program showcasing Austin's "new sincerity" music scene, which significantly expanded his visibility. His reputation grew substantially, leading to a bidding war between major labels Elektra and Atlantic Records in the early 1990s. Despite his rising prominence, Johnston signed with Atlantic Records and released his major-label debut "Fun" in 1994, produced by Paul Leary of Butthole Surfers. However, the album sold fewer than 6,000 copies and was dropped by the label in 1996, after which Johnston continued recording independently and touring internationally.

Throughout his career, Johnston struggled with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, which profoundly influenced his artistic output and personal life. His high, wobbly vocals, uneven tempos, and percussive piano playing earned him recognition as an "outsider artist," with his work championed by prominent musicians including Kurt Cobain of Nirvana and Jeff Tweedy of Wilco. Johnston's most enduring work came from the 1980s, much of it recorded in West Virginia. He released eighteen studio albums in total, with his final album issued in 2012. Later in life, medication-induced tremors prevented him from playing guitar or piano, yet he continued to create music and visual art until his death in 2019. His legacy extends beyond music into the visual arts, with his work featured in galleries globally.

## Fun Facts
- Johnston famously converted his brother's bench press into a recording area with an organ to create his first full-length album, demonstrating his resourcefulness and commitment to music despite limited resources.
- He joined a traveling carnival in Texas, working at a corn dog stand and later a hot dog stand at AstroWorld Amusement Park, experiences he described as being "like a movie all the time" that inspired his songwriting.
- Johnston refused to sign a multi-album deal with Elektra Records because he was convinced that Metallica, who were on the label's roster, were Satanic and would hurt him, showcasing his struggles with mental health during his career.
- He was not originally scheduled to appear on MTV's "The Cutting Edge" in 1985, but other bands insisted he be featured on the show, which became a pivotal moment in launching him to wider recognition.
