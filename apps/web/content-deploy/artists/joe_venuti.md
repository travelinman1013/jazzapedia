## Biography
Giuseppe "Joe" Venuti (September 16, 1903 – August 14, 1978) was an American jazz musician and pioneer jazz violinist, widely considered the father of jazz violin.[2] Born to Italian parents emigrating to the United States, Venuti claimed to have been born aboard a ship.[1][3] He grew up in Philadelphia, where he received classical violin training from an early age, studying solfeggio with his grandfather.[2] His solid classical foundation became evident in his distinctive playing style, characterized by excellent intonation, sharp bright tone, and virtuosic technique.[4]

Venuti's professional career began in 1924 when he joined Jean Goldkette's orchestra in Detroit, making his first recordings with the band.[2] However, his most significant impact came through his partnership with guitarist Eddie Lang, whom he met in 1913 at school in Philadelphia.[3][4] From 1926 to 1933, Venuti and Lang made numerous influential recordings as leaders and featured soloists, becoming internationally famous for their innovative violin and guitar duets.[2][3] Their groundbreaking work would later inspire European jazz musicians Django Reinhardt and Stéphane Grappelli.[3][5] Venuti's playing style was revolutionary—he pioneered techniques such as left-hand pizzicato, the "violin capo" technique using his first finger as a root position, and the "double shuffle" pattern that would later influence western swing and bluegrass fiddlers.[4] He favored fast tempos and rhythmic patterns of duplets and running sixteenth notes that showcased his extraordinary technical ability.[2]

Following Eddie Lang's death in 1933, Venuti's career experienced a significant decline.[5] He led a big band from 1935 to 1943 with modest success, then toured with small groups while struggling with alcoholism.[5] However, a celebrated performance at the Newport Jazz Festival in 1968 sparked his rediscovery, leading to a resurgence in the 1970s.[5] In his final years, Venuti recorded with notable jazz figures including tenor saxophonist Zoot Sims and pianist Earl Hines, with whom he recorded the album *Hot Sonatas* in 1976.[2] He died in Seattle, Washington, leaving behind a legacy as the pioneering figure who established the violin as a solo instrument in jazz.

## Fun Facts
- Venuti was a notorious practical joker who once hired dozens of bass players to meet him at a busy New York street corner simply to observe the chaos that ensued; the large number of musicians and their instruments blocked traffic.[5]
- He deliberately provided incorrect information about his background throughout his life, resulting in different listings of his birth year and country of origin in various sources, making it difficult for historians to verify basic biographical details.[5]
- Despite claiming to have studied at a conservatory, Venuti provided no corroborating details about his formal classical training, yet his playing style was characteristic of someone with a solid foundation in violin technique.[2]
- Venuti experienced a period of relative obscurity in the 1940s and 1950s, working at the Desert Inn Hotel in Las Vegas before being 'rediscovered' in the late 1960s, leading to a career resurgence in his final decade.[2]
