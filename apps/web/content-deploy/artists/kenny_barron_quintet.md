## Biography
Kenneth 'Kenny' Barron, born June 9, 1943, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, began playing piano at age 12 with encouragement from Ray Bryant's sister and started performing professionally as a teenager with Mel Melvin's orchestra alongside his brother, tenor saxophonist Bill Barron, and drummer Philly Joe Jones while still in high school[1][2][3][5][6]. At 19, he moved to New York City in 1961-1962, freelancing with Roy Haynes, Lee Morgan, and James Moody after Moody heard him at the Five Spot, leading to Dizzy Gillespie hiring him on Moody's recommendation without an audition[1][2][4][5][6][7]. Influenced by Yusef Lateef, Barron pursued education, earning a B.A. in Music from Empire State College while touring, and joined Rutgers University faculty in 1973 until 2000, mentoring emerging talents[1][2][5].

Barron's career spans over 40 albums as a leader since his 1974 debut 'Sunset to Dawn' on Muse, hundreds as sideman, and co-leading Sphere (1977-1988, revived 1998 with Gary Bartz) dedicated to Thelonious Monk's music, and the Classical Jazz Quartet (2001-2002)[1][2][5][6][7]. Key collaborations include Stan Getz in the 1980s on albums like 'Anniversary,' 'Serenity,' and Grammy-nominated 'People Time,' plus trios with Buster Williams and Ben Riley[5][6][7]. His mainstream jazz piano style blends bebop lyricism, elegant improvisation, and composition mastery, earning 14 Grammy nominations, six Jazz Journalists Association Best Pianist awards, 2005 American Jazz Hall of Fame induction, 2009 Living Legacy Award, and honorary doctorates from Berklee (2010) and others[1][2][5][6].

Recognized as one of the most influential post-bebop pianists, Barron performs solo, trio, or quintet worldwide, with recent works like Grammy-nominated 'Spirit Song' (2000) and 'Freefall' (2001) with Regina Carter, continuing his journeyman legacy in modern jazz[2][3].

## Fun Facts
- Dizzy Gillespie hired Barron in 1962 without hearing him play, solely on James Moody's recommendation after Moody caught his Five Spot performance[1][2][4][5][6][7].
- Barron composed and arranged for Yusef Lateef's 1960 album 'The Centaur and the Phoenix' as a teenager, before his recording debut as a pianist[3].
- He studied classical piano from ages 6 to 16, introduced to jazz via brother Bill's 78 records[9].
- Sphere, his Monk-dedicated quartet, took a 15-year hiatus after Charlie Rouse's death before reuniting with Gary Bartz in 1998[2][5][7].
