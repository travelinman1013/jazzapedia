## Biography
José Mercé, born José Soto Soto on April 19, 1955, in Jerez de la Frontera, Cádiz, Andalucía, Spain, grew up in a flamenco-rich family as the nephew of legendary cantaor Manuel Soto Sordera and great-grandson of seguiriya maestro Francisco Valencia (Paco la Luz). His nickname 'Mercé' originated from singing in the choir of the Basilica de la Merced as a boy. Starting young, he performed at flamenco festivals at age 12, sang at Jueves Flamencos in Jerez and tablao La Cueva del Pájaro Azul in Cádiz, and recorded his first album, Bandera de Andalucía, in 1968 at 13 after moving to Madrid, produced by Manuel Ríos Ruiz.[1][3][6]

Mercé became a sought-after singer for dancers, backing the Trío Madrid (Mario Maya, El Güito, Carmen Mora) and joining Antonio Gades' company from 1973 to 1983, touring worldwide and appearing in Carlos Saura's film Bodas de Sangre. He won the Concurso Nacional de Arte Flamenco de Córdoba in 1986, boosting his fame, and solidified his status with albums like Del Amanecer (1998, produced by Vicente Amigo) and Aire (2000, produced by Isidro Sanlúcar), blending traditional flamenco with pop elements. His style evolved into accessible 'open flamenco' fusion, attracting younger audiences while honoring roots, with 19 albums including recent hits like El Oripandó (2022).[1][2][3][5]

A staple at Andalucía summer festivals, Mercé has earned the Medalla de Andalucía (2010, 2019), Ondas Award (2000), Grammy Latino nomination for Mi Única Llave (2013), and Taranto de Oro (2016). He continues as a living flamenco legend, emphasizing traditional forms amid modern fusions.[2][3]
