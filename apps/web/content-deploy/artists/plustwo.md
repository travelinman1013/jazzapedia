## Biography
Plustwo was a short-lived Italian pop and Italo-disco duo formed in the early 1980s, consisting of two singing sisters, Marina Bianchi (aka Sue Sadlow) and Antonella Bianchi (aka Belen Thomas), who were multi-award-winning singers hailing from Italy. Emerging during the vibrant Italo-disco scene at the start of the decade, the group captured the era's synth-driven sound with catchy melodies and danceable rhythms. They recorded two EPs between 1983 and 1984, including releases on labels like Best Record and MIO Records (2), featuring tracks that blended cute, synth-pop elements with straight-up disco vibes.[1][2][3]

Their music was characterized by pitch-bend synth bass, keyboard stabs, and vocals reminiscent of Kate Bush, as heard in standout tracks like 'Melody' and 'Stop Fantasy.' 'Melody' offered a playful, catchy appeal with its electronic instrumentation, while 'Stop Fantasy' delivered upbeat disco energy perfect for club nights. Another notable release was the 1984 12-inch 'New Sensation' on MIO Records, solidifying their place in the Italo-disco genre alongside contemporaries in Italy's electronic music explosion.[1][3][4]

Though brief, Plustwo's output became prized among record collectors and experienced a resurgence in popularity, going viral on TikTok in recent years due to their 1983 vinyl club mixes. Their work exemplifies the innovative, synthesizer-heavy Italo-disco style that influenced global electronic dance music, leaving a niche but enduring legacy in the genre.[2][5]
