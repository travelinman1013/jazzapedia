## Biography
Charlie Haden, born on August 6, 1937, in Shenandoah, Iowa, began his musical journey at age two, singing with his family's country music band on Midwestern radio and television programs. A bout with polio at age 15 ended his singing career, leading him to study bass. After high school in Missouri, he moved to Los Angeles, where he played West Coast jazz with artists like Art Pepper and Paul Bley, and in 1957 encountered Ornette Coleman, joining his innovative quartet with Don Cherry and Billy Higgins, contributing to landmark albums like *The Shape of Jazz to Come* (1959).[1][2][3]

In 1969, amid political unrest, Haden formed the Liberation Music Orchestra (LMO), a revolutionary big band blending free jazz, bebop, Spanish Civil War folk songs, and protest music, with arrangements by Carla Bley; the debut album on Impulse! featured musicians like Don Cherry, Gato Barbieri, and Roswell Rudd. He reformed the LMO in 1982 (*The Ballad of the Fallen*) and later, maintaining it alongside his bebop Quartet West into the 2010s. Haden also co-founded Old and New Dreams with ex-Coleman sidemen in 1976 and taught at California Institute of the Arts from 1982 for three decades.[1][2][4][6]

Haden's style, influenced by bop bassist Wilbur Ware, emphasized swinging rhythms, a large centered tone, melodic soloing, and harmonic sensitivity, pioneering the bassist's role in free jazz improvisation. His political activism shone through LMO recordings tied to crises like Vietnam, El Salvador, and the Iraq War (*Not In Our Name*, 2005). Haden passed away in 2014, leaving a legacy as a composer, bandleader, and activist who bridged genres and elevated bass expression.[1][3][5]

## Fun Facts
- At 15, polio damaged Haden's vocal cords, ending his country singing career and pivoting him to bass.
- In 1971, during an Ornette Coleman tour in Portugal, Haden was arrested by secret police for dedicating 'Song for Che' to liberation movements in Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau, and Angola; he was released after U.S. intervention.
- LMO albums were released during Republican administrations, responding to events like Vietnam (1969), El Salvador (1982), and Iraq (2005).
- Haden bonded with Carla Bley over shared love of Shostakovich and Satie, inspiring LMO's protest fusion.
