## Biography
Slinger Francisco, better known as Mighty Sparrow, was born on July 9, 1935, in Grand Roy, Saint John, Grenada, and moved to Trinidad with his family at the age of one, where he grew up in Port of Spain.[1][2][3] Exposed to music through his Catholic school choir, he developed an interest in calypso at age 14 by joining a neighborhood steelband. Adopting the stage name 'Mighty Sparrow' for his small but commanding presence, he debuted in 1954 with 'The Parrot and the Monkey' and broke through in 1956 with the record-breaking hit 'Jean and Dinah (Yankees Gone),' which propelled him to international fame, including a cover by Harry Belafonte.[1][2][3][4]

Sparrow revolutionized calypso by blending folk roots with jazz and American pop elements, creating an international art form, and became prolific, recording over 70 albums and more than 500 songs across seven decades.[1][3] He dominated Trinidad's Carnival competitions, winning the Road March eight times (including a triple win in 1958 with 'P.A.Y.E.,' 'Russian Satellite,' and 'Theresa'), Calypso King/Monarch eight to eleven times, and Calypso King of Kings twice (1985 and 1988).[1][2][3][5] His career included global tours, UK and US releases in the 1960s, and later ventures like a 1993 Reggae Sunsplash appearance and 'Gospel-lypso' in the 2000s, earning him titles like 'Calypso King of the World' and praise from figures such as Colin Powell.[1][3]

Known for witty social commentary, humor, multilingual flair, and showmanship, Sparrow elevated calypso from a scorned form to a dignified global genre, receiving honors like the ORTT CM OBE, induction into halls of fame, and keys to cities like Detroit.[2][3][4]
