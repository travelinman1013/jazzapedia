## Biography
Electric Ramble is a rock and soul band born from the rich musical heart of New Orleans, Louisiana. The band was formed by four musicians: Evan Hall (vocals/guitar), Tyler Self (bass), William McMains (drums), and additional members who contribute to their dynamic live sound. The band has built a real audience through high-energy live performances and word-of-mouth growth, establishing themselves as an emerging force in modern rock and soul by blending raw roots music with contemporary sensibilities.

Evan Hall, the band's leader and primary creative force, developed his passion for music from childhood, drawing inspiration from classic rock, soul, and blues artists. His musical foundation was shaped by legends like Led Zeppelin, The Allman Brothers, Otis Redding, The Black Crowes, and Jimi Hendrix, with particular influence from Led Zeppelin's live performances at Royal Albert Hall. Electric Ramble's sound sits in the space between The Black Crowes, The Revivalists, and Marcus King—characterized by raw, roots-oriented rock with vintage soul elements and a modern edge that connects with audiences both locally and internationally.

The band released two singles in 2025, "Out of Time" and "Let It Roll," which were well-received in New Orleans and beyond. They are focused on releasing their debut album in 2026 while expanding their touring footprint and pursuing performances at major festival stages like the New Orleans Jazz Fest. With strong brand partnerships and growing press attention, Electric Ramble represents an emerging force in modern rock and soul music.
