## Biography
The Mitch Marcus Quintet was founded in 1999 by tenor saxophonist and composer Mitch Marcus, a native New Yorker who earned his Bachelor of Music in Jazz Studies from Indiana University's Jacobs School of Music in 1997, where he studied under renowned educators David Baker and Tom Walsh.[4][6] After graduating, Marcus relocated to the San Francisco Bay Area, where the quintet developed its distinctive sound over a ten-year residency that established it as one of the region's most innovative ensembles.[1][5] During this period, the San Francisco Chronicle recognized the group among the most provocative Bay Area ensembles, and in 2007 SF Weekly readers voted them the city's Best Jazz Band.[1] The quintet's music represents 21st-century jazz that combines the swing and collective improvisation traditions of pioneers like Charles Mingus, Thelonious Monk, and Sonny Rollins with experimental and progressive elements.[2][4]

The ensemble is co-led by alto saxophonist Sylvain Carton and features a rotating lineup of accomplished musicians including guitarist Mike Abraham, bassists George Ban-Weiss and Peter Brendler, and drummers Tomas Fujiwara and Jeff Marrs.[2][3] The group's musical identity is characterized by a melodic front line of two saxophones paired with a sometimes distorted guitar that straddles progressive jazz and experimental rock, drawing comparisons to Charles Mingus, Frank Zappa, and John Zorn's Masada project.[2] The quintet has composed over 100 original works that stretch jazz boundaries while remaining rooted in tradition, with the rhythm section serving as both propulsive force and structural element woven through the compositions.[3] After Marcus returned to New York in 2009, the band members dispersed across the coasts but continued as a dynamic national force, with the group maintaining active performance schedules and continuing to develop its innovative sound.[1][5]

Beyond the quintet, Mitch Marcus has established himself as a prolific composer and multi-instrumentalist working across diverse musical contexts.[4][5][6] He won a Subito grant from the American Composer's Forum for his MMQ + 13 big band compositions and received commissions from the DeYoung Museum in San Francisco and Oakland's Counterpointe dance company.[4][6] Marcus has accompanied major dance institutions including the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater and the Mark Morris Dance Group, and in 2013 was honored to open the SF Jazz Center's Joe Henderson Lab with an expansive concert of Henderson's music.[4][6] His versatility extends to performing with numerous Bay Area and national ensembles spanning progressive jazz, Afro-beat, folk music, and tribute projects.
