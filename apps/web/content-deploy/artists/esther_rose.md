## Biography
Esther Rose, born in Detroit and raised in Columbiaville, Michigan, spent her formative years there before relocating to New Orleans, Louisiana, where she immersed herself in the city's vibrant music scene and launched her career. She began collaborating with musician Luke Winslow-King, to whom she was married from 2013 to 2015, marking her entry into music. Her debut album, *This Time Last Night*, arrived in 2017, followed by *You Made It This Far* in 2019 on Father/Daughter Records, showcasing her evolution from traditional country influences toward a more personal, modern style blending americana, alt-country, folk, pop, and punk elements with heartfelt, emotive songwriting and a pure voice reminiscent of June Carter, Jimmie Rodgers, Rex Griffin, and Patsy Cline.[1][2][3][4][5][8]

Rose's career gained momentum with *How Many Times* in 2021 and *Safe to Run* in 2023 via New West Records, recorded after moving to New Mexico (specifically Santa Fe), where she explored multitracking, overdubs, and influences like Elliott Smith and Wilco amid personal transitions. Her fifth album, *Want*, released May 2, 2025, reflects breakthroughs from therapy, quitting drinking, and raw collaborations, leaning into confrontational arrangements, distortion, and themes of desire, accountability, and self-discovery while maintaining catchy melodies rooted in country storytelling.[1][2][3][5][6] Now based in Santa Fe, Rose continues to challenge herself by avoiding recycled chord progressions and pushing stylistic boundaries, transforming personal chaos into universally resonant music.[3][5]
