## Biography
Steve Masakowski, born Stephen Alphonse Masakowski on September 2, 1954, in New Orleans, Louisiana, developed an early passion for music influenced by The Beatles, leading him to play bass guitar at age fourteen in the rock band Truth, inspired by Cream. In high school, he shifted to guitar, studying harmony under a teacher who introduced him to jazz masters like Joe Pass, Wes Montgomery, Pat Martino, and Lenny Breau. He attended Berklee College of Music in 1974, earning a degree in music theory, arranging, and composition, then returned to New Orleans with jazz guitarist Emily Remler, co-founding the group Fourplay. From 1976 to 1978, he studied classical composition with Bert Braud at the New Orleans Center for Creative Arts alongside future stars like Terence Blanchard, Harry Connick Jr., Branford Marsalis, and Wynton Marsalis.[1][2][4]

In the early 1980s, Masakowski immersed himself in New Orleans' jazz scene, collaborating with local legends such as Earl Turbinton Jr., Alvin 'Red' Tyler, Willie Tee, Danny Barker, and James Black, while accompanying visitors like Randy Brecker, Tom Harrell, Dave Liebman, and Art Baron. He founded the electronic jazz group Mars with Larry Sieberth, James Singleton, and James Black, and co-established Composers Recording Studio with Patrice Fisher, Jimmy Robinson, and Denise Villere, recording artists including Harry Connick Jr., Ellis Marsalis Jr., and the Dirty Dozen Brass Band. Joining Astral Project in 1987, he toured with Dianne Reeves from 1993-1996, released albums on Blue Note Records, and leads Nova NOLA featuring his children, bassist Martin and vocalist Sasha Masakowski. His innovative style blends jazz, jazz fusion, Afro-Cuban, and Brazilian elements, showcased through his inventions like the guitar-based keytar, switch pick, and custom seven-string guitars.[1][2][3][5]

As an educator, Masakowski joined the University of New Orleans (UNO) jazz program under Ellis Marsalis, becoming Chair of Jazz Studies in 2004 and holding the Coca-Cola Endowed Chair until retiring in 2022. His legacy includes numerous recordings, compositions for Astral Project, a book on jazz ear training, lessons in Guitar Player magazine, and repeated accolades as New Orleans' top guitarist by Gambit and Offbeat magazines, plus DownBeat recognition.[1][2][4]
