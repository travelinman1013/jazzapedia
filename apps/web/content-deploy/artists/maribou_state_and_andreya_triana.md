## Biography
Andreya Triana is a British singer-songwriter from South East London, known for her experimental blend of soul, jazz, pop, and improvisation, drawing from her multicultural background. Born in London, she moved to Worcestershire at age 14, where at 17 she began performing at open mic nights, leading to the formation of the group Bootis. While studying music technology in Leeds, she developed her signature Freeflo Sessions—a live looping performance using a sampler for vocals, percussion, and beats—which earned her a spot at the Red Bull Music Academy in Australia in 2006, fostering key industry connections.[1][2][3]

Her career breakthrough came through collaborations, notably with Bonobo (Simon Green), whom she met at the Academy; he produced her debut album *Lost Where I Belong* (2010) on Ninja Tune, praised as the 'Best Album of 2010' by *Spin*. Subsequent albums include *Giants* (2013) and *Life in Colour* (2019) on Hi-Tea Records, produced partly by Dimitri Tikovoï. Triana achieved chart success featuring on Breach’s 'Everything You Never Had (We Had It All)' (No. 7 UK, 2013), performed at Glastonbury (2015), sold out KOKO, and reached 50,000 at BBC Radio 2 Live in Hyde Park (2016). Since 2021, she has toured as a backup vocalist with Jungle, and in 2020 became fully independent, expanding into production and DJing.[1][2][3][4]

Triana's smoky, husky voice embodies empowerment and self-love, with songs like 'Gold', 'Woman', and 'Song For A Friend' featured in TV and film. Nominated for MOBO Best R&B/Soul Act (2015) and invited as an Ivor Novello judge (2016), her legacy lies in bridging improvisation with electronic, soulful pop, influencing neo-soul scenes while maintaining artistic independence.[1][3][5]
