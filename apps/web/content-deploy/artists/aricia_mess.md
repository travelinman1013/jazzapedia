## Biography
Arícia Mess was born in Niterói, Brazil, and emerged as a singer in the vibrant underground music scene of Rio de Janeiro during the 1990s. She quickly gained success in nightclubs and on stages with a 9-piece band, blending pop, funk, soul, and Afro-Brazilian rhythms, establishing herself as a dynamic performer known for singing, dancing, and touring.[7][4][1] Today based in São Paulo, her early career laid the foundation for a distinctive style celebrating Afro-Brazilian womanhood, black pride, and connections between Africa, Brazil, and the Caribbean.

Throughout her career, Arícia Mess has composed, produced, and released multiple albums, including her third full-length 'Versos do Mundo' on Koro Koro Music, recorded while traveling between São Paulo, London, and Lisbon. This period of global movement inspired themes of encounters, losses, dreams, and creative freedom, fusing elements like samba de roda from Bahia, coco de roda from Pernambuco, ijexá from Candomblé, Jamaican bass lines, and Angolan kizomba. She hosts an internet radio program and has toured extensively in Europe, including Berlin, Paris, Portugal, and London, while releasing over 13 projects on Bandcamp.[1][2][3]

Described as the 'Queen of psyco-quilombolas, radical batuques...Afro-shock-chic,' Arícia's powerful, refined voice recreates cultural links with a focus on the natural forces of womanhood. Her work has appeared in international compilations, and despite pandemic delays, her music continues to roam freely, emphasizing fantasy, praise for music's power, and cross-cultural unity.[1][2][3]
