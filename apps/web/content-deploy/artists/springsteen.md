## Biography
Bruce Frederick Joseph Springsteen was born on September 23, 1949, in Long Branch, Monmouth County, New Jersey, and grew up in a working-class family in Freehold, New Jersey. By the late 1960s, he was immersed in the Asbury Park music scene, playing in bands like Steel Mill, where he first connected with future E Street Band members, forging his gravelly baritone voice and unique sound blending rock with poetic, socially conscious lyrics about working-class American life[2][3][5][6]. In 1972, he signed with Columbia Records and formed the core of the E Street Band for his debut album Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J., earning the nickname 'The Boss' for handling the band's pay[3][5].

Springsteen's career breakthrough came with 1975's Born to Run, after intense studio sessions marked by perfectionism, personnel changes including Roy Bittan and Max Weinberg joining the band, and production help from Jon Landau, who replaced Mike Appel as producer amid label turmoil[1][2][5]. A bitter legal battle with manager Appel from 1976-1977 halted recording, leading to extensive 'Lawsuit Tours,' but settlement allowed Darkness on the Edge of Town (1978), a rawer hard rock shift[1][2][4][5]. He pioneered heartland rock, with hits like Born in the U.S.A. (1984) making him a cultural phenomenon, followed by periods of solo work like Nebraska (1982) and The Ghost of Tom Joad (1995), reunions with E Street Band, and recent releases like Letter to You (2020)[2][3][5][6].

Known for marathon energetic concerts lasting over four hours, Springsteen has released 21 studio albums across six decades, won 20 Grammy Awards, and was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1999. His legacy endures through vivid narratives of struggle and resilience, with his 2016 autobiography Born to Run topping bestseller lists[2][3][5][8].
