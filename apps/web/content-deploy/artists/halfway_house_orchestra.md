## Biography
The Halfway House Orchestra was the house band at the Halfway House, a popular roadhouse and dance hall located midway between New Orleans and Lake Pontchartrain along the New Basin Canal, which flourished from 1914 to 1930. Led by cornetist Albert 'Abbie' Brunies from the legendary Brunies musical family of New Orleans, the band performed there from 1919 to 1928, blending dance band polish with hot jazz elements characterized by Brunies' punchy, Keppard-like cornet phrasing, balanced polyphony, and crisp arrangements.[1][2][3][5][6]

The ensemble recorded 22 sides across eight sessions between 1925 and 1928, starting with two tracks for Okeh in January 1925 featuring a four-horn frontline including trombone, then shifting to Columbia for subsequent sessions with a more streamlined lineup of cornet, reeds, piano, banjo, drums, and later brass bass. Their style evolved from raw, jazzier early efforts like 'Pussy Cat Rag' (co-composed by Brunies, Charlie Cordella, and Mickie Marcour) to polished swings on tunes such as 'Snookum,' 'Maple Leaf Rag,' and 'New Orleans Shuffle,' showcasing strong rhythm sections and versatile reed work.[1][3][4]

Though primarily a white dance band of the 1920s New Orleans scene, the Halfway House Orchestra left a legacy through their well-preserved recordings, remastered in collections like Jazz Oracle BDW 8001, highlighting their musicality, immediacy, and influence on traditional jazz preservation. The venue itself stood until abandonment in 1995, later serving various purposes including a pest-control site.[2][3]

## Fun Facts
- The band's name derives from the Halfway House venue, so named for its midpoint location between New Orleans and Lake Pontchartrain, which later became an Orkin pest-control building before abandonment in 1995.[2][5]
- Their 1925 Okeh debut was the only session with trombone in the lineup, creating a rare four-horn polyphony on tracks like 'Pussy Cat Rag,' after which it was dropped for a leaner sound.[1][3]
- Clarinetist Sidney Arodin's 1928 solos, such as on 'Just Pretending,' strikingly prefigure Artie Shaw's style from a decade later.[3]
- The band recorded without bass until 1926, relying on banjo and drums for drive, as heard in early Columbia sides.[1]
