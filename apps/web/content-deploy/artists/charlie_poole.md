## Biography
Charles Cleveland Poole (March 22, 1892 – May 21, 1931) was born in Randolph County, North Carolina, in a cotton mill area, with family roots tracing to places like Millboro in Franklinville Township and Alamance County; he grew up among mill workers, learning banjo from a second cousin skilled in classical style and making his first instrument from a gourd before buying one for $1.50 and teaching himself.[1][2][3][4][6] A childhood baseball accident smashed his right hand, curling his fingers and inspiring his distinctive three-finger picking banjo technique—a blend of melody, arpeggio, and rhythm that differed from clawhammer or later Scruggs styles and influenced bluegrass development.[1][2][3][4] Around 1917-1918, while rambling and busking, he met fiddler Posey Rorer in West Virginia, married Rorer's sister, and settled in Spray (now Eden), North Carolina, forming the North Carolina Ramblers with Rorer and guitarist Norman Woodlief.[1][2][3][5]

In 1925, the Ramblers auditioned in New York for Columbia Records, signing a contract and recording their debut 'Don't Let Your Deal Go Down Blues,' which sold over 102,000 copies—far exceeding the typical 5,000-20,000 for a hit—launching their career.[1][3][4] Over the next five years (1925-1930), they recorded over 60 traditional folk songs like 'White House Blues,' 'Sweet Sunny South,' 'If I Lose,' 'Milwaukee Blues,' and 'Take a Drink on Me,' achieving nearly one million total sales and popularity across the Southeast, especially among mill workers, at dances, and in mountain/coal communities.[1][2][3][4][5][7] Poole's high-pitched vocals, dynamic renditions mixing ragtime, blues, parlor songs, and minstrel elements, and consistent string band sound—with rotating members like guitarists Roy Harvey and Norman Woodlief, and fiddlers Posey Rorer, Lonnie Austin, and Odell Smith—made them stars, though Poole composed few originals.[1][2][5]

Poole's reckless 'rambler and rounder' lifestyle of traveling, brawling, philandering, and drinking ended abruptly; after heavy celebration following a 1931 recording session, he suffered a stomach hemorrhage and died at age 39 in Spray, North Carolina.[1][2][3] His pioneering old-time music, banjo innovations, and hits remain standards in country, bluegrass, and folk, influencing revivalists and artists from Bob Dylan and Jerry Garcia to John Mellencamp and Billy Strings.[1][2]
