## Biography
Marcus Trummer is a Calgary-born Canadian musician, singer, songwriter, and guitarist known for his soul blues style that blends modern sensibilities with traditional influences from the 1960s and 1970s. Described as a 'young blood with an old soul,' the precocious artist, who was 23 years old as of 2024, began his musical journey early, drawing initial inspiration from blues, soul, and rock via self-study on YouTube, evolving from southern rock influences like the Allman Brothers Band to a soul-rooted blues sound. A pivotal moment came during a solo road trip through the United States, visiting musical hubs like New Orleans, Memphis, and Austin, which inspired his songwriting and solidified his commitment to a professional career in music.[1][2][4][5][6]

Trummer's career gained momentum with early accolades, including the Prophets of Music’s Emerging Artist Award in 2019 and Calgary’s YYC Music Awards Emerging Artist Award in 2022, followed by a nomination for New Artist of the Year at the Maple Blues Awards in Toronto that same year. In 2023, he won the Telluride Blues Challenge in Colorado, leading to his US debut at the Telluride Blues & Brews Festival in 2024, and he received a nomination for Blues Artist of the Year at the 2025 Western Canadian Music Awards. His debut album, 'From The Start,' released around 2024-2025, showcases his warm, emotive vocals reminiscent of soul legends, expressive guitar work, and honest lyrics exploring love and coming-of-age themes.[1][3][4][5]

Trummer's musical style honors classic soul singers like Bill Withers, Al Green, and Marvin Gaye while channeling guitarists such as B.B. King, Jimi Hendrix, and modern influences like Gary Clark Jr., emphasizing authenticity, raw emotion, and depth shaped by blues traditions. As a rising figure, his legacy is emerging through award wins, festival performances, and a commitment to live shows that connect deeply with audiences, positioning him as a bridge between blues heritage and contemporary expression.[1][2][4][6]
