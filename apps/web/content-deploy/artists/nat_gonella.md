## Biography
Nathaniel Charles Gonella (7 March 1908 – 6 August 1998) was born in the Kings Cross area of London, England, to a cab driver father who died in 1915, leading to his placement in St Mary’s Guardians School in Islington where he discovered his passion for music and led the school's brass band. After a brief stint as a furrier's apprentice, his professional career began in 1924 with Archie Pitt’s Busby Boys band, touring for four years and discovering Louis Armstrong's music, which he transcribed and emulated. He progressed through bands like Bob Dryden’s Rivoli Rhythm Boys (playing violin, clarinet, and trumpet), Archie Alexander in Brighton, and Billy Cotton, where he made his first recordings including 'That Rhythm Man' and explored scat singing[1][2].

In the 1930s, Gonella joined Roy Fox at the Monseigneur Club, recording hits like 'Oh Monah!', 'Georgia on My Mind' (his signature tune), and duetting with Al Bowlly on 'Tell Me Are You from Georgia'. He met idol Louis Armstrong in 1932, solidifying his Armstrong-inspired trumpet style, gruff vocals, and showmanship. In 1935, he formed Nat Gonella and the Georgians, a successful swing band that played at the Palladium, produced hundreds of dance records, had a fan magazine, wore schoolboy blazers, toured Europe, appeared in films, and staged the show 'Swing It'. During World War II, he served in the army's Stars in Battledress, touring camps, then led big bands adapting to swing before smaller groups and solo variety acts[1][2][3].

Post-war, Gonella continued with bands like the New Georgians (70 recordings 1940-1941), toured with Max Miller, and made a 1960s comeback with his Georgia Jazz Band, featured on 'This is Your Life'. A 1970s Dutch tour with Ted Easton's band hit #5 with 'Oh Monah'. He retired to Gosport in the late 1970s, occasionally performing at the local jazz club, surviving 60 years in music alongside stars like Gracie Fields, Fats Waller, and Armstrong, earning a town square in his honor before passing at 90[1][2][3].
