## Biography
Lester Young, born Lester Willis Young on August 27, 1909, in Woodville, Mississippi, grew up in a musical family with his father as a music professor and his mother as a piano teacher. He began playing professionally in the early 1920s with territory bands in the Midwest, mastering tenor saxophone and clarinet while developing a light, cool, and relaxed style distinct from the heavier tones of contemporaries like Coleman Hawkins. After stints with bands including Bennie Moten and Fletcher Henderson in the early 1930s, Young settled in Kansas City, the jazz hub, and in 1936 joined Count Basie's orchestra, where his innovative phrasing and airy sound propelled the band to swing era fame during engagements like the Roseland Ballroom in New York.[1][2][3][4][5]

Young remained a cornerstone of Basie's band until around 1945, contributing iconic solos on tracks like 'Lady Be Good,' 'Every Tub,' 'Jumpin' at the Woodside,' and 'Lester Leaps In,' which showcased his sophisticated harmonies, elastic rhythms, and dancing improvisations that foreshadowed cool jazz and bebop. His tenure was interrupted by military service in the early 1940s, during which he faced hardship after a marijuana conviction, darkening his later tone. Post-Basie, he toured with Jazz at the Philharmonic, led his own groups, and reunited with Basie for the 1957 'Count Basie at Newport' album alongside Roy Eldridge.[1][2][3][4]

Young's legacy as 'Prez' (President of Tenor Saxophonists), a nickname from Billie Holiday, lies in pioneering the cool school of jazz with his free-floating, light-as-air style that influenced generations. Despite economic struggles compared to white bandleaders, his work defined swing's rhythmic head arrangements and blues-infused solos. He passed away on March 15, 1959, in Manhattan from cirrhosis-related issues, leaving an indelible mark on jazz tenor saxophone playing.[2][3][4][5]

## Fun Facts
- Billie Holiday nicknamed Lester Young 'Prez' (short for President of Tenor Saxophonists) due to his supreme status in jazz.
- Young did not record his first sides until 1936 at age 27, despite being a professional musician since around 1923; his debut on 'Lady Be Good' with Basie's small group was revolutionary.
- In 1936, Young boldly sent a telegram to Count Basie offering his services, perfectly timed as Basie headed to New York for a career-launching gig.
- His cool, light style contrasted sharply with Herschel Evans' heavier Hawkins-influenced approach in Basie's band, creating dynamic saxophone battles.
