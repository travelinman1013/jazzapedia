## Biography
Lole y Manuel, the flamenco duo consisting of Dolores 'Lole' Montoya Rodríguez (born 1954 in Seville, Spain) and Manuel Molina Jiménez (born 1948 in Ceuta, Spanish North Africa, died 2015), revolutionized flamenco in the 1970s by blending traditional elements with pop, rock, and hippie influences, making it accessible to younger audiences during Spain's post-Franco transition. Manuel, from a gypsy family, learned guitar from his father 'El Encajero' in Algeciras, where he met Paco de Lucía, before moving to Seville's Triana neighborhood and joining rock band Smash in 1968, pioneering 'rock andaluz.' Lole, from a flamenco dynasty including her mother Antonia 'La Negra' (born in Algeria) and dancer father Juan Montoya, grew up immersed in the art form. They met in Seville, formed the duo in 1972, married in 1975, and released their breakthrough album 'Nuevo Día' that year, topping charts with melodic vocals, innovative rhythms, and poetic lyrics that captured a 'new day' spirit.

Their 'hippie flamenco' or 'nuevo flamenco' style fused bulerías, tangos, and other cante with ethnic rhythms, Arabic melodies, and rock, topping Spanish charts throughout the 1970s and gaining international notice via Quentin Tarantino's use of 'Tu Mirá' in 'Kill Bill: Volume 2' (2004). After their 1980s divorce, they collaborated sporadically; Manuel continued solo, accompanying dancers like Farruquito and Manuela Carrasco, and later dueted with daughter Alba Molina, while Lole performed occasionally, including at Festival de Jerez (2004) and Fiesta de la Bulería (2015), maintaining her serene style into maturity. Their legacy opened doors for flamenco fusion artists, smoothing paths for figures like Paco de Lucía and Camarón de la Isla.
