## Biography
Los Muñequitos de Matanzas, a renowned Cuban rumba ensemble, was founded on October 9, 1952, in the barrio of La Marina, Matanzas, Cuba, initially as Conjunto Guaguancó Matancero. The group originated spontaneously when young rumberos, inspired by an Arsenio Rodríguez song playing at the El Gallo tavern, began drumming on countertops, glasses, and bottles, impressing onlookers and leading them to enlist singer Florencio Calle 'Catalino' as director. Original members included Catalino (guagua), Esteban Lantri 'Saldiguera' (vocalist), Juan Bosco (vocalist, claves), Hortensio Alfonso 'Virulilla' (vocalist, maraca), Gregorio Díaz 'Goyo' (tumba/salidor), Pablo Mesa 'Papi' (segundo/tres dos), and Angel Pellado 'Pelladito' (quinto), bringing street rumba authenticity, high-quality percussion with innovative drum conversations, and son septet-style harmonies to the stage.[1][3][5][6]

The group quickly gained traction, performing in Matanzas barrios like Simpson and La Marina, expanding to Havana venues, radio, and TV by 1953, and releasing their first 78 rpm record with Puchito Records. They issued their debut LP in 1956 and further albums like Guaguancó vols. 1 and 2 via Panart in 1958. After disbanding briefly in the early 1960s, they reformed by decade's end, solidifying their status with EGREM releases in the 1970s such as 'Óyelos de nuevo' and 'La chismosa del solar.' Known for innovating guaguancó—especially fluid salidor and segundo conga dialogues—they evolved in the 1980s under directors like Diosdado Ramos, incorporating broader folkloric elements while preserving authenticity, and toured internationally, including multiple U.S. visits from 1992 to 2002 and 2011.[1][2][3][4]

Today spanning four generations of Matanzas families, Los Muñequitos remain one of Cuba's most acclaimed rumba groups, celebrated for their virtuosic percussion, cultural preservation from Afro-Cuban traditions in Matanzas' port neighborhoods, and global influence on rumba and related genres like guaguancó.[1][2][6]
