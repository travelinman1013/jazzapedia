## Biography
Charles C. Jenkins II was born on December 14, 1975, in St. Petersburg, Florida, where he grew up attending the 10th Street Church of God and later a local Baptist church choir that sparked his interest in music. He received seven years of classical piano training and served as minister of music at Bethel AME in St. Petersburg, while being licensed to preach at age 16 and ordained two years later at Mount Zion Progressive Baptist Church. Jenkins moved to Chicago in 1996 to study at Moody Bible Institute and Trinity Evangelical Divinity School, eventually becoming Senior Pastor of the historic Fellowship Missionary Baptist Church, founded by Rev. Clay Evans, whom he succeeded at age 25 after a divine calling he described as a 'God story.'[1][3][4]

Jenkins launched his music career in 2012 with the single 'Awesome' and debut album *The Best of Both Worlds* under his Inspired People label, distributed by EMI Gospel, which topped Billboard's Gospel Albums chart and reached #41 on the Billboard 200. His follow-up *Any Given Sunday* (2015) also hit #1 on gospel charts, earning him GRAMMY recognition, 13-14 Billboard #1s, 9 Stellar Awards, and acclaim for blending traditional black gospel, urban contemporary gospel, and Christian R&B styles. As a multifaceted leader, he founded Fellowship Educational and Economic Development Corporation (FEED), served on numerous boards, and grew the church's membership significantly over two decades before transitioning to Pastor Emeritus.[2][3][4][5]

Jenkins' legacy combines pastoral innovation, community impact through education and job creation initiatives like a $26 million Legacy Project, and gospel music influence, with hits like '#War' and 'He’ll Make It All Right' continuing to chart. Married to Dr. Tara Rawls Jenkins, they parent three children, and he remains active as a film executive, fashion designer, and Morehouse College board member.[2][4][5]
