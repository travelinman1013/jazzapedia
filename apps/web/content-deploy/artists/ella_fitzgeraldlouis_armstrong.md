## Biography
Ella Jane Fitzgerald (April 25, 1917 – June 15, 1996) was an American singer, songwriter, and composer, sometimes referred to as the 'First Lady of Song,' 'Queen of Jazz,' and 'Lady Ella.' She was noted for her purity of tone, impeccable diction, phrasing, timing, intonation, absolute pitch, and a 'horn-like' improvisational ability, particularly in her scat singing. In her youth, Fitzgerald listened to jazz recordings by Louis Armstrong, Bing Crosby, and The Boswell Sisters, with Armstrong being one of her first musical idols. She gained acclaim as part of Chick Webb's orchestra at Harlem's Savoy Ballroom in the early 1930s, recording several hit songs before establishing herself as a major jazz vocalist.

Throughout her career, Fitzgerald worked with virtually all the jazz greats, from Duke Ellington and Count Basie to Frank Sinatra, Dizzy Gillespie, and Benny Goodman. Under manager Norman Granz's direction, she began producing her famous songbook series from 1956-1964, recording covers of other musicians' albums including those by Cole Porter, Duke Ellington, the Gershwins, Johnny Mercer, Irving Berlin, and Rodgers and Hart. Her flexible, wide-ranging voice allowed her to sing sultry ballads, sweet jazz, and imitate every instrument in an orchestra. She was a quintessential swing singer whose meetings with Count Basie were highly regarded by critics, and her 1963 album 'Ella and Basie!' is remembered as one of her greatest recordings.

## Fun Facts
- Louis Armstrong was one of Ella Fitzgerald's first musical idols, and she would perform 'Basin Street Blues' imitating his voice as a humorous tribute throughout her early career—a routine that can be heard and seen on different live performances.
- When Fitzgerald and Armstrong recorded their first album together on August 16, 1956, they were 19 years apart in age (Ella was 39, Louis was 55), yet their affinity was such that any generational barriers seemed to instantly dissolve. The front cover photograph shows them sitting comfortably next to each other in summer attire in the studio.
- In 1968, during a tour of England, Louis Armstrong appeared on the BBC radio show 'Desert Island Discs' and selected 'Bess, You Is My Woman Now'—his 1957 duet with Ella from their 'Porgy and Bess' album—as one of his eight treasured recordings that would give him solace if he were a castaway.
- When Louis Armstrong died in 1971 at age 69, Ella Fitzgerald was present at his funeral as an honorary pallbearer, alongside Frank Sinatra, Duke Ellington, and Bing Crosby, demonstrating the deep respect and affection between the two artists.
