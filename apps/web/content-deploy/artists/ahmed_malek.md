## Biography
Ahmed Malek was an Algerian musician and composer born in Fort-de-l'eau in 1930, who became renowned for his groundbreaking work in film soundtracks. He received formal training at music schools and conservatories in both Algeria and France, earning a degree in composition. His early work was rooted in North African classical traditions, and during his twenties he supported himself as a session musician while developing a deep fascination with jazz, classical music, and funky R&B.

Malek's artistic vision synthesized Arabic musical traditions with Western genres including jazz, psychedelic rock, and funk, creating distinctive cinematic soundscapes characterized by dark and dramatic orchestration. His innovative approach placed him alongside other pioneering African and European experimentalists of his era, including Ethiopian jazz musician Mulatu Astatke, the Guinean ensemble Bembeya Jazz National, and European composers like Piero Piccioni and Janko Nilovic. His work demonstrated how traditional Arabic music could be seamlessly integrated with contemporary Western musical forms, establishing him as a significant figure in world music composition.
