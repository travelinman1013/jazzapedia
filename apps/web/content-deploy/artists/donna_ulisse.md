## Biography
Donna Ulisse was born and raised in Hampton, Virginia, into a musical family where she was immersed in traditional sounds from an early age. Surrounded by her father's love for artists like the Osborne Brothers, she began performing young, singing at family parties as a toddler and later with a house band at her family's steakhouse by age 10-11. As a teenager, she performed with Jimmy Caldwell's western swing band and received crucial vocal training from her high school choir teacher, Barbara Davis. She married Rick Stanley, a cousin of bluegrass legends Ralph and Carter Stanley, which deepened her connection to Clinch Mountain music traditions.[1][2][3][4]

In the 1980s, Ulisse moved to Nashville, becoming a sought-after demo and background singer for artists like Jerry Reed. She signed with Atlantic Records through a deal with manager Dale Morris, releasing her debut country album *Trouble at the Door* in 1991, which charted two singles on Billboard and earned TV appearances on *Hee Haw*, *Nashville Now*, and others. After the deal ended, she focused on songwriting, particularly Appalachian and bluegrass-themed songs. Her publisher at Hadley Music Group encouraged her to record these, leading to her 2007 bluegrass album *When I Look Back*, followed by nine more releases with Hadley (2007-2015), then albums with Mountain Home Music Company (*Breakin’ Easy*, 2017, produced by Doyle Lawson) and Billy Blue Records (2019-?, including *Time For Love*, *Livin’ Large*, and *Mountain Lily*, with Lawson and Jerry Salley).[1][2][3][4]

Ulisse's style blends traditional country, bluegrass, gospel, and mountain music, characterized by narrative songwriting and a commanding voice true to her roots. Nominated multiple times for IBMA Songwriter of the Year, she won in 2016, followed by 2017 IBMA Song of the Year for 'I Am A Drifter' (co-written with Marc Rossi, recorded by Volume Five). She also earned SPBGMA Songwriter of the Year (2018, 2022, 2023) and 2022 Female Vocalist of the Year. Today, she tours with The Poor Mountain Boys, hosts songwriting workshops at her Wee Farm in Lebanon, Tennessee, and remains a respected figure in bluegrass as singer, songwriter, and educator.[1][2][3][4]
