## Biography
Cheikh Ibra Fam, born Cheikh Ibrahima Ousmane Fame in Mbour, Senegal, grew up in a musically rich household amid constant relocation due to his father's role as director of the Senegalese Customs Office. From an early age, he was immersed in diverse musical traditions, joining Kourels—traditional Senegalese spiritual choirs—at age seven while listening to Afro-Cuban records and the soul voice of Otis Redding at home. As a teenager, encouraged by his mother, he began composing and recorded his first song, "Djo Dja," which impressed his father enough to fund music lessons and help build a home studio. In 2006, under the stage name "Freestyle," he released his debut album and toured Senegalese schools, eventually releasing three albums that established his reputation domestically, though a harsh critical review of one song became a turning point that motivated him to refine his artistic identity.

Cheikh's musical direction transformed profoundly after joining Senegal's legendary Orchestra Baobab, where he spent six years performing globally and developing a deeper appreciation for African traditions. This experience prompted him to shift from his early hip-hop influences toward a distinctly pan-African style, singing in his mother tongues Wolof and Bambara while blending traditional rhythms with contemporary genres. Following his departure from Orchestra Baobab in 2022, he launched his solo career under his real name with the album "Peace in Africa," earning recognition as an RFI Talent and establishing himself as a multidimensional artist whose work combines Afropop, funk, jazz, soul, and roots music. Now based on Reunion Island, Cheikh continues to evolve artistically while advocating for music education in Senegal, particularly in jazz, inspired by his late mentor Issa Sissokho, and has taken up the tenor saxophone.

As a follower of the Baye Fall Muslim brotherhood, Cheikh infuses spiritual and social themes into his work, with tracks like "Midadi" (2012) promoting love and peace and "Jerejef" (2022) honoring spiritual leader Serigne Touba. In 2023, he received the Charles Cros Academy Award for "Cosaan," a tribute to African ancestry, and in 2024 collaborated with Christine Salem on "Niama," a musical commemorating the abolition of slavery on Reunion Island. His sophomore album, "Adouna" (Life), was released by Cumbancha in October 2025, with the lead single "Xam Xam" debuting April 10, 2025. Throughout his career, Cheikh has emphasized that his mission transcends personal achievement: "It's not about me. It's about the messages in my songs: love, tolerance, understanding, and justice."

## Fun Facts
- As a teenager, Cheikh would sing in the bathroom experimenting with melodies before his mother recognized his talent and encouraged him to pursue music seriously.
- His first song, "Djo Dja," was recorded without his father's knowledge and played for him later, which impressed his father so much that he became Cheikh's biggest supporter and funded his music lessons.
- A harsh music journalist review of one of his early songs became a turning point that motivated him to refine his craft rather than discouraging him from pursuing music.
- Cheikh grew up hearing Afro-Cuban music on his family's home stereo and fell in love with the voice of soul singer Otis Redding, influences that shaped his early musical taste alongside his spiritual upbringing in the Baye Fall Muslim brotherhood tradition.
