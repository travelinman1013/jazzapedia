## Biography
The Original Pinettes Brass Band, New Orleans' pioneering all-female brass band, was founded in 1991 at St. Mary's Academy, a historically Black Catholic girls' school in New Orleans East, under the direction of band director Jeffery C. Herbert. Herbert, a member of the Original Pinstripe Brass Band, assembled around 16 students from the school's marching band to form the Pinettes—a feminized version of his own group's name—and shifted their focus from traditional Dixieland jazz to contemporary New Orleans-style brass band music, highlighted by their 1992 performance of Rebirth Brass Band's 'Freedom.' Herbert continued managing the group after leaving St. Mary's in 1993-94 for John McDonogh High School and departed New Orleans in 1998 for Southern University, handing leadership to the members themselves.[1][2][6]

The band persevered through lineup changes, local second-line parades, and a modestly successful cassette release, but Hurricane Katrina in 2005 scattered members across the U.S., particularly to Houston. Bandleader Christie Jourdain, who started as a snare drum alternate, reformed the group by recruiting alumni from schools like Eleanor McMain, McDonogh 35, Warren Easton, and Xavier University Preparatory, creating a multigenerational ensemble of women from diverse backgrounds. A dispute with former members led to their name change to The Original Pinettes Brass Band. Their breakthrough came in 2013 with the release of their debut full-length album *Finally* and victory in the Red Bull Street Kings competition, where they triumphed over three male bands and rechristened it 'Street Queens.'[1][5][7]

Known for their energetic second-line parades and high-profile performances at events like Jazz Fest, Satchmo Summer Fest, Essence Fest, and international gigs in Turkey and Switzerland, the Pinettes have solidified their legacy as the world's only all-female brass band, elevating women in New Orleans' male-dominated brass culture while blending traditional jazz roots with modern brass band flair.[5][9]
