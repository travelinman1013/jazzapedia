## Biography
John Boutté was born on November 3, 1958, in the Seventh Ward of New Orleans, Louisiana, the eighth of ten children in a Creole-Catholic family.[1][2] Growing up in this culturally rich neighborhood, he was immersed in the sounds of jazz funerals, Mardi Gras parades, and the R&B music of artists like Stevie Wonder and Marvin Gaye.[1] During his school years, he played trumpet and cornet in junior high and high school marching bands, where he became a section leader, and also sang in street a cappella groups with names like "Spirit" and "Remnant."[2] He studied business at Xavier University of Louisiana while participating in ROTC, and after graduation was commissioned as an officer in the U.S. Army, where he served for four years and directed and sang in Army gospel choirs across Virginia, Texas, and Korea.[1][2]

After returning to the United States, Boutté initially worked for a credit union rather than pursuing music professionally.[1] His career trajectory changed when he met Stevie Wonder, who recognized his talent and encouraged him to pursue singing as a profession.[1] He joined his older sister Lillian Boutté on a European tour, which marked the beginning of his professional music career.[1] He was featured as a vocalist on Lillian's 1994 live album *Gospel United*, and released his debut solo album *Through the Eyes of a Child* in 1996.[1] Since the mid-1990s, Boutté has been active as a jazz singer known for a diverse musical style encompassing jazz, R&B, gospel, Latin, and blues.[1]

Boutté's most significant cultural contribution came through his composition "Treme Song," which became the theme song for HBO's series *Treme*.[1] He appeared in multiple seasons of the show, performing songs and serenading characters.[1] Throughout his career, he has earned numerous awards, including multiple Best Male Vocalist honors and wins for Best Latin Music Album, Best Traditional Jazz Album, and Song of the Year.[1] He is recognized as "the voice of New Orleans" and described as a soul singer of generational significance who sings for those in the city who lack a voice or have been forgotten.[2]
