## Biography
Hollie Cook, born in 1987 in West London, England, grew up in a musically rich household as the daughter of Sex Pistols drummer Paul Cook and Jeni Cook, a backing singer for Culture Club, with Boy George as her godfather. Of paternal English and maternal West Indian descent, she was immersed in music from a young age, gravitating towards artists like Marc Bolan, David Bowie, The Cure, and reggae influences from West London's Jamaican culture, which her father also loved. Her early career took a punk-reggae turn when she joined the re-formed all-female band The Slits around 2006, contributing vocals and keyboards to their EP *Revenge of the Killer Slits*, a US tour, and a new album recorded in L.A., where she was dubbed the 'second singer' by Ari Up.

Transitioning to a solo career from 2010, Cook collaborated closely with producer Prince Fatty (Mike Pelanconi), releasing her self-titled debut reggae album *Hollie Cook* in 2011, featuring George Dekker of The Pioneers and Dennis Bovell, which she branded as 'tropical pop'—a fusion of reggae, rocksteady singers like Janet Kay and Phyllis Dillon, and 1960s girl groups. Praised by the BBC as one of 2011's most enjoyable reggae albums, it led to appearances on *Later... with Jools Holland*, Stone Roses reunion support shows in 2012, and further releases including dub versions, *Twice* (2014 via PledgeMusic), *Vessel of Love* (2018 with guests like Jah Wobble and Youth), *Happy Hour* (2022), and *Shy Girl* (2025). Her style evolved into cosmic tropical pop and lovers rock, blending soul, R&B, and reggae experimentation while maintaining a haunting, unique voice.

Cook's legacy lies in bridging punk, reggae, and pop, carrying forward The Slits' feminist spirit into modern 'tropical pop,' with consistent critical acclaim and a distinct presence in the UK reggae scene, evidenced by her Spotify genres of reggae, dub, roots reggae, and rocksteady.
