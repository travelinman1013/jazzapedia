## Biography
Los Hombres Calientes is a New Orleans-based jazz ensemble founded in 1998 by trumpeter Irvin Mayfield, percussionist Bill Summers, and drummer Jason Marsalis, blending Afro-Cuban jazz, Latin rhythms, rhythm & blues, funk, and modern jazz elements into a danceable, cross-cultural sound that captivated audiences at venues like Snug Harbor and the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival.[1][2][5][7] The group quickly signed with Basin Street Records, releasing five albums including Volumes 1, 2, and 3, which highlighted Summers' deep knowledge of African and Cuban percussion rhythms alongside Mayfield's vibrant trumpet and Marsalis' dynamic drumming.[1][2] Yvette Bostic-Summers added vocals and percussion, Victor “Red” Atkins handled piano, and Edwin Livingston played bass, creating a serendipitous fusion that appealed to both jazz purists and younger dancers.[5]

The band's formation stemmed from late-night jam sessions at Bill Summers' New Orleans home, sparked by a phone call from Mayfield to Marsalis, who recommended Summers for his expertise in global percussion traditions.[2] Summers, a veteran of Herbie Hancock’s Headhunters and the Walter Payton Trio, brought decades of study in ethnomusicology from institutions like the Detroit Conservatory, Michigan Conservatory, and UC Berkeley, infusing the music with authentic African call-and-response, funk, and fixed rhythms from bells and shakers.[2][3][4] Irvin Mayfield, inspired by mentors like Wynton Marsalis, drove the group's cultural ambition, while the ensemble's 'New Urban' style incorporated European, Asian, African, jazz, and rap influences.[4][6]

Los Hombres Calientes achieved multi-award-winning success, establishing itself as a cornerstone of New Orleans' vibrant jazz scene and influencing the local music landscape through its innovative boundary-crossing sound.[2][6][7] Though Jason Marsalis later departed for solo pursuits, the group's legacy endures through its recordings and live performances, embodying New Orleans' multicultural heritage.
