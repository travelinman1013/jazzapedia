## Biography
Moran Lee 'Dock' Boggs was born on February 7, 1898, in West Norton, Virginia, the youngest of ten children in a musical family where his oldest brother played fiddle and banjo in clawhammer style, his sisters sang, and his father taught him singing. He developed a unique self-taught three-finger banjo picking technique influenced by local African-American blues musicians like Jim White and 'Go Lightning,' as well as his brother Roscoe and itinerant musician Homer Crawford, blending Appalachian folk with blues elements. Boggs began playing seriously around 1918 at parties while working in coal mines, married Sara in 1918, and was first recorded in 1927 for Brunswick Records after auditioning with liquid courage, producing hits like 'Sugar Baby' and 'Country Blues' that later appeared in Harry Smith's Anthology of American Folk Music.[1][2][3][4]

In 1928, Boggs formed Dock Boggs and His Cumberland Mountain Entertainers with Scott Boatwright on guitar, Melvin Robinette on fiddle, and Charley Powers on guitar, quit mining temporarily, bought a Gibson Mastertone banjo, and earned significantly from local performances amid the late 1920s recording boom. He recorded additional sides in 1929 for Lonesome Ace Hi-Ballers in Chicago with Emry Arthur and attempted further sessions, but the Great Depression, travel costs, stage fright, and personal setbacks like pawning his banjo led him to return to coal mining by 1938, living anonymously in Norton and Needmore, Virginia, until 1963.[1][2][4]

Rediscovered by folklorist Mike Seeger in June 1963 at his Needmore home—where Boggs had recently repurchased a banjo—Boggs revived his career during the folk revival, performing at the American Folk Festival in Asheville, Newport Folk Festival before 10,000, Carnegie Hall, and Smithsonian Folklife Festival, and recording three albums for Folkways Records. His raw, powerful style made him a seminal figure for contemporary folk musicians. Boggs died on his 73rd birthday, February 7, 1971.[1][2][3][4]

## Fun Facts
- Auditioned for his first Brunswick recording contract in 1927 after drinking half a pint of moonshine whiskey for nerve, using a borrowed banjo from a local music store.[1][2]
- Died on his 73rd birthday, February 7, 1971, exactly 73 years after his birth.[1][4]
- Formed his band in 1928 and earned $300-400 weekly at peak, enough to quit coal mining temporarily and buy a top Gibson Mastertone banjo.[1][2]
- His wife Sara opposed his music career due to associations with bootlegging, gambling, and 'the Devil’s music,' contributing to his return to mining.[4]
