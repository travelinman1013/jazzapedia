## Biography
José Monje Cruz, known as Camarón de la Isla, was born on December 5, 1950, in San Fernando, Cádiz, Spain, into a Romani family. His mother, Juana Cruz Castro, was a canastera, and his father, Juan Luis Monje, was a singer and blacksmith who died of asthma when Camarón was young, plunging the family into poverty. Nicknamed 'Camarón' (shrimp) by his uncle due to his fair skin and blond hair, he began singing at age five in local shows and at eight performed at inns and bus stops for money. By twelve, he won first prize at the Festival de Montilla flamenco contest, and at sixteen, he took top honors at the Festival del Cante Jondo in Mairena de Alcor, launching his professional career alongside friend Rancapino.[1][2][3][5]

Moving to Madrid in the late 1960s, Camarón performed at tablaos like Los Canasteros and Torres Bermejas, where he met guitarist Paco de Lucía in 1968. Their partnership revolutionized flamenco, producing nine albums from 1969 to 1977 that blended traditional cante jondo with innovative styles, creating the 'Canasteros' fandango and pioneering nuevo flamenco. After Paco de Lucía's departure, Camarón collaborated with Tomatito, releasing fusion albums like Leyenda del Tiempo (1979) and Soy Gitano (1989) with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, drawing criticism from purists for electric bass and rock elements but earning him rockstar status among youth. He married Dolores Montoya (La Chispa) in 1976, with whom he had four children, including guitarist Luis Monje.[1][3][5][6]

Camarón's health declined in the late 1980s from heavy smoking and drug use, leading to his death from lung cancer on July 2, 1992, in Badalona, Barcelona, at age 41. Buried in San Fernando before 100,000 mourners, his legacy as flamenco's greatest innovator endures, honored posthumously with awards like the Llave de Oro del Cante in 2000, a 2005 biopic, and a 2018 Netflix documentary.[1][2][3]
