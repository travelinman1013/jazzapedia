## Biography
Malcolm 'Papa Mali' Welbourne was born on May 6, 1957, in Vicksburg, Mississippi, and raised in Shreveport, Louisiana, where he absorbed the blues along Bayou Pierre from an early age.[1][2] He took up guitar at age four and began learning rock and blues by age eleven.[5] A pivotal moment came at age twelve when he witnessed The Meters performing on the back of a flatbed truck during Mardi Gras Day in New Orleans, an experience that profoundly influenced his musical direction.[5][6] By age fourteen, blues musician John Campbell took him under his wing, and Welbourne began taking the blues seriously.[5] At seventeen, he left home and spent years traveling throughout the South, playing guitar on streets for change, performing in juke joints, and backing up blues and soul singers.[5]

Papa Mali eventually settled in New Orleans, where he has performed in clubs for over twenty years.[2] His breakthrough came with his debut album Thunder Chicken (1999) on Fog City Records, produced by Dan Prothero, which allowed him to reflect warmly on his Shreveport upbringing for the first time in his adult life.[5] He followed this with Do Your Thing (2007), also on Fog City Records and produced by Prothero, featuring collaborations with Big Chief Monk Boudreaux and the Golden Eagles Mardi Gras Indians, Kirk Joseph, and Henry Butler.[5] His signature sound blends the blues of the 1920s and 1930s, the psychedelic sounds of the 1960s, and the funk of the 1970s into what critics have called 'voodoo space blues.'[1][3]

Beyond his solo work, Papa Mali has established himself as a respected producer and collaborator, working with artists including Ruthie Foster, Lavelle White, Omar and the Howlers, Wendy Colonna, and The Greyhounds.[1] He has performed alongside blues legends like B.B. King, jam band icons like Bill Kreutzmann, and funk pioneers like George Porter Jr.[4] By the 2000s, he was performing at major festivals throughout the United States and internationally.[5] His deep immersion in New Orleans Mardi Gras Indian culture came through his connection with Cyril Neville, who introduced him to Big Chief Monk Boudreaux, opening doors to acceptance within that community.[6]

## Fun Facts
- As a child in Shreveport, Papa Mali was so inspired by The Rolling Stones that while still in grade school, he convinced his cousin to take him into the French Quarter so he could buy every element of Brian Jones's outfit from the front cover of The Rolling Stones' 'High Tides & Green Grass' album.[5]
- Papa Mali grew up in a bayou environment where he learned to kill snakes at an early age not for sport but for self-defense, as water moccasins were everywhere in his swamp playground.[4]
- At age twelve, Papa Mali witnessed The Meters performing on the back of a flatbed truck during Mardi Gras Day in 1969, an experience so formative that seeing Dr. John perform his 'Night Tripper' set a year or two later solidified his musical direction by showing him it was possible for a white artist to authentically blend psychedelic, blues, and funk elements.[4][5][6]
- Papa Mali's stage name is a salute to his home territory of north Louisiana, where he was raised.[2]
