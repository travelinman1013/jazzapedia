## Biography
Bobby Marchan, born Oscar James Gibson on April 30, 1930, in Youngstown, Ohio, developed an early fascination with blues music and female impersonation during his adolescence. By his late teens, he formed and led the drag revue Powder Box Revue, performing in theaters before bringing the troupe to New Orleans in 1953, where he emceed and sang at clubs like the Dew Drop Inn and Club Tijuana. His recording career began in 1953-1954 with 'Have Mercy' for Aladdin Records, produced by Cosimo Matassa, followed by singles on Dot and Ace, including the regional hit 'Chickee Wah-Wah' in 1956-1957, showcasing his sophisticated blues style and raucous R&B energy.[1][2][3][4]

In 1957, Marchan joined Huey 'Piano' Smith and the Clowns as lead singer alongside Gerri Hall and Roosevelt Wright, contributing to New Orleans' iconic rock and roll hits while acting as the group's de facto boss on tour. He left in 1959 for a solo career on Fire Records, achieving his biggest success with the #1 R&B hit 'There's Something on Your Mind' in 1960, a cover of Big Jay McNeely's song enhanced with his signature spoken-word passages. Further hits included 'Shake Your Tambourine' (1966, Cameo-Parkway) and recordings for Stax/Volt after touring with Otis Redding; he also originated 'Get Down and Get With It' (Dial, 1965), later a hit for Slade. His style blended northern soul, doo-wop, and Motown influences with flamboyant showmanship.[1][2][3]

By the 1970s, Marchan returned to New Orleans club work as an MC and female impersonator at venues like Club Alhambra, performing regularly at the Jazz & Heritage Festival. In the 1980s, he founded Manicure Productions to promote hip-hop and bounce acts like DJ Jubilee, and contributed to Cash Money Records' formation. His final recording was a 1987 rework of 'There's Something on Your Mind' on Edge, and he passed away on December 5, 1999, after battling illness, with his last appearance at the 1999 Essence Festival.[1][2][3][4]
