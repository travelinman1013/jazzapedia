## Biography
Louis Hayes was born on May 31, 1937, in Detroit, Michigan, during a pivotal era for American jazz. He began his musical journey at age five on piano before switching to drums at ten when his father gave him his first drum set. His early development was profoundly shaped by his cousin Clarence Stamps, an accomplished drummer who provided foundational technical training, and by his exposure to big band radio broadcasts. As a teenager in Detroit's vibrant jazz scene, Hayes performed with future jazz stars including trombonist Curtis Fuller and multi-reed player Yusef Lateef, making his professional debut at Klein's Show Bar in Detroit at just 18 years old.

Hayes' breakthrough came in 1956 when pianist Horace Silver, upon the recommendation of bassist Doug Watkins and trumpeter Donald Byrd, recruited him to replace Art Taylor in the Horace Silver Quintet. This three-year tenure (1956–1959) established Hayes as a premier hard bop drummer and resulted in five classic albums including recordings of "Senor Blues." In 1959, he joined the Cannonball Adderley Quintet, where he remained until mid-1965, forming a celebrated rhythm section with bassist Sam Jones and recording hits like "This Here," "Jive Samba," and "Work Song." Hayes then joined Oscar Peterson's trio in 1965, becoming the only drummer hired twice by Peterson when he returned in 1971. Throughout the late 1960s and 1970s, he co-led bands with Junior Cook and Woody Shaw before establishing himself as a bandleader, often mentoring younger musicians and appearing at major jazz festivals.

Hayes' career spanning nearly seven decades has made him one of the great hard bop drummers in jazz history. His ability to shift seamlessly between driving hard bop and sensitive ballad playing, combined with his impeccable timing and sense of swing, earned him recognition as an NEA Jazz Master in 2023. Since 1989, he has led his own bands and co-founded the Cannonball Adderley Legacy Band with saxophonist Vincent Herring in 2002, continuing to perform and mentor new generations of musicians. His discography includes more than 500 album appearances as a sideman and over 20 recordings as a leader, cementing his status as a vital figure in jazz history.
