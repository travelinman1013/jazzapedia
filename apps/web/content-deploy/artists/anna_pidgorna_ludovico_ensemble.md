## Biography
Anna Pidgorna (b. 1985) is a Ukrainian-born, Canadian-raised composer, vocalist, and multimedia artist who blends traditional Ukrainian folk music with contemporary classical techniques, visual arts, writing, and even carpentry in her multifaceted practice. Raised in Canada after her birth in Ukraine, she developed an early interest in music through choir singing during her undergraduate studies at Mount Allison University in Sackville, New Brunswick, graduating in 2007, where she honed her vocal skills alongside composition. She pursued a master's degree at the University of Calgary in 2013 and later a PhD in music composition at Princeton University, participating in prestigious workshops with composers like R. Murray Schafer, Kaija Saariaho, Gary Kulesha, and Chen Yi.[3][4]

Pidgorna's career gained momentum through her deep engagement with Ukrainian heritage; in 2012-2013, funded by the Canada Council for the Arts and the Shevchenko Foundation, she traveled to Ukraine to record traditional folk musicians and singers, observing their techniques firsthand and using this material as inspiration for her own inventions rather than direct arrangements. This research informed works like the album *Invented Folksongs* (performed with the Boston-based Ludovico Ensemble), chamber operas such as *Plaything* (with librettist Maria Reva) and *Our Trudy*, and folk-inspired pieces including *On the Eve of Ivan Kupalo, Like doves with grey wings embracing, Weeping* and *Bridal train*. Her music, characterized by bold melodies, unexpected performative elements, and a unique vocal style blending folk chest voice with classical head voice and contemporary techniques, has been performed internationally in Canada, the USA, Europe, Ukraine, South Korea, and Uruguay, with representations like *Light-play through curtain holes* at the ISCM World New Music Days 2013 in Vienna and *The child, bringer of light* at Carnegie Hall.[1][2][3]

Pidgorna's innovative style extends to multimedia, inscribing scores on antique doors for works like *Through closed doors* or creating hand-printed panels for *Mirror, mirror*. A recipient of SOCAN Foundation Young Composers’ Awards and the Boston Metro Opera Contempo Fest 2014, she has collaborated with ensembles like So Percussion, Gryphon Trio, and Thin Edge New Music Collective, commissioned by New Music Concerts, Soundstreams, and 21C Festival, establishing her as a rising figure in contemporary music with a legacy of transcending folk boundaries through embodied, hybrid compositions.[3][4]

## Fun Facts
- Pidgorna invented her own dialect for *Invented Folksongs*, mixing Ukrainian pronunciations encountered during her field recordings to create an 'unrooted language of a transplanted child'.[2]
- She records vocals in Nashville while instruments are tracked in Boston by Ludovico Ensemble, then remixes them spatially for effects like call-and-response with herself.[1]
- Her violin duo *Through closed doors* is inscribed directly onto a restored antique door, serving as both score and performance stage.[3]
- Pidgorna taught herself to sing after realizing no existing vocalist could blend classical training with authentic Ukrainian folk chest voice techniques she observed in Ukraine.[2]
