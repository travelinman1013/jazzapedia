## Biography
Sonido Isleño is a Latin jazz group founded in 1996 and led by Grammy-nominated musician Benjamin Lapidus. The ensemble specializes in a sophisticated blend of jazz and Spanish-Caribbean folk music, drawing inspiration from the cultural heritage of Isleño communities—descendants of Canarian settlers throughout the Caribbean and Latin America. Under Lapidus's leadership as bandleader and musical director, Sonido Isleño has established itself as an internationally recognized ensemble, performing extensively throughout North and South America, Europe, and the Caribbean while maintaining a commitment to original compositions that honor their cultural roots.

The group has released five internationally acclaimed albums showcasing their distinctive sound that authentically merges jazz sophistication with Caribbean musical traditions. Lapidus, who holds a doctorate in music and was born into a family of musicians, began his musical training at age six on piano and has since mastered multiple instruments. His role as both composer and arranger has been central to defining Sonido Isleño's artistic identity, with the band serving as a vehicle for exploring and celebrating the musical contributions of Isleño culture to the broader Latin music landscape.

Sonido Isleño's work has earned critical recognition within the Latin jazz community, with the group's albums receiving international acclaim and contributing to the preservation and evolution of Spanish-Caribbean musical traditions in contemporary jazz contexts. The ensemble represents an important bridge between traditional folk music heritage and modern jazz innovation, demonstrating how cultural identity can be authentically expressed through sophisticated musical arrangements and original compositions.
