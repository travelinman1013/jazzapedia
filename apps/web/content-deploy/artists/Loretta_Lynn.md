## Biography
Loretta Lynn, born Loretta Webb on April 14, 1932, in Butcher Hollow, Kentucky, grew up in a poor Appalachian coal-mining family as the second of eight children to Melvin 'Ted' Webb and Clara Marie Ramey. Surrounded by music from a young age, she sang in church and was influenced by her family's traditions, though poverty and the Great Depression shaped her early life. At 15 (though some accounts initially reported 13 or 14), she married Oliver 'Doolittle' or 'Doo' Lynn, a 21-year-old veteran, and by age 20 had four children; the couple moved to Custer, Washington, where Doo worked in logging camps, and Lynn managed domestic life while nurturing her musical passion[1][2][3][4].

Encouraged by her husband, Lynn taught herself guitar and began performing locally in the late 1950s, forming the Trailblazers band with her brother Jay Lee Webb. Her debut single 'I'm a Honky Tonk Girl' (1960) on Zero Records gained traction through grassroots promotion, leading to a move to Nashville, a Grand Ole Opry debut in 1960, and a Decca Records contract. Hits like 'Success' (1962) and her signature 'Coal Miner's Daughter' (1970), drawn from her upbringing, established her as a bold voice in country music, blending honky-tonk, traditional country, and personal storytelling about women's lives. Mentored by Patsy Cline until Cline's 1963 death, Lynn joined the Grand Ole Opry in 1962 and became the top female country artist by the mid-1960s[1][2][3][4].

Lynn's legacy as the 'Queen of Country Music' spans over 60 years, with Grammy wins like 'After the Fire Is Gone' (1972) with Conway Twitty, a best-selling 1976 autobiography, and the Oscar-winning 1980 film 'Coal Miner's Daughter.' Known for feminist-leaning songs like 'Don't Come Home A-Drinkin' (With Lovin' on Your Mind),' she broke barriers for women in Nashville, fought publishing rights battles, and continued recording into her later years, including 'Full Circle' (2016). Married to Doo until his 1996 death, she raised six children and remained rooted in her coal miner's daughter identity[1][2][3][4][5].
