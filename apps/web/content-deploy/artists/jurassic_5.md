## Biography
Jurassic 5 is an American alternative hip hop group formed in 1993 in Los Angeles, California, emerging from the vibrant underground scene at the Good Life venue. The group originated from the merger of two crews: Rebels of Rhythm (Akil, Zaakir, and DJ Nu-Mark) and Unity Committee (Chali 2na, Marc 7, and Cut Chemist). They debuted with the single 'Unified Rebelution' in 1995 on TVT Records, followed by their self-titled EP in 1997, which was later expanded into a full album in 1998 after signing with Interscope Records. Their sound blended old-school hip hop influences with precise lyricism, turntablism, and group call-and-response vocals, drawing comparisons to classic crews like Treacherous Three and Cold Crush Brothers.[1][2][4][5][7]

The group's career peaked with albums like Quality Control (2000), which reached No. 43 on the Billboard 200, Power in Numbers (2002) at No. 15, and Feedback (2006) at No. 15. Known for their energetic live performances and conscious, fun lyrics amid the dominant g-funk era, they toured extensively, including with Fiona Apple and on the Warped Tour. Cut Chemist left in 2005 to pursue solo work, and the group disbanded in 2007 due to musical differences but reunited for live shows in 2013 and released a new track in 2014.[1][4][5][7]

Jurassic 5's legacy endures as pioneers of alternative hip hop, fostering the L.A. underground community alongside acts like Company Flow and Black Star. Their members have thrived individually, with Chali 2na collaborating with Linkin Park, Roots Manuva, and others, while the group remains celebrated for revitalizing group dynamics and turntablism in hip hop.[1][4][8]

## Fun Facts
- The band's name originated when Chali 2na played their track for a friend's mother, who joked they sounded like the 'Jurassic Five' instead of the Fantastic Five, and the name stuck.[4][5]
- They were part of the L.A. underground scene opposing g-funk, performing at events like Rat Race with live bands and Unity nights alongside Nas and Wu-Tang Clan.[7]
- Jurassic 5 tracks appeared in popular video games like Tony Hawk, NBA Live, and Madden, boosting their reach without mainstream radio dominance.[5]
- Though a sextet, their debut EP was titled Jurassic 5, playfully nodding to the mismatch with the name's '5' despite six members.[6]
