## Biography
Gabrielle Cavassa, born on July 5, 1994, in Escondido, California, to Italian descent parents, developed an early passion for music by obsessively listening to records, including Italian arias from her grandparents' turntable. Largely self-taught, she honed her unique vocal style and earned a Bachelor of Arts in Music from San Francisco State University, where she credits the Bay Area jazz clubs for her real education. In 2012, she competed on season 11 of American Idol, advancing to the Hollywood rounds before elimination.[4]

In 2017, Cavassa relocated to New Orleans, immersing herself in the local scene by touring with Adonis Rose and the New Orleans Jazz Orchestra, trumpeter Irvin Mayfield, and collaborating with drummer Jamison Ross, who produced her self-titled debut album independently released on August 21, 2020. Her breakthrough came in 2021 as co-winner of the International Sarah Vaughan Jazz Vocal Competition (after being a finalist in 2018), spotlighting her intimate, expressive vocal jazz style influenced by Billie Holiday, Phyllis Hyman, Ornella Vanoni, and Jeff Buckley. This led to her discovery by Joshua Redman's manager and a prominent feature on his 2023 Blue Note album 'where are we,' followed by extensive touring with his group through Spring 2025 and a guest spot on his 2025 album 'Words Fall Short' on 'Era's End.'[1][2][3][4]

Signed to Blue Note Records in August 2024, Cavassa's debut album is slated for Spring 2026 release, cementing her rising status in jazz with critical acclaim for her deep, rich, fragile voice and storytelling akin to whispering secrets. Based in New Orleans, her music confronts personal themes with sincerity, raw vibrato, and intuitive interpretations of standards and originals.[2][3][6]
