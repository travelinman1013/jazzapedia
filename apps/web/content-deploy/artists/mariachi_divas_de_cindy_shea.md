## Biography
Mariachi Divas de Cindy Shea is an all-female mariachi band founded in 1999 by trumpet player and musical director Cindy Shea in Los Angeles, California. Shea, of Irish and Italian heritage, studied music education and jazz performance at California State University, Fullerton, where she received a full scholarship from jazz icon Arturo Sandoval. Initially performing with salsa bands like Yari More and Celia Cruz, she discovered mariachi music in the early 1990s as a trumpet player for the all-female Mariachi Las Alondras. When that group disbanded in 1999, Shea formed Mariachi Divas, introducing innovative elements such as flutes, percussion, improvisation, original songs, English lyrics, and fusions with jazz, pop, and other genres to traditional mariachi and ranchera styles.[1][2][3]

A pivotal moment came in 2003 when talent booker Stan Freese discovered the band, leading to their role as the official mariachi of Disneyland Resort. This exposure propelled their career, resulting in 20-21 albums produced by Shea, who also composes, arranges, engineers, and leads the ensemble. In 2009, they made history as the first all-female mariachi band nominated for—and winning—a Grammy Award for Best Regional Mexican Album, followed by a second win in 2014, eight Grammy nominations, and three Latin Grammy nominations overall. Their sophisticated sound has featured in concerts, commercials, TV, film, and events like headlining a mariachi dinner theater in Anaheim in 2014.[1][2][5][7]

Shea's pioneering vision expanded to founding Mariachi Angelitas and Mariachi Espectacular, plus Shea Luna Music Publishing, fostering resilience and leadership among musicians. Despite early resistance as a non-Latina woman challenging mariachi traditions, the band has earned respect, representing women and Mexico globally while blending heartfelt traditions with groundbreaking innovation.[2][3][7]
