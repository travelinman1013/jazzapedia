## Biography
Harvey Mandel, born on March 11, 1945, in Detroit, Michigan, and raised in the Chicago suburb of Morton Grove, Illinois, began his musical journey playing bongos before switching to guitar as a teenager. He immersed himself in Chicago's vibrant blues scene, jamming with legends like Howlin' Wolf, Muddy Waters, Otis Rush, Albert King, and Buddy Guy at West Side clubs such as Twist City, despite often being underage. By age 20, he was a professional guitarist, making his recording debut on Charlie Musselwhite's 1966 album *Stand Back! Here Comes Charley Musselwhite's Southside Band*, where his relentless fuzztone, feedback-edged solos, and syncopated phrasing marked him as an innovator in electric blues.[1][2][3]

Mandel's career skyrocketed in the late 1960s when he joined Canned Heat, replacing Henry Vestine just in time to perform at Woodstock in 1969 and contribute to albums like *Future Blues*. He later played with John Mayall on the 1970 album *USA Union*, showcasing a cleaner country-ish tone. Nicknamed 'The Snake' by Barry Goldberg for his cracked leather jacket and slithery guitar licks, Mandel pioneered techniques like sustained feedback, multi-string bends, and two-handed fretboard tapping—years before Eddie Van Halen and others—on solo albums such as *Baby Batter* (1971), *The Snake* (1972), and *Shangrenade*. His session work peaked with The Rolling Stones' 1976 album *Black and Blue*, featuring on 'Hot Stuff' and 'Memory Motel' during their audition process to replace Mick Taylor.[1][2][3][4]

Throughout the 1970s and beyond, Mandel collaborated with acts like Pure Food and Drug Act (with Sugarcane Harris and Larry Taylor), Love, The Ventures, and Roxy Music, while touring as a power trio opener for Jeff Beck and performing in Ron Wood's Miami club Woody's house band alongside Bobby Keys. Relocating between Chicago, San Francisco, and Florida, he continued releasing albums like *Planetary Warrior* (1997) and forming groups such as Snake Crew and Electric Snake Band. Known for his psych-blues style blending blues-rock, jazz, and funk, Mandel's inventive electric guitar work, effortless sustain, and virtuosic phrasing have cemented his legacy as a pioneering 'guitarist's guitarist' still performing into his later years.[1][2][4][5]

- Played at Woodstock with Canned Heat after being recruited on short notice following an onstage argument that led to Henry Vestine's departure.
