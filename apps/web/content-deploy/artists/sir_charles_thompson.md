## Biography
Charles Phillip Thompson was born on March 21, 1918, in Springfield, Ohio, to a Methodist minister's family, spending his formative years in Colorado Springs, Colorado.[1] He initially studied violin but switched to piano at age six after local attitudes made clear that the violin was not considered an appropriate instrument for Black children.[1] His early breakthrough came at age 12 when Count Basie, then pianist for Bennie Moten's Orchestra, invited the young Thompson to sit in during a performance in Colorado Springs—an experience that profoundly inspired his interest in jazz.[1] Thompson's early career took him through territory bands in the Midwest, including work with Lloyd Hunter and Nat Towles, before he joined Lionel Hampton's inaugural big band in Los Angeles around 1940.[1] However, he found Hampton's musical direction constraining and left the band in Buffalo.

Thompson's most significant period came when he moved to New York in 1942 to join Lester Young's sextet at Café Society, where Lester Young bestowed upon him the nickname "Sir Charles" in the early 1940s.[1][4] During World War II, Thompson became a fixture on 52nd Street, earning the nickname "the house pianist of 52nd Street" for his ubiquity throughout the decade.[1] He was one of the few swing-era musicians who made a graceful, wholehearted transition to bebop, developing a light-fingered, spare piano style descended from Count Basie's approach but infused with bebop's harmonic innovations.[3] Thompson recorded extensively as a sideman and leader, working with jazz luminaries including Charlie Parker, Illinois Jacquet, Coleman Hawkins, Dexter Gordon, and Buck Clayton throughout the 1940s and 1950s.[1][3]

Thompson is best remembered for composing the jazz standard "Robbins' Nest" in 1947 with Illinois Jacquet, a mellow riff tune that became a jazz classic.[1][4] Beyond his pianistic contributions, he was also an accomplished organist and arranger who contributed arrangements to Count Basie, Lionel Hampton, Fletcher Henderson, and Jimmy Dorsey.[3] In the 1950s and 1960s, he toured extensively throughout the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico, and Europe, leading small groups and appearing as a sideman.[3] Thompson eventually settled in Japan, where he married his Japanese wife Makiko in the 1990s and lived from 2002 onward.[1][2] He continued performing until illness from colon cancer prevented him from doing so, passing away on June 16, 2016, near Tokyo at age 98.[1][2]

## Fun Facts
- Thompson was knighted by Lester Young with the nickname 'Sir Charles' in the early 1940s, a title he carried for the rest of his life.[1][4]
- Despite being very weak near the end of his life, Thompson insisted on playing piano for his wife Makiko, telling her 'This is for you, for this might be the last chance.' He played for an hour with much feeling.[1]
- Thompson's composition 'Robbins' Nest' was named after Fred Robbins, a popular radio personality and disk jockey of the 'Robbins Nest' radio show on New York stations WINS, WABC, and WNEW.[4]
- At age 12, Thompson was already performing at private parties with the Bennie Moten band, and his early experience with Count Basie during a sit-in performance in Colorado Springs became a pivotal moment that launched his jazz career.[1][2]
