## Biography
Mason Via, pronounced /vaɪ/, is an American singer-songwriter and guitarist born and raised in Danbury, North Carolina, straddling the Virginia-North Carolina border in the Appalachian region. Growing up in rural Stokes County near Hanging Rock State Park, he was immersed in bluegrass traditions from a young age. His father, David Via, a renowned bluegrass songwriter and winner of the 2009 International/American Folk Alliance Songwriters Contest and three-time Chris Austin Songwriting contest winner, taught him acoustic guitar starting at age 12. Mason also studied under accomplished musicians Rex McGee, Ryan Cavanagh, and Clay Jones. A naturally gifted singer, he picked up mandolin as well, winning regional competitions as a teenager, including runner-up in the 2019 FloydFest On The Rise competition and three-time winner of the Shakori Hills Grassroots Festival band competition. He completed a Virginia Folklife Songwriter apprenticeship with his father, honing his songwriting skills amid fiddlers conventions, banjo competitions, and picking parties.[1][2][3][6]

Via's career accelerated in his early 20s. In December 2019, at age 23, he moved to Nashville, TN, undeterred by immediate challenges like tornadoes and COVID-19. He competed on American Idol season 19 under the stage name Mason Picks. His solo debut, the self-released *Up, Up, Up*, arrived in 2015, followed by *New Horizons* on Mountain Fever Records in 2022, championed by NPR and The Oxford American. From 2021 to 2024, he served as the youngest member of Old Crow Medicine Show, touring worldwide, contributing guitar, lead vocals, and songwriting to their Grammy-nominated album *Jubilee*. He has also contributed songs to Grammy-winning and nominated records by Molly Tuttle and Del McCoury Band, and collaborated with Sierra Hull (likely Ferrell in context). In 2025, he released his self-titled album on Mountain Fever Records, produced by Aaron Ramsey in Floyd County, Virginia, blending progressive bluegrass, Americana, Appalachian funk, and soulful acoustics with flat-picking and harmonies. Critics praised it as 'modern bluegrass at its best.' Now based between Gainesville, FL, and Nashville, Via headlines events like the Levitt AMP Sheboygan Music Series and hosts the Brewgrass Jam with his band Hot Trail Mix.[1][2][3][4][5]

Via's musical style fuses traditional Appalachian roots with innovative twists, interpolating old fiddle tunes into fresh songs like 'Wide Open,' while honoring three-part harmonies in tracks like 'Oh Lordy Me' and 'Mountain Lullaby.' His energetic stage presence, compelling narratives, and eclectic mix of bluegrass, folk, groovy Americana, and country have positioned him as a leader in modern roots music, listed by NPR among the top 10 bluegrass artists thriving in Nashville.[1][2][4]
