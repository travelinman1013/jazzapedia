## Biography
Queen C. Anderson (born July 24, 1913 – died April 13, 1959) was a pioneering gospel singer whose career was shaped by her mentorship under Reverend W. Herbert Brewster in Memphis, Tennessee. Originally named T.C. Anderson, she received her stage name from Brewster, who felt she possessed the beauty and stature of a queen and named her after Queen Candace of Ethiopia. Anderson became a member of the Brewsteraires and was the first vocalist to perform many of Brewster's compositions, establishing herself as a crucial interpreter of his innovative gospel arrangements during the Golden Age of gospel music in the 1940s and 1950s.

As a member of Brewster's vocal ensembles, Anderson debuted several songs that would become gospel classics, most notably "Move On Up a Little Higher," which was later made famous by Mahalia Jackson after Anderson performed it at a Chicago program attended by Jackson. Her vocal abilities and interpretive skills were instrumental in bringing Brewster's compositions to life, with the reverend noting that Anderson had an exceptional ability to take over and complete songs after hearing them only once. Though her recording career was relatively brief due to her early death at age 45, Anderson's contributions to gospel music were significant in establishing the template for how Brewster's innovative compositions would be performed and celebrated.

Anderson's legacy is intertwined with the broader success of Brewster's songwriting and the development of modern gospel music. Her performances helped launch the commercial success of other artists who recorded Brewster's works, and she remains remembered as a pioneering vocalist who helped shape the emotional and spiritual intensity that defined gospel music's golden era. Though often overshadowed by the later fame of artists like Mahalia Jackson and Clara Ward who recorded Brewster's songs, Anderson's original interpretations were foundational to establishing these compositions as gospel standards.

## Fun Facts
- Anderson's original name was T.C. Anderson, but it became so completely replaced by her stage name 'Queen C. Anderson' that her original name was 'almost forgotten' in gospel music history.
- Reverend Brewster specifically chose Anderson to interpret his songs because of her exceptional ability to learn compositions quickly—he would begin teaching her a new song and she would 'take over and complete that which she had heard before.'
- Anderson's recording of "Move On Up a Little Higher" became historically significant when Mahalia Jackson heard her perform it at a Chicago program and subsequently recorded the song, which became Jackson's 1947 breakout hit and one of gospel music's first million-sellers.
- Despite being the original performer of several Brewster compositions that became gospel standards, Anderson died at age 45 in 1959, before achieving the widespread fame that later artists like Mahalia Jackson and Clara Ward attained with the same songs.
