## Biography
Joseph 'King' Oliver, born around 1881-1885 in Abend or Aben, Louisiana, and raised in New Orleans, emerged as a pioneering jazz cornet player and bandleader. He began his career playing with brass bands like the Melrose Brass Band, Olympia Band, Onward Brass Band, and notably Kid Ory's band, considered the finest in New Orleans. By the early 1920s, Oliver moved to Chicago, forming King Oliver's Creole Jazz Band at Lincoln Gardens (formerly Royal Gardens), where he popularized New Orleans-style collective improvisation, known as Dixieland jazz, through landmark 1923 recordings for Gennett, Okeh, Paramount, and Columbia, including classics like 'Dippermouth Blues' and 'Canal Street Blues'.[1][2][3][4][7]

In 1925, Oliver reorganized into the larger King Oliver and His Dixie Syncopators at Chicago's Plantation Café, incorporating saxophones, written arrangements, and dance-oriented music to meet commercial demands, recording for Brunswick and Vocalion. The band toured the Midwest, played New York's Savoy Ballroom, and competed with Louis Armstrong's group, but faced challenges including a rejected Cotton Club offer (taken by Duke Ellington), venue fires, and internal issues, leading to its breakup by 1928. Oliver continued with freelance work, sideman sessions for blues singers like Sippie Wallace and Sara Martin, and a Victor contract with his orchestra until 1930, though gum disease hampered his playing.[1][3][4][5][6]

Oliver's later years were marked by financial struggles amid the Great Depression and health issues from periodontitis, forcing him to rely on sidemen for solos and eventually quit playing in 1937. He died in 1938 in Savannah, Georgia. His innovative cornet 'talking' style, ensemble leadership, and role in spreading jazz nationally cemented his legacy as a foundational figure.[3][4][7]
