## Biography
Zeshan Bagewadi, known professionally as Zeshan B, was born in Chicago to Muslim Indian immigrant parents. A Chicago native, he initially pursued Italian opera due to his vocal aptitude and opportunities in conservatories, but ultimately gravitated toward soul music as his 'true north,' viewing all other genres through that lens. Recognizing that opera did not align with his authentic self, he transitioned to blending 1960s and 1970s soul rhythms and horn-heavy sounds with Indo-Pakistani film and folk vocal stylings, creating a unique genre.[1][2][3]

His breakout album *Vetted* arrived in April 2017, debuting at #8 on Billboard's Top 10 Albums (World Music) and #1 on iTunes’ World Music chart, earning acclaim from Rolling Stone, NPR, and others. The single 'Cryin in the Streets,' a reinterpretation of George Perkins' 1970 civil rights anthem, drew praise from the New York Times and Chicago Tribune for its musical finesse and socio-political relevance. Zeshan debuted on US television with a performance on CBS’s *Late Night with Stephen Colbert* in 2017 and featured in a PBS NewsHour special 'Groovin’ for Change.' He has performed for Presidents Jimmy Carter and Barack Obama, including at the White House’s 2016 Eid Celebration, and toured venues like Lincoln Center, Bonnaroo, and the Kennedy Center. During the COVID-19 pandemic, he discussed its impacts on MSNBC’s *Morning Joe* with his wife, Dr. Alexandra Roybal, ahead of his NPR-acclaimed album *Melismatic* in May 2020. In 2022-2023, he held residencies at Doris Duke Shangri-La Museum in Honolulu and Lincoln Center, now splitting time between Chicago and New York while preparing *O Say, Can You See?*, executive produced by Preet Bharara.[1][2][4]

Zeshan B sings in English, Urdu, and Punjabi, channeling influences like Sam Cooke, Marvin Gaye, and Otis Redding while infusing South Asian roots to address civil rights, injustice, and solidarity between oppressed groups. His music tackles instability, loss, urban despair, and empowerment, as seen in *Melismatic* singles 'Brown Power' and 'Nausheen,' which celebrate collective justice and resilient South Asian women.[2][3][4]
