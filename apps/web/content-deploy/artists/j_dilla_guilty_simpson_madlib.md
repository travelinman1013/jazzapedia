## Biography
J Dilla (James Yancey), Madlib (Otis Jackson Jr.), and Guilty Simpson form a key collaborative trio in underground hip-hop, most notably connected through the 2003 album Champion Sound by the duo Jaylib (J Dilla and Madlib), which featured Guilty Simpson on the track 'Strapped'. J Dilla, born in Detroit, Michigan, and Madlib, from Oxnard, California, began their partnership in 2000 when Madlib received unused beats from Dilla via DJ J Rocc and recorded vocals over them, leading to the Jaylib moniker. They created Champion Sound remotely by exchanging beat CDs, with Dilla handling rhymes over Madlib's production and vice versa, embodying a raw, grimy style blending plunderphonics, alternative hip hop, and jazz rap. Guilty Simpson, a Detroit rapper, debuted nationally on this project at Dilla's invitation and later signed to Stones Throw Records at Dilla's request in 2006.[1][2][3]

Their careers intertwined further through shared Detroit-LA scenes: Dilla mentored Simpson, producing tracks like 'Stress' and 'Take Notice' for an unrealized full-length album before Dilla's death in 2006, teaching him song-building precision. Madlib and Simpson teased a collaboration titled 'OJ Simpson' via Madlib's Medicine Show series, highlighting their ongoing ties to Dilla's gritty, innovative sound—Dilla's slumping beats and Madlib's jagged grooves emphasizing unpolished hip-hop authenticity. The trio's work on Champion Sound and subsequent projects solidified their influence in beatmaker-rapper dynamics.[2][4][5]

Champion Sound's legacy endures as a hip-hop classic, praised for its rugged rhymes and production that inspired future underground artists, with Dilla's vision of 'official' collaboration pushing raw creativity. Simpson carried forward Dilla's lessons in his solo work like Ode to the Ghetto (2008) and groups like Random Axe, while Madlib continued prolific output, ensuring the trio's plunderphonic style remains a benchmark for alternative hip hop.[1][2][3]
