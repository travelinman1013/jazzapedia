## Biography
N.E.R.D. (stylized as N*E*R*D, a backronym for No-one Ever Really Dies) is an American hip hop and rock band formed in Virginia Beach, Virginia, initially in 1994 as a side project of the production duo The Neptunes, with core members Pharrell Williams (vocals, keys, drums), Chad Hugo (guitar, bass, saxophone), and Shay Haley (drums).[1][2][3] Williams and Hugo met at age 12 in a band class in Virginia Beach, where Hugo was drum major for Kempsville High School and Williams played in Princess Anne High School's drumline; they were signed by producer Teddy Riley in 1991 after a talent show performance, leading to production work before forming N.E.R.D.[2] The band's debut album *In Search of...* (2001 in Europe, rerecorded with live instruments by Spymob for 2002 worldwide release) blended hip-hop, rock, and funk, achieving gold certification in the US with 603,000 copies sold; it was followed by *Fly or Die* (2004), also gold-certified.[1][2][3]

After a label dispute with Virgin Records in 2005, N.E.R.D. disbanded temporarily but reunited in 2008 under their Star Trak Entertainment imprint (a subsidiary of Interscope), self-funding their third album *Seeing Sounds*, which debuted with the single 'Everyone Nose' and drew from post-punk influences like Gang of Four and Talking Heads.[2][3][4] The band emphasized live instrumentation on later works, with Williams on drums and Hugo learning guitar, distinguishing their eclectic electroclash-rock-funk sound from Neptunes' rap productions.[2][4] Their fourth album *Nothing* arrived in 2010, showcasing a mélange of R&B, rap, pop, and rock.[5] Known for nerdy aesthetics and innovative genre fusion, N.E.R.D. toured with acts like Kanye West and Rihanna, building a cult following despite modest sales.[2][4]

N.E.R.D.'s legacy lies in bridging hip-hop production with live rock energy, influencing alternative rap and funk scenes while allowing Williams and Hugo to explore beyond mainstream hits; the band remains active periodically, embodying a DIY ethos post-hiatus.[2][3][4]
