## Biography
Natural Lateral is a London-based nu jazz band formed organically through spontaneous jam sessions at the Lazy Robot Studio in North London over the past few years leading up to their debut release. The four-piece group consists of Aziz Mustafa, Ozan Nidayi, Oli Arlotto, Malte From, and Tim Balasubramaniam, blending rhythmic elements from funk and Latin jazz with syncopated odd meter timings. Their music draws from a diverse range of influences including Azymuth, Soft Machine, Coltrane, and Lonnie Liston Smith, creating a fusion that ventures into new territory while remaining steeped in jazz traditions.[3]

The band released their debut LP *Cogito Ergo Jam* on October 28, 2019, via the Social Joy label, marking their entry into the nu jazz scene with the single 'Bossa Blue'. They followed with a second album, *Tapestry of Life*, which features transcendental elements like sax and flute contributions from Tamar Osborn's project Collocutor, emphasizing a studio ethos of creative freedom. Natural Lateral's work ethic and jam-session origins have positioned them as an emerging act in the London jazz underground, with low mainstream popularity (Spotify rating of 4) but growing recognition among niche audiences.[3][4][6][7]

While still developing their career, Natural Lateral continues to release music through Social Joy Records, showcasing their open-minded approach to jazz fusion. Their discography reflects a progression from debut explorations to more expansive, collaborative soundscapes, contributing to the vibrant nu jazz landscape without a defined legacy yet established.
