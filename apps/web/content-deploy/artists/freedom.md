## Biography
Freedom Church, a worship music collective originating from Freedom Church founded by Pastor Gary Snowzell, began its journey when Snowzell, at age 21, felt called to pioneer a church in his hometown. Over nearly 30 years, the church expanded from one location to nine, growing steadily for the first 15 years before adopting a regional, national, and international vision under Snowzell's leadership. This growth fostered a new, raw, innovative, and passionate worship sound that emerged from within the church.[1][5][8]

The musical arm, known as Freedom Worship or Freedom Church music team, released its first EP, *Courage and Fire*, in 2009, followed by the live album *Everything Changes* in 2013. In 2015, inspired by a divine call to an 'Uncharted' season, they produced the project *Uncharted*, emphasizing faith, surrender, and stepping into the unknown. The band is described as a diverse collective of musicians from varied ethnicities, influences, and backgrounds, united to create authentic worship music aimed at drawing people to God, particularly in Philadelphia.[1][5][6]

Based in locations including Moncks Corner, SC, and Philadelphia, Freedom Worship continues to develop its unique sound, blending personal experiences into a collective expression that advances God's kingdom through worship.[5][6]
