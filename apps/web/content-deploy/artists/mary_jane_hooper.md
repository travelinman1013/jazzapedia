## Biography
Sena Fletcher, known professionally as Mary Jane Hooper, emerged from New Orleans' vibrant music scene as a gospel singer in Baptist churches before transitioning to secular R&B in the mid-1960s. As a teenager, she auditioned for producer Allen Toussaint, who recognized her talent and hired her for the vocal trio Triple Souls, backing artists like Lee Dorsey on sessions and tours. Renamed Mary Jane Hooper by producer Eddie Bo, she signed to his Scram label in 1966, debuting with 'Don't Change Nothin',' and later moved to his Power and Power Pac imprints, releasing key singles including 'That's How Strong Love Is' in 1968, which was licensed nationally by World Pacific.[1][2][3]

## Fun Facts
- Her name 'Mary Jane Hooper' was given to her by producer Eddie Bo, and many speculated it was an alias for Inez Cheatham due to vocal similarities, though Bo disputed this.[1]
- She recorded a funky cover of Jeannie C. Riley's country hit 'Harper Valley PTA' with an uptempo arrangement by Eddie Bo.[2]
- Jerry Wexler of Atlantic Records nearly signed her after hearing 'Teach Me,' but negotiations failed over contract terms with manager Al Scramuzza.[2]
- Most of her best studio performances, like 'Don't Change Nothin'' and 'Psychedelphia,' remained unreleased until the 1997 CD compilation Teach Me (later reissued as Psychedelphia).[2]
