## Biography
Little Feat is an American rock band formed in 1969 in Los Angeles, California, after Frank Zappa fired vocalist and guitarist Lowell George from the Mothers of Invention and encouraged him to start his own group. George recruited keyboardist Bill Payne, drummer Richie Hayward, and bassist Roy Estrada (also a Zappa alumnus), leading to a quick signing with Warner Bros. Records. Their debut album *Little Feat* (1971) featured the classic 'Willin',' while *Sailin' Shoes* (1972) expanded their sound with tracks like 'Easy to Slip' and a re-recorded 'Willin'.' The lineup stabilized with the addition of guitarist Paul Barrere, bassist Kenny Gradney, and percussionist Sam Clayton, producing landmark albums such as *Dixie Chicken* (1973), *Feats Don't Fail Me Now* (1974), and the legendary live recording *Waiting for Columbus* (1978), blending southern rock, funk, jazz, country, and New Orleans boogie into a distinctive jam band style.[1][2][3]

Tragedy struck in 1979 when founder Lowell George died during the recording of *Thanks, I'll Eat It Here*, causing the band to disband temporarily. Bill Payne and Paul Barrere reunited in 1987, reforming with Craig Fuller on vocals, Fred Tackett on guitar, and the enduring rhythm section of Gradney and Clayton. Albums like *Let It Roll* (1988) and *Representing the Mambo* (1990) marked their comeback, with Shaun Murphy later joining as vocalist until 2009. The band has continued touring and releasing live recordings via their Hot Tomato Records label, showcasing resilience through lineup changes including recent additions like guitarist Scott Sharrard and drummer Tony Leone.[1][3][4]

Little Feat's legacy endures as live performance legends, known for their improvisational prowess and soulful, groove-heavy music that has influenced jam bands and southern rock acts. With a career spanning over five decades, they remain active, captivating audiences with classics and new energy, embodying survival and creativity in rock music.[3]
