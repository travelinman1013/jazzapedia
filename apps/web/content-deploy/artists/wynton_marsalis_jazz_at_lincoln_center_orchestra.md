## Biography
The Wynton Marsalis Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra (JLCO) is a world-class big band ensemble founded in 1987 as part of Wynton Marsalis's efforts to promote jazz at Lincoln Center in New York City. Initially launched as a summer concert series, it evolved into a full department by 1996 and an independent entity, performing at the state-of-the-art Frederick P. Rose Hall, which opened in 2004 as the world's first dedicated jazz performance space. Under Marsalis's leadership as artistic and managing director, the JLCO has toured globally, released albums on its Blue Engine Records label, and engaged in extensive educational outreach, embodying genres like big band, jazz, and Latin jazz.[2][3]
