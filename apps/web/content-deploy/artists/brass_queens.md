## Biography
Brass Queens is a female-led, all-female brass band formed in Brooklyn, New York, in March 2019 by co-founders Alex Harris (trumpet) and Ally Chapel (alto sax), who met through community bands and shared frustrations over the male-dominated New York brass band scene. Motivated to increase visibility for female musicians, they recruited a core lineup including Stephanie King and Minerva Johnson (trumpets), Jenna Murdoch (tenor sax), Stephanie Young (trombone), Nora Nalepka (sousaphone), Ashley Baier (drums), and Caitlin Crawley (percussion), later expanding to 10 members. Starting with small gigs like birthdays, weddings, and street performances in Brooklyn, the band quickly built a reputation, earning the nickname 'the hardest working band in town' from peers and getting scouted by an artist management company after venue shows.[1][2][3][4]

Their musical style draws deeply from the New Orleans jazz tradition, particularly modern brass bands like Rebirth Brass Band and The Soul Rebels, blended with influences from mambo, balkan music, pop, classic rock, and film scores. Key releases include their debut EP 'Royal Street' in February 2021 (featuring covers like Cameo's 'Candy' and 'Little Liza Jane'), the full-length 'Black & Gold' in November 2023 (honoring early fans from pandemic-era virtual and street performances), and 'Hot Tub Sessions Vol. I' (their first all-original album, inspired by touring experiences). They've performed at high-profile events like the Met Gala, Carnegie Hall, New York City Pride, Governors Ball Music Festival, Good Morning America, and festivals including Telluride Jazz Festival, Ottawa Jazz Festival, and MusikFest, while touring nationally and internationally.[1][2][3][4][6]

Brass Queens has redefined the brass band landscape by prioritizing female representation, enforcing a black-and-gold dress code inspired by New Orleans Saints colors and Ally Chapel's time in CU Boulder's Golden Buffalo Marching Band, and winning the 2023 MTA Music Under New York Riders’ Choice Award for subway performances. In 2024, they made history as the first all-female band to lead the NYC Village Halloween Parade. Their rapid rise from local fixtures to global performers underscores their commitment to playing diverse audiences and evolving their sound with original compositions.[3][4][6]
