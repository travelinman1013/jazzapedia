## Biography
AfroCuba de Matanzas is a renowned Cuban folkloric group founded in 1957 in Matanzas, a city celebrated as one of the cradles of Afro-Cuban folklore where centuries-old African traditions have been preserved in their purest forms.[2][3][8] Led by founder and director Francisco 'Minini' Zamora Chirino until his passing in June 2016, the group specializes in performing music, dance, and percussion from diverse African origins including Lucumí (Yoruba), Arará (Dahomey), Bantu (Congo), and Carabali, alongside Spanish and Caribbean-influenced styles such as rumba variants like yambú, guaguancó, and columbia.[3][8] Many members hail from the Villamil family, descended from Oyo musicians kidnapped in the 1880s, one of whom was a babalawo and Omo Oggun, embedding deep Yoruba and Congo ancestral roots within the ensemble.[3]

The group's repertoire offers a comprehensive panorama of traditions brought by African slaves to Cuba, evolved and integrated into modern society, with performances featuring dramatic rituals like the Bricamo cleansing dance, Abakuá masked dancers, and a 1991 'Bata opera' based on Yoruba goddess Oya.[3] AfroCuba de Matanzas has toured extensively worldwide, captivating audiences in Angola, Zaire, Finland, Italy, Brazil, England, and the United States, including a standout appearance at the 1989 Smithsonian Folklife Festival in Washington, D.C.[3] After Minini's death, his wife Sara 'Mima' Gobel assumed directorship, continuing the mission to preserve ancestral legacies while enriching them through creative interpretation amid the challenges of the Cuban revolution.[2][3]

Matanzas' cultural significance as the 'Athens of Cuba' underscores the group's role in sustaining Afro-Cuban heritage, with a 57-year history by the time of recent documentaries highlighting their struggles, victories, and deep roots in rumba and percussion traditions.[2][3]
