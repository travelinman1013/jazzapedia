## Biography
No comprehensive biographical information on a musical artist or group named 'Grupo Folia' was found in credible sources. Search results primarily reference 'La Folia' (also spelled Folía or Follia), a historical European musical theme and chord progression originating from Portuguese folk music in the late 15th century, not a modern band[1][3][4]. This theme evolved into a Baroque staple used for variations by composers like Corelli, Vivaldi, and others, influencing music across Europe and Scandinavia[3][8][9].

The Spotify context lists genres such as cumbia norteña, norteño, tejano, and grupera with popularity 31, suggesting a regional Mexican or Tex-Mex group, but no matching biographical details, members, or discography appear in the provided results or verifiable sources[5]. Without specific documentation on formation, career milestones, or key releases, a detailed biography cannot be constructed.

'La Folia' itself has a rich legacy as one of the oldest remembered European themes, spreading from Portugal to Spain, Italy, and beyond, adapted in folk, court, and classical contexts, but it is not associated with a contemporary 'Grupo Folia'[2][3][7].
