## Biography
The Funkees were a pioneering Nigerian Afro-rock band formed in the late 1960s in Eastern Nigeria, emerging from the post-Nigerian Civil War era (ending 1970) as an army band in Aba. Founded by guitarist and lead singer Harry Mosco, the group initially performed covers of Western artists like the Beatles, Fela Kuti, Aretha Franklin, Rolling Stones, and Elvis Presley, while quickly gaining fame for their electrifying live shows sung in Igbo and English that matched the energy of Lagos acts like MonoMono and BLO[1][2][3]. Blending **afrobeat**, **highlife**, funk, and rock with gritty guitar riffs, robust polyrhythms, and bilingual lyrics, they created a danceable sound that kept Eastern Nigeria's dance floors alive[1][3][5].

In 1973, The Funkees relocated to London, where their fierce performances opened for international acts like Kool & The Gang, Osibisa, and Fatback Band, earning acclaim among West African and Caribbean expatriates[2][3]. They released two landmark studio albums: *Point of No Return* (1974), featuring gritty Afrobeat cuts, and *Now I’m A Man* (1976), which leaned into funk-rock with tracks like the title empowerment jam and the prog-infused instrumental '303'[2][3]. Core members included Harry Mosco (guitar/vocals), Chyke Madu (drums/vocals), Jake N. Sollo (guitar/organ/vocals), Mohammed Ahidjo (vocals/percussion), and Sonny Akpabio (congas)[3].

The band's legacy endures through rediscovery via compilations like *Dancing Time: The Best of Eastern Nigeria's Afro Rock Exponents 1973-77* (2012) and *The World Ends: Afro Rock & Psychedelia in 1970s Nigeria* (2010), influencing future Nigerian artists and inspiring modern dance floors with their optimistic, groove-heavy sound[3][5].
