## Biography
Marie Daulne, the founder and leader of Zap Mama, was born in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (then Zaire) to a Zairean mother and Belgian father. Her early life was marked by dramatic events, including her father's murder by Simba rebels, after which her mother fled with the family into the jungle, living among Pygmy tribes for safety. Raised primarily in Belgium after escaping to Europe, Daulne drew inspiration from the African songs her mother sang and the Pygmy vocal techniques she encountered, blending them with European influences. In the late 1980s, after studying Pygmy music in Africa and singing jazz in Brussels cafes, she formed Zap Mama in 1990 as an all-female a cappella quintet with vocalists including Sabine Kabongo and Sylvie Nawasadio, auditioning dozens to create a unique polyphonic sound fusing African traditions with global elements.[1][2][3][5]

Zap Mama's career launched with their 1993 debut album *Adventures in Afropea I* on David Byrne's Luaka Bop label, which topped Billboard's World Music chart for 11 weeks and became the label's biggest-selling non-compilation album, weaving influences from Zaire, Tanzania, Syria, France, and Spain. Their style evolved from pure a cappella polyphony—described by The New York Times as a 'utopian multicultural dream'—to incorporate hip-hop, neo-soul, jazz, and pop, as heard in later works like *Sabsylma* (1994), which won a Grammy for Best World Music Album and added Indian, Moroccan, and Australian flavors. Daulne left major labels to preserve artistic integrity, collaborated on film soundtracks like *Mission: Impossible II* and *La Haine*, and toured with artists like the Neville Brothers, Al Jarreau, and Bobby McFerrin, performing on shows including Sesame Street and the Arsenio Hall Show.[1][2][3]

Daulne's musical legacy lies in bridging African polyphony and polyrhythms with contemporary genres, influencing hip-hop, nu-soul, and jazz while teaching ethno-vocal therapy and African techniques in Brussels. Now based between the US (Philadelphia and New York) and Belgium, Zap Mama has evolved into a larger ensemble since 2002's *7*, maintaining a commitment to cultural preservation—such as using Coca-Cola commercial earnings to fund a school in Africa—and global unity through voice.[1][2][3][4]

## Fun Facts
- Zap Mama used earnings from a Coca-Cola commercial to build a school in Africa, aligning with their cultural preservation mission.[3]
- Daulne left a major label at their peak after *Adventures in Afropea I*'s success, rejecting a 'French poppy girl group' direction to stay true to bringing 'music of forgotten people' forward.[2]
- Their song 'Iko-Iko' was featured in *Mission: Impossible II*, and they contributed to *La Haine*'s soundtrack.[2]
- Originally a quintet, Zap Mama evolved into a seven-person band by 2002's album *7*.[7]
