# ROD STEWART

## Biography
Rod Stewart (born January 10, 1945, in London, England) is a British singer-songwriter whose soulful, raspy voice became iconic in rock and pop music beginning in the late 1960s.[2] After an early interest in folk music and rhythm and blues, Stewart performed with several London-based bands in the mid-1960s, including Steampacket and Shotgun Express, before joining the influential Jeff Beck Group in 1966 alongside guitarist Jeff Beck and future Rolling Stones member Ron Wood.[2][3] His collaboration with Beck ended in 1969 when he joined the Faces (formerly the Small Faces), a blues-rock band that aligned with his long-standing R&B interests, while simultaneously launching his solo career.[2]

Stewart's breakthrough came with his third solo album, Every Picture Tells a Story (1971), which topped charts in the UK, US, Canada, and Australia, establishing him as an international star.[1] His signature hit "Maggie May" from this album became his first major solo success.[3] Throughout the 1970s, he achieved extraordinary commercial success with consecutive chart-topping albums in the UK and top-three placements globally, including A Night on the Town (1976), which featured the US number-one single "Tonight's the Night (Gonna Be Alright)."[1] After exploring disco and new wave in the late 1970s and early 1980s, Stewart transitioned to a soft rock and middle-of-the-road style that dominated his output through the 1990s and 2000s.[1]

In the early 21st century, Stewart shifted focus to interpreting standards and classics, releasing multiple collections of traditional-pop standards beginning in 2002, earning his first Grammy Award in 2004 for Stardust…: The Great American Songbook Volume III.[2] He was knighted in 2016 for services to music and charity and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice—as a solo artist in 1994 and as a member of the Faces in 2012.[1][2] His legacy encompasses 10 number-one UK albums, 31 top-ten UK singles (six reaching number one), and 16 top-ten US singles (four reaching number one), establishing him as one of rock's most enduring and commercially successful artists.[1]
