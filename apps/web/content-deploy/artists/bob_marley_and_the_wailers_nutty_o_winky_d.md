## Biography
Bob Marley & The Wailers were a legendary Jamaican reggae band formed in the late 1960s, led by Bob Marley (1945-1981), who rose from humble beginnings in Nine Mile, Jamaica, to become a global icon of roots reggae, advocating for peace, love, and African unity through hits like 'No Woman, No Cry' and 'One Love.' Their music blended ska, rocksteady, and Rastafarian spirituality, influencing worldwide audiences before Marley's death from cancer in 1981. In a posthumous development, the 2023 album *Africa Unite* reimagines their classics with contemporary African artists, highlighting Marley's enduring legacy in fusion projects.[2][3][5]

Zimbabwean artists Winky D (Wallance Chirumamu, born 1983 in Harare) and Nutty O (Kudakwashe Mhere, born 1993) are prominent figures in Zimdancehall, a reggae-dancehall fusion genre addressing social issues like poverty, corruption, and inequality. Winky D, known as the 'King of Zimdancehall,' has built a career since the early 2000s with albums critiquing societal ills, earning international awards including AFRIMA Best Male Artist (Southern Africa) in 2022 and multiple Best African Dancehall Entertainer honors. Nutty O, emerging in the 2010s, blends Afrobeats and reggae, gaining nominations for AFRIMA Best Artiste in African Reggae/Ragga/Dancehall in 2022.[2][4]

Their collaboration with Bob Marley & The Wailers on *Africa Unite* (released August 4, 2023), produced by DJ Tamuka, features them on the opening track 'So Much Trouble in the World,' infusing AfroDancehall rhythms into Marley's 1979 original to echo ongoing global struggles. This project unites Marley's compositions with artists like Tiwa Savage, Davido, and Patoranking, celebrating reggae's African roots and contemporary relevance in genres like ragga and roots reggae.[1][2][3][5][6]
