## Biography
James Andrews, born January 12, 1969, in New Orleans, Louisiana, grew up in the Tremé neighborhood immersed in music from a young age. Grandson of R&B pioneer Jesse 'Ooh-Poo-Pah-Doo' Hill, who wrote the classic song of the same name and played drums for artists like Professor Longhair and Huey 'Piano' Smith, Andrews was exposed to gospel, R&B, funk, and jazz in his family environment. As a child, he tap danced and shined shoes in the French Quarter before picking up the trumpet, alongside brothers Terry, Bruce, and cousin Leonard, forming early groups that played for tips around Jackson Square. He advanced through brass bands including the Treme Brass Band, Junior Olympia Brass Band, and New Birth Brass Band, while taking music lessons in school to hone his skills.[1][2][4][5]
