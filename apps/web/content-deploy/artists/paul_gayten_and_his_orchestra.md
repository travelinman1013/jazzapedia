## Biography
Paul Leon Gayten (January 29, 1920 – March 26, 1991), also credited as Paul Gayton, was born in Kentwood, Louisiana, as the nephew of blues pianist Little Brother Montgomery. Starting as a teenager, he played piano in local bands and formed his own group, Paul Gayten's Sizzling Six, which included future bebop saxophonist Teddy Edwards. During World War II, he led a band at an Army base in Biloxi, Mississippi, before moving to New Orleans, where his trio gained residency at Club Robin Hood and recorded early R&B hits like 'True (You Don't Love Me)' and 'Since I Fell for You' featuring Annie Laurie in 1947, both reaching the R&B top ten.[1][2][3]
