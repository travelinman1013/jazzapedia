## Biography
Johnny Mathis was born on September 30, 1935, in Gilmer, Texas, and raised in San Francisco, California, as one of seven children in a musical family. His father, Clem Mathis, a former vaudeville performer, encouraged his early interest in music and singing, while Mathis also excelled in high school track and field as a high jumper with Olympic aspirations. At age 13, he began formal vocal training with San Francisco opera teacher Connie Cox, studying for six years to develop classical and operatic skills alongside voice production. In 1954, while singing at the Black Hawk Club, he caught the attention of co-founder Helen Noga, who became his manager and secured him gigs, leading to his discovery by Columbia Records talent scout George Avakian in 1955. Choosing music over the Olympics, Mathis signed with Columbia in late 1955 and relocated to New York, launching his career under producer Mitch Miller with romantic ballads.[2][5][6][9]
