## Biography
Waylon Arnold Jennings was born on June 15, 1937, in Littlefield, Texas, and grew up in a working-class family, dropping out of high school at 16 to pursue music. He began his career in Lubbock, playing bass for Buddy Holly in 1958 and forming early bands, but tragedy struck in 1959 when he gave up his seat on the plane that crashed, killing Holly, Ritchie Valens, and The Big Bopper. After the crash, Jennings worked as a DJ in Lubbock, then moved to Arizona in 1960, forming the rockabilly band the Waylors, which gained a local following and recorded singles for independent labels.[1][2][3][4]

In 1965, Jennings relocated to Nashville, signing with RCA Victor under Chet Atkins and achieving his first country hit with 'Stop the World (And Let Me Off).' Roommates with Johnny Cash, he developed a friendship that influenced his path. By the early 1970s, frustrated with the Nashville sound, Jennings pioneered outlaw country—a grittier, rock-influenced style—releasing seminal albums like *Ladies Love Outlaws* (1972), *Lonesome, On’ry and Mean* (1973), and *Honky Tonk Heroes* (1973). Hits such as 'This Time,' 'I'm a Ramblin' Man,' and 'Luckenbach, Texas' topped charts, and with Willie Nelson, Tompall Glaser, and Jessi Colter (his wife), he recorded country music's first platinum album, *Wanted! The Outlaws* (1976).[1][2][4]

Jennings battled cocaine addiction, overcoming it in 1984, and later joined the Highwaymen supergroup with Nelson, Johnny Cash, and Kris Kristofferson, releasing three albums from 1985 to 1995. His legacy as an outlaw country pioneer endures, with 16 No. 1 country hits and 11 No. 1 albums, though health issues from his hard-living lifestyle led to his death on February 13, 2002.[2][4]
