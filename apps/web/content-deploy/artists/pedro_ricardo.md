## Biography
Pedro Ricardo is a Portuguese multi-instrumentalist, DJ, producer, and musician based in Berlin, renowned for his genre-blending work that fuses traditional Portuguese folk with jazz, electronic elements, Brazilian, Cape Verdean, and Spanish influences. He gained recognition with his debut album *Soprem Bons Ventos* released in 2023 on Soundway Records, an eclectic 9-track project featuring rhythmic guitar, keyboards, cosmic electronics, dynamic drums, and tracks like 'Ode ao Gato' tributing Argentinian saxophonist Gato Barbieri. Known in Porto for his risk-taking DJ sets with organic grooves rooted in jazz, house, and techno, Ricardo's artistry emphasizes fusion, melody, and soulful traditions.[2][3][5]

His career as a producer spans releases on labels like Extended Records, 1980Lyfers, Wolf Music, and his own Pedro’s House, including the 2024 vinyl *PEDRO002* exploring hi-tech jazz and house. In early 2025, he relocated temporarily to Rio de Janeiro, refining songwriting inspired by Portuguese poets like Ary dos Santos and his own lyrics, leading to a double 7-inch EP series in 2026 featuring guest vocals from António Zambujo and Ana Margarida Prado, combined with flutes, strings, and electronic production. Ricardo performs with the Pedro Ricardo Trio, scores live films, and continues to evolve his sound across live and electronic formats.[2][4]

While specific details on his early life remain limited in available sources, Ricardo's work positions him as a forward-thinking artist bridging cultural traditions with modern dance music, earning praise as a 'rising' talent with a 'great calling card' album and ongoing projects that promise further innovation.[3][5]
