## Biography
Phase II Pan Groove is a renowned steelband formed in August 1972 in Woodbrook, Port-of-Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, by a group of innovative young musicians who broke away from the Starlift Steel Orchestra to create a more experimental sound on steelpan. The founding members included Len “Boogsie” Sharpe, Barry Howard, Andy Phillips, Selwyn Tarradath, Noel Seon, Rawle Mitchell, and leader/tuner Michael Phillips. From its inception, the band distinguished itself by performing original compositions arranged by Sharpe, pioneering a bold approach in steelband competitions that prioritized creativity over conventional covers, influenced by earlier innovators like Ray Holman.[1][2][3]

Under Sharpe's leadership as musical director, composer, and virtuoso panist—often hailed as the 'Mozart of Pan'—Phase II achieved groundbreaking success despite initial resistance. The band won its first North Zonal title in 1977 and made history in 1987 as the first unsponsored steelband to claim the national Panorama championship with their own tune 'Feeling Nice' (also referenced as 'This Feeling Nice'), repeating the feat in 1988. They secured additional national titles in 2005, 2006, 2008, 2013, and 2014, rarely finishing outside the top three, while experimenting with groovy dance music, contemporary instruments, and classical influences like in 'Dance of the Douens'.[1][2][3][4][5]

Phase II's legacy endures through extensive international tours across North America, the Caribbean, Europe, South Africa, Japan, and participation in events like Trinidad's 2006 World Cup cultural contingent. Sharpe's global solo performances with jazz legends elevated the band's profile, fostering a diverse, inclusive panyard that integrated women leaders, international players, and innovative creativity, solidifying Phase II as one of Trinidad's 'Big Five' steelbands and a symbol of steelpan evolution.[1][3]

## Fun Facts
- Phase II Pan Groove was named for being the 'Phase II' of the founders' careers after years in other steelbands, with 'Groove' reflecting their focus on danceable music.[1][2]
- In 1987, they became the first unsponsored band and first to win national Panorama with their own original tune 'Feeling Nice', a feat repeated in 1988.[1][4][5]
- Foreign adjudicators dubbed Len “Boogsie” Sharpe the 'Mozart of Pan' at the Steelband Musical Festival for compositions like 'Dance of the Douens' that rivaled classical masters.[1][3]
- The band has so many near-misses in Panorama (e.g., multiple seconds) that players jokingly suggest a plaque for 'most second-place finishes'.[4]
