## Biography
Paul Samuel Whiteman was born on March 28, 1890, in Denver, Colorado, to musically accomplished parents—his mother Efrida was an opera singer and his father Wilberforce J. Whiteman was a respected music teacher.[6] He began his musical training as a classical violinist and violist, earning a place in the Denver Symphony Orchestra by 1907 and later joining the San Francisco Symphony in 1914.[4] During World War I, Whiteman conducted a 12-piece U.S. Navy band at Mare Island Naval Training Camp, gaining valuable experience in orchestral direction.[4] After the war, he formed his first dance orchestra in San Francisco in 1918, initially performing at the Fairmont Hotel.[3]

Whiteman's orchestra rapidly ascended to prominence following his move to New York City in 1920, when he began recording for Victor Records.[1][2] His early recordings, including "Whispering," "Japanese Sandman," and "Wang Wang Blues," became massive commercial successes, establishing him as a household name.[3] Press notices dubbed him the "King of Jazz," a title he wore with pride throughout his career.[2][4] Whiteman's distinctive approach involved blending symphonic music with jazz elements, employing large ensembles of up to 35 musicians—substantially larger than typical dance bands of the era.[5] He was renowned for hiring the most technically skilled musicians available and paying them premium wages, attracting luminaries such as Bix Beiderbecke, Frankie Trumbauer, Bing Crosby, Mildred Bailey, Johnny Mercer, Joe Venuti, and Eddie Lang.[1] His 1924 commissioning and premiere of George Gershwin's "Rhapsody in Blue" became his orchestra's signature piece and a defining moment in American music history.[1][2]

Whiteman's legacy remains complex and contested within jazz historiography. While detractors argue his ornately orchestrated arrangements lacked the improvisational essence and emotional depth of authentic jazz, historians acknowledge his genuine passion for the genre and his efforts to collaborate with Black musicians despite the constraints of racial segregation.[4] He wrote more than 3,000 arrangements and produced over 600 phonograph recordings during his career.[4] Whiteman's symphonic jazz approach made jazz accessible to mainstream American audiences during the 1920s and 1930s, fundamentally shaping public perception of the genre.[1] He was inducted into the Big Band and Jazz Hall of Fame in 1993 and received two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contributions to recording and radio.[4] Whiteman died on December 29, 1967, leaving an indelible mark on American popular music.

- Whiteman led orchestras ranging from 9 to 35 musicians—substantially larger than typical dance bands of the 1920s which consisted of 6 to 10 members—allowing him to create his signature lush, symphonic sound.[5]
