## Biography
Sara and Sean Watkins, siblings from Carlsbad, California, grew up immersed in bluegrass music through the local community Bluegrass ETC, where Sean learned guitar and mandolin from John Moore, and Sara studied violin with Dennis Caplinger. Additional mentors like Dan Clary, John Hickman, and fiddle virtuoso Byron Berline shaped their skills during Saturday night jams at a pizza place called That Pizza Place, where they first met childhood friend Chris Thile. This foundation led to the formation of Nickel Creek in 1989, named after one of Berline's instrumentals, with their debut performance at the same venue alongside Thile's father on bass; the trio gained prominence after Alison Krauss produced their self-titled 2000 album, earning a Grammy nomination, and achieved major success with 2002's *This Side*, blending bluegrass with alternative rock influences to attract a broad audience beyond traditional genres.[1][2][3]

In 2002, encouraged by Largo nightclub owner Mark Flanagan in Los Angeles, Sean and Sara launched the Watkins Family Hour as a collaborative variety show to experiment with original songs and covers unsuitable for Nickel Creek. Initially driving from San Diego, they established it as a hub for roots music innovation at Largo, featuring surprise guests and evolving lineups; after Nickel Creek's 2007 hiatus (with a 2014 reunion), the siblings relocated to L.A.'s Laurel Canyon, building solo careers while sustaining the Hour, which released albums like the self-titled debut and *Vol. II* in 2022, marking 20 years with sold-out shows.[3][4][5]

Their musical style fuses **bluegrass**, **newgrass**, and **Americana**, emphasizing instrumental mastery, innovative songwriting, and genre-transcending collaborations that draw luminaries from rock, folk, and beyond, creating a legacy as community builders in L.A.'s music scene and appealing to diverse listeners who might otherwise skip bluegrass concerts.[1][3]
