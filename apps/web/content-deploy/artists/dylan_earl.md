## Biography
Dylan Earl is a country musician born in Lake Charles, Louisiana in the late 1980s who became a vital voice in socially conscious country music.[1][2] At age 15, following his parents' divorce and displacement by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, he relocated to Arkansas, where he describes finding his "real birth."[2] He attended Subiaco Abbey (a monastic school) and later Hendrix College in Conway, Arkansas, where a monk encouraged him to pursue songwriting after noticing him straying from lesson plans.[3] During his college years around 2009-2010, Earl co-founded the alt-country band Swampbird with drummer Kurt DeLashmet, participating in Conway's vibrant DIY music scene that featured multiple shows nightly across house venues.[2][3]

Earl's musical style blends honky-tonk, southern rock, and traditional country with introspective, poetic lyrics rooted in personal experience and social consciousness.[1] His sonic approach rejects tired Southern stereotypes, instead offering punk-hearted, class-conscious narratives that capture cultural unease with nuance and wit.[3] After college, he moved to Little Rock and later Fayetteville, Arkansas, where he continues to reside, actively touring throughout the United States, England, Norway, and Sweden across venues ranging from DIY generator shows to festivals and house concerts.[1] Earl released his Gar Hole Records debut "I Saw the Arkansas" in March 2023, followed by his fourth studio album "Level-Headed Even Smile" in September 2025, which charts his formative years and offers a refreshingly progressive approach to country music.[1][4]

Throughout his career, Earl has been heavily involved in carving out space for socially conscious country music in the midsouth region alongside contemporaries like Willi Carlisle and Nick Shoulders.[1] His work consistently mines his "shithead years" and early adulthood experiences, transforming personal struggles—including a 2021 possession arrest in Amarillo, Texas—into socially aware commentary on authority, class, and identity.[2] His thesis statement song "Outlaw Country" explicitly rejects authority worship and clarifies his progressive stance against assumptions made based on his appearance and Southern musical tradition.[3]

- He was arrested in Amarillo, Texas in 2021 on a possession charge and wrote the anti-fascist song "Outlaw Country" while "in the belly of the beast, tripping really hard" in jail, later deciding to release it as part of his album after the 2024 election.[2]
- During his college years in Conway, Arkansas, Earl and friends lived at a DIY venue called "Shit Mansion" and participated in the Butt Ranger music festival—a two-day, 28-band event at the White House venue that remains one of his favorite shows.[3]
