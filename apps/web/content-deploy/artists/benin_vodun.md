## Biography
No specific artist named 'Benin Vodun' appears in credible sources as an individual musician, band, or group. The term likely refers to the broader tradition of **vòdún** (Vodun) music from Benin, a spiritual and cultural practice central to Beninese musical history, involving rhythms, percussion, and songs tied to religious ceremonies that have evolved into modern genres[1][2].

Vòdún music originated in precolonial kingdoms where it served as transcultural capital for power consolidation, surviving the slave trade and French colonialism. Post-independence in 1960, it blended with jazz, salsa, funk, highlife, and Afrobeat; under the 1970s Marxist government of Mathieu Kérékou, groups like Orchestre Poly-Rythmo adapted vòdún rhythms with communist themes, while musicians like Ignace de Souza and Sagbohan Danialou transformed traditional styles (e.g., kakagbo, tchinkoumé) into popular music[1][2].

Since the 1990s democratic era and constitutional recognition of vòdún as an official religion, musicians have globalized it through brass bands like Gangbé Brass Band and international tours, increasing its economic and healing value amid postcolonial contexts[1][2]. Modern acts continue fusing it with jazz, rock, and riddim, reflecting Benin's pluralistic heritage[6].

## Fun Facts
- Vòdún music influenced global genres: its rhythms from Benin traveled via the slave trade to form Haitian Vodou and even blues foundations[7].
- Under Kérékou's regime, vòdún bands like Orchestre Poly-Rythmo embedded communist lyrics in traditional rhythms, creating a unique socialist-funk fusion[1][2].
- Gangbé Brass Band's extensive Europe/North America tours helped elevate Benin's vòdún from local ritual to international jazz-brass acclaim[2].
- Benin International Musical reinterprets voodoo origins through rock and rap, tracing modern styles like gospel, blues, and jazz back to Ouidah's slave road convents[6].
