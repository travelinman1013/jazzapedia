## Biography
Edward Simon, born on July 27, 1969, in Punta Cardón, Venezuela, began his musical journey early, moving to the United States at age ten to study at the Performing Arts School in Philadelphia. He later attended the University of the Arts in Philadelphia for classical piano and the Manhattan School of Music for jazz piano, arriving in New York City in 1988. His career took off with his debut album as a leader, *Beauty Within* (1994, AudioQuest), featuring the Edward Simon Trio with Horacio Hernández and Anthony Jackson; that same year, he placed as a finalist in the Thelonious Monk International Jazz Piano Competition.[1][2][3][5]

Simon's style fuses jazz improvisation with Venezuelan folk music, evident in ensembles like Ensemble Venezuela (founded 2003), Sexteto Venezuela, Afinidad Quartet (with Scott Colley and Brian Blade), and Simon, Simon, & Simon with his brothers. He has recorded 11-16 albums as leader, including New York Times Top Ten jazz records *Edward Simon* (1995) and *Simplicitas* (2005), DownBeat's 'Best CD of 2007' *Unicity*, and commissioned suites like *Venezuelan Suite* (2005, Chamber Music America), *Sorrows and Triumphs* (2010), and *House of Numbers* (2010). A core member of SFJAZZ Collective since 2009, he has performed globally at venues like Jazz at Lincoln Center and Berliner Philharmonie, and contributed to over 50 recordings, including Paquito D'Rivera's Grammy-winning *Funk Tango* (2007).[1][2][3][4][5][6]

Based in the San Francisco Bay Area, Simon's legacy includes Guggenheim (2010) and MacDowell (2011) Fellowships, multiple Chamber Music America grants, and teaching roles at New School for Jazz, Western Michigan University, and others. Recognized as 'one of the strongest pianists of his generation' by DownBeat and a 'complete creative artist' by JazzTimes, he mentors via residencies, judging competitions, and private lessons, blending composition, improvisation, and global influences.[1][3][4][6]
