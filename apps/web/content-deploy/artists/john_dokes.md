## Biography
John Dokes, born in Little Rock, Arkansas, and raised in Oakland, California, initially pursued a career in hip-hop and swing dancing, becoming a lindy hop champion before transitioning to singing in his later years. Fascinated by black-and-white reruns of Nat King Cole's 1956 NBC television show and influenced by his father's soul and R&B singing in 1970s Temptations-style groups, Dokes moved to New York City, where he frequented swing dance venues. There, legendary performer Dawn Hampton, his dance partner and mentor, encouraged him to sing professionally after noticing his warm baritone voice while dancing with the George Gee Swing Orchestra[1][3][4].

Dokes joined the George Gee Swing Orchestra as a vocalist around 2005, launching his music career with the 2010 debut album *John Dokes Sings, George Gee Swings*. He released quintet albums *Forever Reasons* (2017) and *True Love* (2019) on the Rondette Jazz label, featuring collaborators like trombonist David Gibson, pianist Steve Einerson, bassist Alex Claffy, and drummer Lawrence Leathers. His style draws from blues-tinged crooners like Joe Williams, Jimmy Rushing, Nat King Cole, Billy Eckstine, and Johnny Mathis, emphasizing pristine articulation, fluid phrasing, and swing for dancers[1][2][3][6]. Personal challenges interrupted progress: Leathers' death in 2019, a move to Chicago with his wife and two daughters in 2021 amid the COVID-19 pandemic, yet he returned to New York for the 2023 nonet album *Our Day*, arranged by Gibson with Gee's band members[1][2].

A CSUN marketing alumnus (1992), Dokes applied his skills to promote his high school dance group and maintains a multifaceted career blending performance, acting training, and songcraft focused on 1940s-1960s jazz standards[1][4].
