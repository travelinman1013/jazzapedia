## Biography
Clifton Chenier (June 25, 1925 – December 12, 1987) was a Creole French-speaking native of Opelousas, Louisiana, who became the pioneering architect of zydeco music. Beginning his career in the 1950s performing near oilfields while working day jobs, Chenier synthesized Cajun music with blues, rhythm and blues, and rock and roll to create a driving, modernized version of zydeco. His influences came not from traditional Cajun musicians but from figures like Fats Domino and Professor Longhair, reflecting the broader divergence between Cajun and Creole musical traditions during this era. After early recordings for Elko Records in 1954 and his first national hit "Ay Tete Fille" on Specialty Records in 1955, Chenier toured extensively with popular R&B performers including Ray Charles, Etta James, Chuck Berry, and Little Richard, establishing himself as a major force in American roots music.

Chenier's career reached its turning point in 1963 when Arhoolie Records producer Chris Strachwitz discovered his early recordings and signed him to the label. Though Chenier and Strachwitz initially differed artistically—with Chenier favoring commercial R&B and Strachwitz encouraging traditional zydeco—their collaboration produced masterpieces including Louisiana Blues and Zydeco, King of the Bayous, and Bon Ton Roulet that introduced zydeco to its widest audience. In 1976, Chenier formed the Red Hot Louisiana Band, featuring tenor saxophonist "Blind" John Hart and guitarist Paul Senegal, and reached peak popularity in the 1980s, receiving a Grammy Award in 1983. A flamboyant performer known for his gold tooth, cape, and crown, Chenier set the standard for all subsequent zydeco musicians and is credited with redesigning the washboard into the vest frottoir, an instrument that could be worn across the shoulders.

Chenier's legacy extends beyond his recordings to his instrumental innovations and his role in elevating zydeco from regional obscurity to national recognition. His son C.J. Chenier joined the Red Hot Louisiana Band as a saxophonist at age 21 and later adopted the band after his father's death in 1987, continuing the zydeco traditions established by his father. Clifton Chenier's explanation of his musical philosophy—"Zydeco is rock and French mixed together"—encapsulates his revolutionary approach to blending traditional Creole music with contemporary American popular music forms.

## Fun Facts
- Chenier was a flamboyant performer known for wearing a gold tooth, cape, and crown during concerts, establishing a distinctive stage presence that became iconic in zydeco music.
- Chenier designed and patented the vest frottoir (washboard), sketching his idea for a metalworker in Port Arthur named Willie Landry, who constructed the first version; this innovation allowed the instrument to be worn across the shoulders rather than held in hands.
- Chenier recorded "Zydeco Sont pas Sale," which became the national anthem of zydeco music, and his 1982 album "I'm Here" won a Grammy Award in 1983.
- Chenier was the first act to perform at Antone's, the now world-renowned blues nightclub on Sixth Street in Austin, Texas, and appeared on the first season of PBS's "Austin City Limits" in 1976.
