## Biography
Maceo Parker was born on February 14, 1943, in Kinston, North Carolina, and picked up the saxophone during his pre-teen years, playing in a band with his brothers.[4] He joined James Brown's band in 1964 as a baritone player, initially hired as part of a package deal when Brown recruited his brother Melvin as drummer.[4] Parker quickly established himself as a valuable member, and his first recordings with Brown—"I Feel Good" and "Out of Sight"—became some of Brown's most famous tracks.[4] Over time, Parker transitioned to tenor saxophone and became a prominent soloist on many of Brown's hit recordings, playing alto, tenor, and baritone saxophones throughout the 1960s and into the 1970s.[1]

In 1970, Parker, his brother Melvin, and several members of Brown's band formed Maceo & All the King's Men, which toured for two years.[2] Throughout the late 1970s and early 1980s, he was a featured player with George Clinton's Parliament-Funkadelic and Bootsy Collins' Rubber Band.[4] After a brief hiatus, he returned to James Brown until the latter's incarceration at the end of the 1980s.[4] Parker's solo career began in earnest in 1990 with his album *Roots Revisited*, which spent 10 weeks at the top of Billboard's Contemporary Jazz Charts.[1][4] His 1992 live album, *Life on Planet Groove*, marked his first collaboration with Dutch saxophonist Candy Dulfer and brought him to the attention of younger audiences worldwide.[1][4]

Since the early 1990s, Parker has toured under his own name and released 11 solo albums.[1] He has performed with diverse artists including Prince, Living Colour, Bryan Ferry, The Red Hot Chili Peppers, and The Dave Matthews Band, earning recognition as one of the most sampled musicians in hip-hop.[3] Parker received numerous accolades, including induction into the North Carolina Music Hall of Fame in October 2011, a Lifetime Achievement Award from Victoires Du Jazz in Paris in July 2012, and The North Carolina Heritage Award in May 2016.[1] He continues to tour extensively, performing at major jazz festivals worldwide and doing as many as 290 concerts a year.[1]
