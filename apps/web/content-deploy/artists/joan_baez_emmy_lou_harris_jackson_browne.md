## Biography
Joan Baez, born Joan Chandos Baez, is an American singer, songwriter, musician, and activist renowned for her contemporary folk music often featuring protest and social justice themes. Emerging in the early to mid-1960s at the forefront of the American roots revival, she introduced audiences to Bob Dylan and influenced artists like Emmylou Harris, Joni Mitchell, and Bonnie Raitt, appearing on the cover of Time Magazine in 1962. Baez's career intertwined music with activism, marching for civil rights, opposing the Vietnam War, and supporting figures like Vaclav Havel; she performed at Woodstock in 1969, boosting her profile via the documentary film.[3][1]

Emmylou Harris, a 12-time Grammy winner and Country Music Hall of Fame inductee (2008), began as a country music fan inspired by Baez, picking up the guitar due to her dominance in 1960s folk and activism scenes. Harris's career spans over 40 years with more than 25 albums, evolving toward country-rock influences partly through Baez's direction on David's Album, and collaborations with countless artists.[1][3][4]

Jackson Browne, inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (2004) and Songwriters Hall of Fame (2007), crafts literate songs charged with honesty, emotion, and personal politics. He shares musical paths with Baez and Harris through joint performances, covers, and inductions, including inducting Baez into the Rock Hall in 2017 and benefit shows together.[1][2]
