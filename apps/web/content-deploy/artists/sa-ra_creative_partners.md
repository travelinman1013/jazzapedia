## Biography
Sa-Ra Creative Partners is an American musical group from Los Angeles composed of Om'Mas Keith, Taz Arnold, and Shafiq Husayn.[1] The group's name translates to "the children of God" or "offspring of the most powerful energy in the universe," with the name and creative approach serving as an homage to jazz composer Sun Ra.[1][2] Formed formally in 2000-2001, Sa-Ra emerged from a trio of established industry producers and musicians who had already built substantial credentials before uniting.[2][3] Each member brought distinct expertise: Shafiq Husayn had produced with Ice-T and Lord Finesse in the South Bronx; Om'Mas Keith had worked as a mixer and engineer for artists including Ice-T, Foxy Brown, and Mobb Deep in New York; and Taz Arnold brought his street sensibility and visionary approach from South Central Los Angeles.[2][3]

Sa-Ra quickly became known as a "super-producing unit" and the hip-hop industry's best-kept secret, creating music that defied easy categorization.[1][3] Their work has been described as progressive soul, neo funk, and alternative hip hop, positioning them at the forefront of the future soul movement in the early 2000s.[1][4] The group's production and creative work extended across multiple genres and artist collaborations, including work with Jurassic 5, Pharoahe Monch, Dr. Dre, Kanye West, John Legend, and others.[1][2] In 2009, they released "The Hollywood Recordings" on Babygrande Records, which the group described as their complete vision encompassing more than just music.[2] Sa-Ra's philosophy emphasizes eclecticism, drawing from the best elements of various belief systems, sciences, and practices to develop what Om'Mas Keith described as a "master blueprint" refined over nearly two decades.[2]

Beyond their role as producers and musicians, Sa-Ra members function as executives and creative visionaries, constantly seeking new talent and reinventing their sound while maintaining connection to spiritual and artistic principles.[3] Their work is characterized by what they describe as "Afro Magnetic Electronic Spiritualism," creating music intended to connect with listeners' souls and inner selves.[2] The group's influence on neo-soul and alternative hip-hop production remains significant, though they have maintained a relatively underground profile compared to their mainstream collaborators.

## Fun Facts
- The group's name has multiple spiritual meanings: it translates to 'the children of God,' 'offspring of the most powerful energy in the universe,' and 'children of the cosmos,' reflecting their philosophical approach to music-making.[2]
- Om'Mas Keith's father had approximately 5,000 jazz and soul records in his living room, which heavily influenced Om'Mas's early musical development and production style before he began hands-on production at age 17.[3]
- Sa-Ra members describe their creative philosophy as 'Afro Magnetic Electronic Spiritualism' and emphasize that their work is created 'for the universe' rather than simply for commercial purposes, reflecting their belief that music should connect to listeners' souls and inner beings.[2]
- Despite being signed to Kanye West's G.O.O.D. Music imprint for over 2 years and working with major mainstream artists like Dr. Dre, John Legend, and Kanye West, Sa-Ra maintained their status as the 'hip-hop industry's best-kept secret,' remaining relatively underground compared to their high-profile collaborators.[2][3]
