## Biography
José Luis Feliciano Vega, known as Cheo Feliciano, was born on July 3, 1935, in Ponce, Puerto Rico. Influenced early by bolero music from Trio Los Panchos, he formed his first group, El Combo Las Latas, at age eight, using cans as instruments due to poverty. He studied percussion at the Escuela Libre de Música Juan Morel Campos in Ponce, then moved to New York City's Spanish Harlem in 1952 with his family. Starting as a percussionist with bands like Ciro Rimac's Review, Tito Rodríguez's orchestra, and others, he transitioned to vocals on Tito Rodríguez's recommendation, debuting professionally with the Joe Cuba Sextet on October 5, 1957, singing 'Perfidia.' His rare baritone voice and improvisational wit made him a standout in salsa.[1][2][3][6]

Feliciano remained with Joe Cuba for a decade until 1967, then joined Eddie Palmieri's orchestra, but heroin addiction interrupted his career around 1969. After rehabilitation, he became a prominent anti-drug advocate. Relaunching in 1972 with his solo album *Cheo* on Vaya Records (a Fania subsidiary), featuring Tite Curet compositions like 'Anacaona' and 'Mi Triste Problema,' it broke sales records. He recorded 15 albums for Fania in the 1970s, including hits like 'Amada Mia,' 'Juan Albañil,' and bolero album *La Voz Sensual de Cheo* in Argentina under Jorge Calandrelli. He participated in the first salsa opera *Hommy* and joined the Fania All-Stars. In 1982, he founded Coche Records, continued releasing albums into the 2000s, and earned a 2008 Latin Grammy for Excellence in Music.[1][2][3][4][6]

Feliciano's style blended salsa sonero prowess with sensual bolero interpretations, earning him acclaim across Latin America, Spain, and Colombia, where he was the first tropical singer at the Amira de la Rosa Theater in 1985. He acted as Roberto Clemente's father in the 1987 musical *Clemente*. He died in a car accident in San Juan on April 17, 2014, at age 78, leaving a legacy as a powerful, versatile voice in salsa and bolero.[1][2][4][6]
