## Biography
Holly Cole, born November 25, 1963, in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, grew up in a musical family where her parents, Leon (a CBC radio broadcaster) and Carolyn (an arts administrator), were amateur musicians, exposing her to classical, pop, country, and jazz influences like Nina Simone, Betty Carter, and Sarah Vaughan. After high school, a visit to her brother Allen at Berklee College of Music in Boston ignited her passion for jazz, leading her to move to Toronto in the early 1980s. She briefly studied voice at Humber College but soon began performing in local clubs, where her smoky, distinctive voice and unconventional song choices—from jazz standards to Tom Waits and Lyle Lovett—captivated audiences.[1][2][3][6]

In 1985 or 1986, Cole formed the Holly Cole Trio with pianist Aaron Davis and bassist David Piltch, debuting at Toronto's Stage Door Cafe and building a cult following. Their debut EP *Christmas Blues* (1989) and album *Girl Talk* (1990) went gold in Canada, followed by *Blame It on My Youth* (1992), which achieved platinum status and topped charts in Japan. The trio's breakthrough *Don't Smoke in Bed* (1993) won a Juno Award for Best Contemporary Jazz Album and Japan's Grand Prix awards. Transitioning to a solo career, Cole released *Temptation* (1995, all Tom Waits songs), *Shade* (2003, Juno for Best Vocal Jazz Album), and others blending jazz, pop, and standards, earning multi-platinum sales, two Junos, two Geminis, the Ella Fitzgerald Award, and an honorary doctorate from Queen's University in 2014.[1][2][3][4][5][6]

Cole's musical style is defined by her sultry, smoky vocals, smart arrangements, and reshaping of jazz, pop, country standards, and the New American Songbook (e.g., Burt Bacharach, Peggy Lee). Her international success includes hundreds of thousands of records sold in the US, Japan, and Germany, signed to Blue Note for over a decade, and a lasting legacy as a versatile jazz innovator.[3][4][5]
