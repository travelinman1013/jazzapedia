## Biography
Les Amis Creole was a short-lived but influential Creole music ensemble formed in the mid-2000s in south Louisiana, centered around the collaboration of young fiddler Cedric Watson and veteran musicians Ed Poullard and J.B. Adams (also referred to as James Adams). The group emerged as Cedric Watson, originally from San Felipe, Texas, relocated to south Louisiana around 2003 after his early performances in Houston's zydeco scene, immersing himself in French Creole traditions. Ed Poullard, born in 1952 in Eunice, Louisiana, and later raised in east Texas, brought decades of experience, having apprenticed under legendary Creole fiddler Canray Fontenot and transitioned from accordion to fiddle.[1][2][3]
