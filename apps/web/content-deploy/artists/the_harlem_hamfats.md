## Biography
The Harlem Hamfats were a Chicago-based jazz and blues band formed in 1936 by record producer J. Mayo Williams, despite their name suggesting a New York origin; none of the members were from Harlem, and they were assembled specifically for studio recordings at Decca Records. Initially providing backup for singers like Johnny Temple, Rosetta Howard, and Frankie 'Half-Pint' Jaxon, their debut single 'Oh! Red' became a major hit in April 1936, leading to a contract for 50 titles and a successful career in danceable music blending blues, Dixieland, and swing jazz. Key members included brothers Kansas Joe McCoy (guitar, vocals) and Papa Charlie McCoy (guitar, mandolin) from Mississippi, Herb Morand (trumpet, vocals) and John Lindsay (bass) from New Orleans, Odell Rand (clarinet), Horace Malcolm (piano), and drummers Freddie Flynn and Pearlis Williams from Chicago.[1][2][5]

The band's sound was shaped by the diverse backgrounds of its musicians, with Joe McCoy and Herb Morand as primary songwriters, producing racy, humorous tracks like 'Let's Get Drunk and Truck' and 'If You're a Viper' that addressed themes of sex, drugs, and alcohol. They transitioned from session work to a performing act, recording extensively until around 1939 when Morand returned to New Orleans and shifting musical tastes favored big bands and electric blues, diminishing their commercial appeal. Though not the most innovative, their riff-based small-group style influenced later rhythm and blues, Louis Jordan, and even rock and roll.[1][2][4]

The McCoy brothers, central to the Hamfats, had earlier recorded with Memphis Minnie (Joe's wife), co-writing 'When the Levee Breaks,' later adapted by Led Zeppelin. Both died impoverished in 1950—Joe of heart disease at 44 and Charlie of paralytic brain disease at 41—and were buried in unmarked graves at Restvale Cemetery in Alsip, Illinois, until efforts were made to erect headstones.[2]

## Fun Facts
- Despite the name 'Harlem Hamfats,' the band was entirely Chicago-based with no members from New York; the name was chosen to appeal to New York's larger Black market.[1][2][7]
- They may be the first band assembled purely for studio recordings by producer J. Mayo Williams, pioneering the studio musician group model.[1][4]
- Band members Joe and Papa Charlie McCoy died paupers in 1950 and were buried in unmarked graves until fundraising efforts for headstones.[2][6]
- 'Oh! Red' was widely covered by artists including Count Basie, Ink Spots, Blind Willie McTell, Howlin' Wolf, and Western swing bands.[1]
