## Biography
Seedhe Maut is a hip hop duo from Delhi, India, originally from Uttarakhand, consisting of Siddhant Sharma (stage name Calm) from Nainital and Abhijay Negi (stage name Encore ABJ) from Pauri Garhwal.[1] Formed in 2015, the duo met at Spit Dope Inc., a Delhi underground battle rap league organized by MC Kode and Encore ABJ at Deer Park, Hauz Khas Village, where Calm delivered a freestyle that captured ABJ's attention.[1] Their name derives from slang used by Calm's brother to signify "giving their full potential to something."[1] After competing in various rap battles and cyphers together, they released "Seedhe Maut Anthem" as their first song and lead single for their debut project, *2 Ka Pahada*, entirely produced by veteran producer Sez on the Beat.[1] In 2017, they signed to the independent music label Azadi Records, alongside fellow artist Prabh Deep.[1]

Seedhе Maut rose to prominence through their distinctive style of rapping in Hindi and Haryanvi, delivering knife-sharp, combative rhymes that tackle social issues.[2] Their breakthrough came with their debut album *Bayaan* (2018), produced by Sez on the Beat, which received critical acclaim.[1] Calm, who previously rapped in English, switched to Hindi after collaborating with Prabh Deep on "Class Sikh Maut Vol.2."[1] The duo continued their success with the mixtape *न* (2021), featuring the commercially successful "Nanchaku" with MC Stan, followed by their sophomore album *Nayaab* (2022).[1] They shifted toward a more mainstream sound with their star-studded mixtape *Lunch Break* (2023), which featured collaborations with KRSNA, Faris Shafi, Rawal, Yungsta, Sonnyjim, Badshah, and others, with tracks like "Khatta Flow", "11K", "Asal G", and "Luka Chuppi" achieving significant media coverage.[1]

After departing from Azadi Records in 2024, Seedhe Maut founded their own independent label, DL91, marking a new chapter in their career.[1] In 2025, they released their first compilation album, *DL91 FM*, through DL91 Era, featuring various label artists and comedian Samay Raina, with production by Hurricane rather than their longtime collaborator Sez on the Beat.[1] The duo has established themselves as influential figures in Indian hip-hop, known for their socially conscious lyrics and commitment to representing working-class struggles through their music.
