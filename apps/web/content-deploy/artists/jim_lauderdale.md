## Biography
James Russell Lauderdale, born April 11, 1957, in Due West, South Carolina, grew up in a musical family where both parents were singers. He began his musical journey early, learning drums at age 11, harmonica at 13, and banjo at 15, heavily influenced by Ralph Stanley and bluegrass music. As a teenager, he played bluegrass, Grateful Dead, and folk in a duo with friend Nathan Lajoie. After college, he briefly tried Nashville in 1979, recording with mandolinist Roland White, before moving to New York City to join Floyd Domino's band and later Buddy Miller's band in the emerging twang scene.[1][2]

Lauderdale's career gained momentum in the late 1980s after joining the touring production of Pump Boys and Dinettes, leading to connections in Los Angeles with artists like Rosie Flores, Lucinda Williams, and producer Pete Anderson. He secured publishing deals, released his debut solo album Planet of Love in 1991 produced by Rodney Crowell, and shifted between LA and Nashville. Known for his versatility across country, bluegrass, Americana, and roots music, he has released over 31 studio albums since 1986, including collaborations like Lost in the Lonesome Pines with Ralph Stanley (2002 Grammy winner) and The Bluegrass Diaries (2008 Grammy winner). In 2013, he founded Sky Crunch Records for creative control, later signing with Yep Roc in 2018.[1][3]

Dubbed a 'songwriter's songwriter,' Lauderdale's compositions have been recorded by George Strait, Elvis Costello, the Dixie Chicks, Vince Gill, Patty Loveless, and others. His legacy spans decades, paving the way for Americana with cross-genre work, two Grammy Awards, and roles as sideman, collaborator, and ambassador for North Carolina music, hosting series like Tar Heel Troubadours.[2][5]
