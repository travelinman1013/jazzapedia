## Biography
Trio Matamoros was founded on May 8, 1925, in Santiago de Cuba, Oriente province, Cuba, coinciding with the 31st birthday of its leader, Miguel Matamoros (1894-1971), a prolific guitarist, singer, and composer. The group originated from a spontaneous jam session at Matamoros' birthday celebration, where renowned guitarist Rafael Cueto (1900-1991) invited Siro Rodríguez (1899-1981), a baritone vocalist and maracas player, to join. All three members were singers and composers who revolutionized Cuban music by blending **son cubano** and **bolero** into the innovative 'bolero-son' style, characterized by rich vocal harmonies, complex arrangements, and stronger rhythms. Initially called Trío Oriental, they quickly gained fame with hits like 'El que siembra su maíz,' 'Lágrimas negras,' 'Mamá, son de la loma,' 'La Mujer de Antonio,' and 'Promesa,' penned mostly by Matamoros (over 250 works), with contributions from Siro (35) and Cueto (16).[1][2][3][6]

The trio's career spanned nearly four decades, evolving from a tight-knit unit to larger formats like sextet, septet, conjunto, and orchestra to adapt to trends, while maintaining their signature sound rooted in eastern Cuban traditions. They toured extensively across Latin America (Mexico 1929, Dominican Republic 1930, Venezuela, Panama, Curazao, Puerto Rico, Colombia 1933), Europe, and the United States (first in 1928 for RCA Victor recordings in New York, final in 1960), recording prolifically and influencing Afro-Caribbean music in the 1920s-1930s. In the 1940s, as Matamoros faced voice issues, they incorporated larger ensembles like Conjunto Matamoros and recruited singers, including Beny Moré. The original trio remained active together for 35 years until disbanding around 1960-1969 upon returning to Cuba.[1][2][3][5]

Renowned for their vocal harmony, poetic lyrics, and fingerpicked guitar nuances—Matamoros on lead guitar and vocals, Siro's baritone harmonies, Cueto's strumming and choruses—their 143 sones and 54 boleros captured Cuba's essence, achieving planetary popularity across social strata. Their legacy endures as a cornerstone of Cuban trova and popular music, with recordings still cherished today.[1][2][3]
