## Biography
Shandi Sinnamon, born Shandra Sinnamon in 1954 to a Huguenot family in Miami, Florida, dropped out of high school and moved to Big Sur, California, pursuing her dream of becoming a singer and songwriter. After a bicycle accident prompted her return to Florida for recovery, she studied music and drama at a community college. While performing at a local restaurant, a disc jockey discovered her talent and connected her with Elektra/Asylum Records, leading to her debut album *Shandi Sinnamon* in 1976.

In Los Angeles, producer Mike Chapman signed her to Dreamland Records, releasing her second album *Shandi* in 1980, which he produced under the alias Commander Chapman. She gained prominence writing and performing songs for films and TV, including 'He's a Dream' for *Flashdance* (1983, earning a Grammy for the soundtrack), 'Tough Love' for *The Karate Kid*, 'Fight To Survive' for *Bloodsport*, and the theme for *Charles in Charge* (1984-1987). Her name inspired KISS's song 'Shandi' (1980). Tracks like 'Making It' became hits in Japan, and she contributed to *Sailor Moon*.

Sinnamon worked as a background vocalist for artists including Todd Rundgren, Bernadette Peters, Hoyt Axton, and Johnny Halliday. She now resides in Eugene, Oregon, continuing her career in music for media.
