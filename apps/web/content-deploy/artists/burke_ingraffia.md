## Biography
Burke Ingraffia is a singer-songwriter born and raised in New Orleans, Louisiana, where he developed a unique musical style blending jazz with folky acoustic guitar and distinctive vocals. Described as having a rare lyrical gift in the Southern style reminiscent of Mose Allison or Bob Dorough, he grew up immersed in the city's rich musical heritage before expanding his career regionally and beyond.[1][2] A longtime camper and counselor at Camp High Rocks, Ingraffia balanced early creative pursuits with diverse interests, eventually pursuing parallel careers in music and technology as a software developer.[5]

Ingraffia's career gained recognition through accolades such as being a 2012 Kerrville New Folk Finalist at the Kerrville Folk Festival and winning awards from the Mid-Atlantic Song Contest in both jazz/blues and folk categories.[1][3] His 2020 album *Waves* earned critical acclaim, featuring top New Orleans musicians like drummer Johnny Vidacovich, bassist James Singleton, and keyboardist John Gros, and produced by multi-Grammy winner Scott Billington, known for work with Clarence “Gatemouth” Brown, Professor Longhair, and Bobby Rush.[1] Critics have praised his music for its sincerity, playfulness, and disarming kindness, calling him a 'Renaissance Man' and an 'anomaly' who keeps his serious craft light-hearted.[1]

As owner of Point Clear Media, Ingraffia also explores multi-genre songwriting under the project Saintsonic, showcasing his versatility across styles.[4] His work continues to reflect Southern roots with jazzy folk influences, maintaining a low-key presence with niche popularity.
