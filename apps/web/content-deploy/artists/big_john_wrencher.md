## Biography
Big John Wrencher (February 12, 1923 – July 15, 1977), born John Thomas Wrencher in Sunflower, Mississippi, was an American blues harmonica player and singer who became a defining figure of Chicago's Maxwell Street blues scene. Also known as "One Arm John," Wrencher taught himself harmonica as a child and began his career in the early 1940s as an itinerant musician, traveling through Tennessee, Missouri, Indiana, and Illinois before settling in Chicago by the mid-1940s. There he performed at Maxwell Street Market and house parties alongside blues pioneers like Jimmy Rogers and Claude "Blue Smitty" Smith, establishing himself as a skilled harmonica player and vocalist.

Wrencher's career took a dramatic turn in 1958 when he lost his left arm in a car accident outside Memphis, Tennessee. Despite this profound physical challenge, he continued performing and by the early 1960s had become a fixture at Chicago's Maxwell Street Market, regularly playing from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Sundays. His most celebrated work, the 1969 album *Maxwell Street Alley Blues* (recorded for Barrelhouse Records with guitarist Little Buddy Thomas and drummer Playboy Vinson), was described as "superlative in every regard" by music critic Cub Koda. Wrencher's influence extended internationally through tours with the Chicago Blues Festival in 1973 and the American Blues Legends in 1974, during which he recorded *Big John's Boogie* in London for Big Bear Records with guitarist Eddie Taylor. He remained active until his death from a heart attack in Clarksdale, Mississippi, in July 1977.
