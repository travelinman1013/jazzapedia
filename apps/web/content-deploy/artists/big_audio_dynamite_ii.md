## Biography
Big Audio Dynamite II was the reconfigured incarnation of the English band Big Audio Dynamite (BAD), formed in London in 1984 by Mick Jones, former lead guitarist and co-lead vocalist of The Clash, after his dismissal from that group in 1983. Following the departure of original members Don Letts, Leo Williams, and Greg Roberts—who briefly formed the band Screaming Target—the lineup shifted for the 1991 album *The Globe*, featuring Jones as the sole original member alongside two guitarists, including Nick Hawkins, keyboardist Andre Shapps (Jones's cousin), and others. The band blended punk rock, dance music, hip-hop, reggae, and funk, earning genres like new wave and alternative dance, with *The Globe* marking their commercial peak via the hit single 'Rush,' which topped the US Modern Rock Tracks and Australian ARIA charts.[1][2][6]

BAD II released *The Globe* in 1991, designed by Shawn Stussy, before reverting to Big Audio for 1994's *Higher Power* with additions like DJ Michael 'Lord Zonka' Custance. By 1995, under the original Big Audio Dynamite name, they issued *F-Punk* on Radioactive Records, their least successful album, leading to a breakup in 1997 after *Entering a New Ride*. A reunion tour occurred in 2011. The band's style evolved from Jones's post-Clash experiments, influencing alternative dance while maintaining an eclectic legacy longer than The Clash itself.[1][2][6]

BAD II's era highlighted Jones's vision as a 'vanity project' allowing genre-mashing without prior band tensions, solidifying BAD's endurance through lineup changes and tours supporting U2.
