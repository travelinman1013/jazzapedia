## Biography
Erma Vernice Franklin (March 13, 1938 – September 7, 2002) was an American gospel and R&B singer born in Shelby, Mississippi, who became best known as the elder sister of Aretha Franklin and the original recording artist of 'Piece of My Heart.'[1][3] Growing up in Detroit, Erma sang with her sisters Aretha and Carolyn in their father Reverend C.L. Franklin's church choir at New Bethel Baptist Church.[1][2] During her teenage years, she formed a rhythm and blues vocal group called the Cleopatrettes while attending Northern High School, which won a statewide singing competition.[1][2] After high school, she toured with her father's gospel group for two years before pursuing higher education at Clark College (now Clark Atlanta University), where she studied business—a decision made at her father's insistence that she complete her education before pursuing a full-time music career.[1][2]

Franklin's recording career began in 1961 when she signed with Epic Records, releasing her debut album 'Her Name Is Erma' in 1962, which featured jazz, pop standards, and R&B tunes.[1][2] Frustrated with Epic's direction for her music, she spent 1961-1966 touring as a featured vocalist with New Orleans R&B legend Lloyd Price.[1] Her breakthrough came in 1967 when she signed with Shout Records and recorded 'Piece of My Heart,' co-written and produced by Bert Berns, which became her first Top Ten R&B hit and earned her a Grammy nomination.[1][3] She also frequently provided backup vocals on her sister Aretha's recordings, most notably on 'Respect.'[2] Following her music career's decline in the mid-1970s, Franklin dedicated twenty-five years to community service, working at the Boysville Holy Cross Community Center in Detroit helping homeless and disadvantaged minority children.[2] She died of lung cancer on September 7, 2002, at age 64.[1][2]

## Fun Facts
- Erma made her singing debut at age five in her father's church in Buffalo, New York.[1]
- Her recording of 'Piece of My Heart' didn't receive major recognition until 1992—25 years after its release—when the jeans company Levi Strauss featured it in a European advertising campaign, catapulting the song into the UK top 10.[1]
- Berry Gordy, founder of Motown Records, actively sought to sign Erma as a female star to launch his label, but her father prevented the recording session at Chess Studios, stopping her early career momentum.[1]
- After leaving the music industry in the mid-1970s, Franklin spent 25 years working at the Boysville Holy Cross Community Center in Detroit, dedicating herself to helping homeless and disadvantaged minority children.[2]
