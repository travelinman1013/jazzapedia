## Biography
The Jumbo Shrimp Jazz Band is a New Orleans-based traditional jazz ensemble founded in 2009 by bandleader, trombonist, and vocalist Colin Myers. The band originated as a street busking group on Royal Street during the summer of 2009, initially consisting of just four musicians playing trombone, banjo, bass, and drums. Myers, who arrived in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, developed the group's foundation on the playful and exuberant chemistry that would become their trademark. The band quickly transitioned from street performances to club residencies, establishing themselves at venues like Fritzel's European Jazz Pub on Bourbon Street and eventually becoming a Thursday night fixture at The Spotted Cat Music Club on Frenchmen Street.

Over more than a decade and a half, the Jumbo Shrimp Jazz Band evolved from a traditional jazz ensemble into what they describe as a "progressive traditional jazz" group. While rooted in New Orleans jazz traditions, the band incorporates an eclectic range of musical styles including early New Orleans R&B, surf rock, funk, gypsy swing, punk, pop, Caribbean music, klezmer, and western swing. The current lineup has remained stable for six years, featuring Colin Myers on trombone and vocals, Mike Fulton on trumpet, Dr. Sick on violin and saw, Russell Welch on guitar, Joshua Gouzy on bass, and Simon Lott on drums. The band is known for their high-energy performances, musical spontaneity, and ability to seamlessly shift between genres while maintaining a distinctly New Orleans sensibility.

The Jumbo Shrimp Jazz Band's appeal lies in their accessibility and danceability, making them popular with audiences seeking fresh interpretations of traditional jazz. They regularly feature guest artists on their recordings and performances, collaborating with musicians who bring additional dimensions to their sound. The band's approach reflects New Orleans' cultural heritage as a city that absorbs and synthesizes music from diverse sources, creating something uniquely their own that delivers traditional music into the contemporary era.

## Fun Facts
- The band learned the Peruvian song 'Malambo #1' by Yma Sumac for rooftop concerts they performed during the COVID-19 pandemic at the house of recently deceased drummer Barry Martyn.
- The band's name is contradictory by design—a 'jumbo shrimp' is an oxymoron, which the band acknowledges as fitting their approach to 'progressive traditional jazz' that blends seemingly incompatible musical styles.
- Colin Myers, the bandleader, arrived in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina and founded the band as a street busking group on Royal Street in the summer of 2009 with just four musicians.
- The band performs regularly on Thursday nights at The Spotted Cat Music Club on Frenchmen Street and has maintained their current lineup for six years, allowing their playful chemistry to solidify into a distinctive musical identity.
