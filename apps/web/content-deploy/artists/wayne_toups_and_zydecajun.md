## Biography
Wayne Toups was born on October 2, 1958, in Lafayette, Louisiana, and grew up in Crowley in a family of rice farmers. He picked up the accordion at age 13, quickly winning local contests, and began recording at J.D. Miller’s studio in Crowley around age 10. Developing his career in the late 1970s, he released his first album, *Wayne Toups and the Crowley Aces*, in Europe, gaining U.S. popularity through festivals like Festivals Acadiens in 1984.[1][2][3]

Toups pioneered **Zydecajun**, fusing Cajun music with zydeco rhythms, R&B, soul, Southern rock, and mainstream elements, often singing in English and French. His breakthrough album *Zydecajun* arrived in 1986 on Mercury/Polygram, followed by hits like *Johnnie Can’t Dance* (1988) and *Blast from the Bayou* (1989). A prolific performer, he appeared on soundtracks for *Steel Magnolias* and *Broken Badges*, backed country stars like Garth Brooks, and earned accolades including Accordionist of the Year (1992) and Song of the Year for 'Late in Life' (1991) from the Cajun French Music Association.[2][3][5]

Toups's legacy includes a 2013 Grammy for Best Regional Roots Album (*The Band Courtbouillon*), inductions into the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame (2010), Gulf Coast Hall of Fame (2011), Cajun French Music Hall of Fame (2011), and Louisiana Blues Hall of Fame. Known as 'The Cajun Springsteen' for his high-energy shows, he remains a commercial Cajun success, touring constantly and advocating for coastal restoration.[1][2][3][4]
