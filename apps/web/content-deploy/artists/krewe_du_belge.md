## Biography
Krewe du Belge is a Brussels-based musical collective formed in 2018, inspired by a transformative trip to New Orleans in February 2017 by founders Vanessa Tanghe and Christophe Mercier. Upon returning, they rallied a diverse group of musician friends—professionals and amateurs of varying ages and origins—to recreate the vibrant, genre-blending jazz they experienced during Mardi Gras, establishing the band as the 'self-proclaimed Belgian company of the Carnival of New Orleans.'[1][4][5] The group performs as a marching band or on stage with 8 to 20 musicians, turning every outing into a celebratory event filled with music, dancing, and cultural exchange, while fostering ongoing connections with New Orleans musicians through annual visits.[1][3]

Their musical style embodies contemporary New Orleans jazz, fusing traditional jazz with funk, RnB, rap, Latin rhythms, and Native American percussion, drawing from icons like Dr. John, Professor Longhair, Louis Armstrong, John Boutté, the Marsalis family, Galactic, Trombone Shorty, and brass bands such as Treme, Hot Eight, Rebirth, and Dirty Dozen.[1] To infuse Belgian identity, they adapt local hits like 'Ça plane pour moi,' 'On a soif,' 'Banana split,' and 'Putain Putain' with a New Orleans groove. In December 2022, they released their debut studio album 'De Bruxelles à New Orleans,' featuring nine original French-language tracks addressing themes like their New Orleans encounter, urban gentrification in Brussels, and cultural magic, which evolved into a full performance show exploring jazz history, Black Indian folklore, rock 'n' roll, funk, and Hurricane Katrina's impact.[1][2]

Krewe du Belge's legacy lies in bridging Brussels and New Orleans cultures, promoting joyful, high-quality music that livens up public spaces. Their latest album 'Dans le Vieux Carré' was recorded in New Orleans' Marigny studio with local musicians, showcasing exceptional talent behind their carnival masks and a unique gumbo of trad-funk with Belgian folklore.[2]
