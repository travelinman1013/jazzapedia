## Biography
Harold Mabern Jr. was born on March 20, 1936, in Memphis, Tennessee, into a vibrant jazz scene that shaped his early musical development. Self-taught by ear, he emulated local pianists like Charles Thomas and Phineas Newborn Jr., and played alongside high school classmates including Frank Strozier, George Coleman, Booker Little, and Charles Lloyd. After high school, he moved to Chicago in 1954, joining Walter Perkins' MJT + 3 band and taking private lessons at the American Conservatory of Music, where he absorbed influences from Ahmad Jamal and Bill Lee. In 1959, he arrived in New York on a cold November evening, quickly auditioning successfully with Harry 'Sweets' Edison at Birdland, launching his professional career.[1][2][4]

Mabern built a prolific sideman career in the 1960s, working with Lionel Hampton's big band (including a European tour), the Art Farmer/Benny Golson Jazztet for 18 months, vocalists like Betty Carter, Johnny Hartman, and Arthur Prysock, and leaders such as Donald Byrd, Roy Haynes, Miles Davis, J.J. Johnson, Lee Morgan, Wes Montgomery, and Sonny Rollins. His style blended hard bop, post-bop, and soul jazz with aggressive blues immersion, percussive single-note lines, thick chord waves, and full keyboard range, earning him the nickname 'Big Hands.' He debuted as a leader with *A Few Miles from Memphis* (1968, Prestige), followed by *Rakin' and Scrapin'*, but spent the 1970s-80s freelancing before a resurgence with *Straight Street* (1989) in Japan. Later trios featured Erik Applegate/Ed Thigpen (1990s), then Nat Reeves/Joe Farnsworth (2000s-2010s), and his core band with Eric Alexander, John Weber, and Farnsworth at Smoke Jazz Club.[1][2][3][4]

A revered educator at William Paterson University from 1981 for over 35 years, Mabern profoundly influenced students and recorded 29+ albums as leader, nearly 100 as sideman, including final Smoke Sessions releases like *The Iron Man: Live at Smoke* (2019). He received the Don Redman Heritage Award in 2010 and remained active until his death from a heart attack on September 17, 2019, at age 83, leaving a legacy as one of the great post-bop pianists with encyclopedic repertoire mastery.[1][2][3]

## Fun Facts
- Arrived in New York on November 21, 1959, during an unusually cold evening and was swept onstage at Birdland, auditioning successfully with Harry 'Sweets' Edison who needed a replacement for Tommy Flanagan.[1][4]
- Earned the nickname 'Big Hands' for his percussive style using the full range of the piano, explaining 'I play from my shoulders, from my whole body.'[2]
- Declined a scholarship to Tennessee State University to move to Chicago with classmate Frank Strozier, but couldn't afford the conservatory and instead gigged in a South Side big band.[2]
- Central figure at Smoke Jazz Club, releasing his last four acclaimed albums there, including the fittingly titled *The Iron Man: Live at Smoke*.[3]
