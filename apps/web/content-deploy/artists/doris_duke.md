## Biography
Doris Duke was born Doris Curry on May 18, 1941, in Sandersville, Georgia[7]. She began her musical journey singing in gospel choirs before moving to New York City around 1963, where she established herself as a session singer and backing vocalist at the legendary Apollo Theatre[4]. During the mid-1960s, she recorded demos for Motown that were never released, and performed backing vocals on Nina Simone's live album A Very Rare Evening, recorded in Germany in 1969[1]. Under her birth name Doris Willingham, she released her debut single "Running Away From Loneliness" in 1966 on the Hy-Monty label, followed by "You Can't Do That" in 1968 on the Jay Boy label[2].

In 1969, producer and songwriter Jerry "Swamp Dogg" Williams Jr. discovered Duke and signed her to his label, renaming her Doris Duke[1]. Together they recorded her landmark debut album I'm A Loser in 1970 on Canyon Records, which became regarded as one of the greatest deep soul albums ever released[2]. The album's first single "To the Other Woman (I'm the Other Woman)" reached number seven on the US R&B Charts and number fifty on the Billboard 100, while the follow-up "Feet Start Walking" reached number thirty-nine on the R&B Charts[2]. However, the label's collapse prevented Duke from receiving royalties and derailed her momentum[2]. She recorded a second album with Swamp Dogg, A Legend In Her Own Time (1971), and a third album Woman (1974) for the British Contempo label, both of which received critical praise but limited commercial success[2]. Duke retired from music in the late 1970s, releasing one final single "I'll Make A Sweet Man (Out of You)" in 1982[2]. She maintained a low profile thereafter and died on March 21, 2019, at age 77[7].

## Fun Facts
- Duke's stage name created confusion in the music industry because a white heiress and tobacco fortune heir named Doris Duke also began performing with a gospel choir in New Jersey around the same time, leading to mix-ups between the two artists[1][2]
- I'm A Loser is considered one of soul music's first concept albums, with subject matter centered on relationships, love, and betrayal, showcasing Duke's ability to convey deep emotion through her weary, lived-in voice[2]
- Duke's sisters Jeraldine and Joyce Curry recorded as The Heartstoppers for the All Platinum label in the early 1970s, making music a family pursuit[1]
- Despite her critical acclaim and influence on deep soul music, Duke's death in 2019 went largely unnoticed by mainstream music publications, a fact music critics have since called a significant oversight[3]
