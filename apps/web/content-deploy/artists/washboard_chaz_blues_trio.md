## Biography
Washboard Chaz Leary is an internationally recognized acoustic country blues musician originally from New York who achieved prominence through his mastery of the washboard and distinctive blues vocals. He lived in Boulder, Colorado from 1975 to 1997, where he performed with numerous bands including the legendary Ophelia Swing Band, Prosperity Jazz Band, and Bleecker St., earning two finalist positions in KBCO's Boulder songwriting contest. Upon relocating to New Orleans in December 2000, Chaz quickly established himself as a seasoned musician by forming the Washboard Chaz Blues Trio with harmonica player Ben Maygarden and slide guitarist Roberto Luti, performing Piedmont finger-style, Delta, and Chicago blues styles. He subsequently became a fixture in the New Orleans music scene, performing with acclaimed ensembles including the Tin Men, Palmetto Bug Stompers, Washboard Rodeo, and the Jazz Vipers, while also becoming a featured performer in the globally popular Playing For Change video series.

Chaz's musical talents have been featured on over 100 recordings, including John Hammond's 1998 Grammy-nominated album "Long as I have You." His career encompasses performances at prestigious venues and festivals across North America and Europe, including the Bottom Line in New York City, the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, Telluride Bluegrass Festival, and Red Rocks Amphitheatre. He has shared stages with blues legends such as Bonnie Raitt, Taj Mahal, Muddy Waters, Robert Cray, Doc Watson, and Keb Mo. Beyond his performance career, Chaz has developed comprehensive percussion workshops for both adults and children and has participated in Blues in the Schools programs across multiple states. His reputation as a consummate musician and engaging performer has earned him recognition as one of New Orleans' most beloved adopted musical sons and a unique figure in the city's cultural community.
