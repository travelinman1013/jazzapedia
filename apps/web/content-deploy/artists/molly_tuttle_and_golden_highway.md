## Biography
Molly Rose Tuttle was born on January 14, 1993, in Santa Clara, California, and raised in Palo Alto. She began playing guitar at age 8 and made her onstage debut at age 11 with her father, Jack Tuttle, a bluegrass multi-instrumentalist and instructor. By age 15, she joined the family band The Tuttles with AJ Lee, alongside siblings Sullivan on guitar and Michael on mandolin, establishing her early roots in the bluegrass tradition.[1][2][6]

Tuttle's career advanced rapidly after moving to Nashville in 2015, where she collaborated with peers and heroes in bluegrass, Americana, and folk scenes. She formed The Molly Tuttle Band and became the first woman to win the International Bluegrass Music Association's Guitar Player of the Year in 2017, repeating in 2018 alongside the Americana Music Association's Instrumentalist of the Year. In 2021, she assembled Golden Highway—featuring mandolinist Dominick Leslie, banjoist Kyle Tuttle, fiddler Bronwyn Keith-Hynes, and bassist Shelby Means—releasing the Grammy-winning album *Crooked Tree* in 2022 and *City of Gold* in 2023, both earning Best Bluegrass Album honors. Her style blends traditional bluegrass flatpicking, clawhammer, and crosspicking guitar with singer-songwriter sophistication, pushing genre boundaries.[1][2][3][5][6]

Tuttle's accolades include IBMA Female Vocalist of the Year in 2023 and multiple awards for *Crooked Tree*, cementing her legacy as a trailblazing guitarist and innovator who honors bluegrass roots while expanding its reach into modern Americana.[2][3][4]
