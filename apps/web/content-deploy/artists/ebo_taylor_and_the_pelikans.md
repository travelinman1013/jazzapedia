## Biography
Ebo Taylor (born Deroy Taylor on 6 January 1936 – 7 February 2026) was a Ghanaian guitarist, composer, arranger, bandleader, and record producer who became one of Africa's most influential musicians over a career spanning more than six decades. Born in Saltpond near Cape Coast in Ghana's Central Region, Taylor began his musical education at age six learning piano, later transitioning to guitar and coming under the influence of the emerging highlife movement. In the late 1950s, he rose to prominence as lead guitarist and arranger for the Stargazers Band and Broadway Dance Band, two of the era's most popular highlife ensembles, where he composed enduring classics such as "Sika Enibre," "Owu Na Mewu," and "Ghana Be Ye Yie."

From 1962 to 1965, Taylor studied at the Eric Gilder School of Music in London, where he became a pivotal figure nurturing West African musicians and collaborating with Nigerian afrobeat pioneer Fela Kuti, as well as future Osibisa members Teddy Osei and Sol Amarfio. Upon returning to Ghana in 1965, he joined the Uhuru Dance Band and later became its leader, recording the innovative "Conflict" album for Essiebons Records. In 1974, he formed the Apagya Show Band, one of Ghana's most innovative Afro-bands of the 1970s, for which he wrote and arranged numerous compositions. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Taylor served as musical director and arranger for major Ghanaian record labels Essiebons and Gapophone, shaping the careers of renowned singers including C.K. Mann, Pat Thomas, Jewel Ackah, and Papa Yankson.

Taylor's solo work during the 1970s and 1980s—including albums such as "Ebo Taylor & the Pelikans" (1976) and "Twer Nyame" (1978)—demonstrated his signature fusion of traditional Ghanaian music, afrobeat, jazz, funk, and soul. From 2001 onward, he added an academic dimension to his career by teaching highlife and jazz guitar at the University of Ghana, allowing him to deepen his research into Ghana's regional musical traditions. In 2014, he became the first musician in Ghana to receive the Kwame Nkrumah African Genius Award. His music later gained international recognition when artists including Usher, Ludacris, and the Black Eyed Peas sampled his compositions. Taylor continued performing into his 90s, leading an eight-piece band that impressed audiences across Europe and beyond until his death on 7 February 2026.
