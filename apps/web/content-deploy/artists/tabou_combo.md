## Biography
Tabou Combo, a pioneering Haitian compas band, was founded in 1968 in Pétion-Ville, a suburb of Port-au-Prince, by teenagers Albert Chancy Jr. and Herman Nau, along with friends including Yves 'Fanfan' Joseph, Roger 'Shoubou' Marie Eugene, Jean-Claude Jean, and Yvon 'Kapi' André. Initially performing as Los Incognitos due to their obscurity, they rebranded to Tabou Combo in 1969 to align with Haitian culture and quickly gained fame by winning 'Best Musical Group of the Year' in a national televised talent contest, establishing them as one of Haiti's top bands. The group faced an early setback when Albert Chancy left for college in Montreal around 1970, leading to a temporary dissolution, but members reconvened in New York City in 1971 under new leadership from rhythm guitarist Jean-Claude Jean and later Adolphe Chancy.[1][2][3][4]

Relocating to Brooklyn, New York, Tabou Combo achieved international breakthrough in 1974 with their million-selling hit 'New York City,' captivating Europe and topping charts. They continued to evolve, blending compas (also known as konpa, Haiti's national dance rhythm) with elements of zouk, funk, and rara, releasing over 20 albums including the 1989 chart-topper 'Aux Antilles,' which won Best Album for Haitian Dance Music at the 1991 Caribbean Music Awards. The band toured globally—first to perform in Japan, Ivory Coast, and Senegal—earning titles like 'Official Panamanian Band' and becoming the first Caribbean act with a French Hit Parade number one, solidifying their status as ambassadors of Haitian music.[1][2][3][5]

Over five decades, Tabou Combo maintained a core sound driven by infectious rhythms, percussion, horns, and vocals, while adapting lineups; co-founder Herman Nau served as artistic director until his death in 2021. Their enduring legacy includes influencing the diaspora, performing at major festivals worldwide, and remaining a staple in Haitian households, with current members like Fanfan, Shoubou, and Kapi upholding the tradition.[1][4][6]
