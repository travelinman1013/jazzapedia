## Biography
William Ballard Doggett (February 16, 1916 – November 13, 1996) was an American jazz and rhythm and blues pianist and organist who became a pioneer of rock and roll. Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Doggett was introduced to music by his mother, a church pianist, at age 9. Though he initially dreamed of playing trumpet, his family's financial constraints led him to pursue keyboards instead, and he quickly mastered the instrument. By age 15, he had joined a Philadelphia area combo, performing in local theaters and clubs while attending high school. He was hailed as a child prodigy and formed his first band, the Five Majors, at 15.

Doggett's professional career began in earnest during the 1930s and early 1940s, when he worked as a sideman and arranger for bandleaders Lucky Millinder and Frank Fairfax, as well as arranger Jimmy Mundy. In 1942, he was hired as The Ink Spots' pianist and arranger, a position he held until 1944. His career trajectory shifted significantly in 1949 when he replaced Wild Bill Davis in Louis Jordan's Tympany Five, where he first achieved success playing the Hammond organ. In 1951, Doggett organized his own trio and began recording for King Records, the Cincinnati-based label that would become his primary recording home until 1960. His instrumental composition "Honky Tonk," co-written with Billy Butler and released in February 1956, became his signature work, selling four million copies and reaching No. 1 on the R&B chart and No. 2 on the Pop chart, where it topped the Billboard R&B chart for over two months. This landmark recording generated numerous offers to perform in rock and roll clubs, though Doggett remained committed to jazz and organ-based R&B throughout his career.

Beyond his own recordings, Doggett established himself as a highly sought-after arranger and session musician, working with Louis Armstrong, Count Basie, Ella Fitzgerald, and Lionel Hampton. He won the Cash Box award for best rhythm and blues performer in 1957, 1958, and 1959. After leaving King Records in 1960, he recorded for Warner Brothers, Columbia, ABC-Paramount, and Sue Records. His final recording session came in 1995 as a member and producer of the all-star jazz/R&B group Bluesiana Hurricane. Doggett continued to play and arrange music until his death from a heart attack in New York City on November 13, 1996.
