## Biography
John Haley 'Zoot' Sims was born on October 29, 1925, in Inglewood, California, into a family of vaudeville performers. He began playing drums and clarinet as a child, inspired by his older brother Ray Sims, a trombonist, and developed a passion for jazz through records by Ben Webster and Lester Young. At age 13, he switched to tenor saxophone, adopting Young's cool-toned, swinging style, and by 15 had dropped out of school to tour professionally with bands like Bobby Sherwood's and Ken Baker's, where he earned his nickname 'Zoot'.[1][2][5][6]

Sims rose to prominence in the 1940s, joining Benny Goodman's band in 1943 for an on-and-off association lasting until 1979, and then Woody Herman's Second Herd from 1947 to 1949, where he was part of the famed 'Four Brothers' saxophone section alongside Stan Getz, Herbie Steward (later Al Cohn), and Serge Chaloff, defining a lighter, Lester Young-influenced sound.[1][2][7] Freelancing thereafter, he collaborated extensively with Gerry Mulligan (1954-1956 sextet and 1960s Concert Jazz Band) and Al Cohn (co-led groups from late 1950s onward), worked with Buddy Rich, Artie Shaw, Stan Kenton, and later Count Basie and Sarah Vaughan on Pablo Records from 1975. Known for his exuberant yet mellow tone, swing feel, and melodic creativity across cool jazz, bebop, and hard bop, Sims doubled on soprano saxophone in the 1970s and remained active until his death on March 23, 1985, in New York City.[1][2][5][6]

Sims' legacy endures as a tenor sax master whose joyful, swinging style bridged big bands and small-group improvisation, influencing generations through prolific recordings and partnerships that showcased his adaptability and warmth, especially post-1970 marriage to journalist Louise Ault, which reportedly deepened his playing.[2][3][5]
