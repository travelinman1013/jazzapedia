## Biography
The Mahogany Brass Band is a New Orleans-based brass band rooted in the city's rich brass band tradition, blending traditional jazz elements with modern innovations like street funk and Cajun influences. Formed during the junior year of high school of one of its key members—likely the bandleader—who had prior experience with the Pinstripe Brass Band, the group emerged from the vibrant uptown New Orleans music scene. The bandleader's home became a central practice space for young musicians, fostering a collaborative environment that shaped the band's early sound, starting as a true traditional brass band before evolving to incorporate contemporary rhythms[2].

The band's career development reflects a commitment to progression within New Orleans' brass band heritage, drawing inspiration from icons like Louis Armstrong by adapting their sound to modern times—imagining how Armstrong might incorporate funk today. They have toured internationally, including performances in Italy, where discussions about innovation took place, and continue to transform their music by keeping traditional tracks while adding fresh elements. Genres listed on platforms like Spotify include brass band and Cajun, indicating a fusion style that honors roots while pushing boundaries[2].

While specific details on legacy are limited in available sources, the band's role as a training ground for emerging talent underscores its impact on the New Orleans scene, mentoring young bandleaders and musicians in both artistry and business[2].
