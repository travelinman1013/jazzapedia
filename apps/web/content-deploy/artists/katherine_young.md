## Biography
Katherine Young is a composer, bassoonist, and improviser specializing in electro-acoustic music characterized by curious timbres, expressive noises, and kinetic structures that explore the physicality of sound, interpersonal dynamics, and the familiar versus the strange.[1][2] She began her musical education as an undergraduate at Oberlin College and Conservatory, studying bassoon performance and comparative literature, before earning her MA in Composition at Wesleyan University and her DMA in Composition at Northwestern University.[1][2][4] Her academic work included studying with influential figures such as Anthony Braxton, Ron Kuivila, and Alvin Lucier at Wesleyan, and Hans Thomalla, Jay Alan Yim, Chris Mercer, and the late Lee Hyla at Northwestern, with her dissertation analyzing Braxton's opera Trillium J: The Non-Unconfessionables.[1]

Young's career as a performer and composer emphasizes collaboration and innovation, amplifying her bassoon with flexible electronics and participating in improvisation.[2][3] Her debut solo album, Further Secret Origins (2009), received acclaim from The Wire as a 'bassoon colossus' and Downbeat for its 'bold leaps for the bassoon.'[1][2] She has released notable recordings including her quartet Pretty Monsters' self-titled debut (2012), duos with Amy Cimini as Architeuthis Walks on Land, with Sam Scranton as Beautifulish, and with Anthony Braxton, as well as the multi-movement work Diligence Is to Magic as Progress Is to Flight on Parlour Tapes+.[1][3] Commissions from ensembles like Ensemble Dal Niente, Wet Ink, Talea, Spektral Quartet, LA Phil, Chicago Symphony Orchestra’s MusicNOW, Internationales Musikinstitut Darmstadt, and Third Coast Percussion highlight her rising prominence, alongside awards such as the Guggenheim Fellowship and Fromm Foundation Commission.[2][4]

Currently based in Atlanta on the homelands of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation, Young teaches composition, electronic music, improvisation, orchestration, and film composition at Emory University, having previously taught at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and Berklee College of Music.[2][4] Her practice centers on relationship building and ecological thinking, with ongoing projects including faculty roles at festivals like Darmstadt Internationale Ferienkurse für Neue Musik and New Music on the Point in 2026.[2] As a founding member of Till by Turning, she continues to push boundaries in contemporary music through performance, composition, and installation works like boundarymind.[1][3]
