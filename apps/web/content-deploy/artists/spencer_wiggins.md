## Biography
Spencer Wiggins Jr. was born on January 8, 1942, in Memphis, Tennessee, where he drew early musical inspiration from gospel at New Friendship Baptist Church on East Georgia Avenue. His parents had a strong interest in music, and while attending Booker T. Washington High School, he performed R&B with his brothers as half of the Four Stars alongside David Porter, graduating in 1961. Determined to pursue a secular singing career, Wiggins became a fixture on the Memphis club scene, particularly at Clifford Miller’s Flamingo Club (and its downstairs Sounderama Room), where he served as house vocalist backed by trumpeter Gene “Bowlegs” Miller, drummer Howard Grimes, and organist Isaac Hayes.[1][2][3]

Wiggins' breakthrough came when producer Quinton Claunch of Goldwax Records heard him perform and signed him, leading to his debut singles in 1965, including Isaac Hayes-penned tracks like “Lover’s Crime” and “What Do You Think About My Baby.” He followed with deep soul masterpieces such as “Take Me (Just As I Am)” and “Up Tight Good Woman,” both written by Dan Penn and Spooner Oldham, characterized by his melismatic, emotive vocals blending country-tinged ballads with Southern and deep soul styles. Later releases on Fame Records (“Love Machine,” “Double Lovin’” in 1970, his only national R&B hit at #44) and MGM Sounds Of Memphis (“I Can’t Be Satisfied”) failed commercially despite critical acclaim for his passionate delivery. Without a manager, Wiggins struggled financially, briefly reinventing as a bluesman in Florida before his band flaked on a 1973 Memphis gig.[1][2][3][5]

In 1976, Wiggins experienced a spiritual rebirth, renouncing secular music for gospel, relocating to Florida to become a deacon and choral director at New Birth Baptist Church in Miami. A 1977 gospel album aided by Al Green went unreleased, but he issued a 1999 cassette EP, *Jump for Jesus*. He resisted performing R&B live until later years, appearing at Italy’s Porretta Soul Festival in 2009 and a British concert in 2010. Recognized as a deep soul exponent, Wiggins passed away on February 13, 2023.[1][3][4]

## Fun Facts
- Wiggins turned down requests to perform his secular soul hits live from the mid-1970s until 2009, when he finally sang them at Italy’s Porretta Soul Festival co-billed with Percy Sledge.[1]
- His only national chart hit, “Double Lovin’” (1970, #44 R&B), was also covered by The Osmonds, reaching Top 20 pop in 1971.[1]
- After quitting secular music, a 1977 Japanese release of his Goldwax tracks as the album *Soul City USA* ironically became his debut LP—just as he fully committed to gospel.[2]
- Wiggins practiced with his band for up to three hours after late-night club gigs ending at 2 AM, showcasing his dedication in Memphis’ soul scene.[2]
