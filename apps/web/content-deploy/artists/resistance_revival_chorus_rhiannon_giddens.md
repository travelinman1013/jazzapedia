## Biography
Rhiannon Giddens, born February 21, 1977, in Greensboro, North Carolina, grew up immersed in diverse musical influences, including R&B and activist poetry, before training as an opera singer at Oberlin Conservatory, earning a B.M. in 2000. Returning to her home state, she immersed herself in traditional American roots music through contra dancing, Scottish song, and mentorship from fiddler Joe Thompson, leading her to co-found the Carolina Chocolate Drops in 2005 with Dom Flemons and Justin Robinson as a postmodern string band reviving African American string band traditions with banjo, fiddle, and old-time styles.[1][5][6]

Giddens' solo career launched in 2015 with *Tomorrow Is My Turn* on Nonesuch Records, produced by T Bone Burnett, featuring covers of icons like Patsy Cline and Nina Simone, earning acclaim for her powerful voice and historical depth. She has released further solo albums including *Freedom Highway* (2017), collaborations with Francesco Turrisi like *There Is No Other* (2019) and *They're Calling Me Home* (2021), and *You're the One* (2023), blending folk, Americana, bluegrass, and southern gothic. A two-time Grammy winner, MacArthur 'Genius' grant recipient (2017), and Pulitzer Prize winner for the 2023 opera *Omar* co-written with Michael Abels, she serves as artistic director of Silkroad since 2020 and advocates for overlooked Black contributions to American music.[1][2][3]

Her legacy includes challenging racial narratives in music history as an 'armchair historian,' composing for film like *Red Dead Redemption 2*, appearing in PBS series, and leading projects like the all-female banjo group Our Native Daughters, cementing her as a curator and innovator across opera, ballet, and folk traditions.[1][2][4]
