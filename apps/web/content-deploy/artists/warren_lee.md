## Biography
Warren Lee Taylor, known professionally as Warren Lee, was born on May 11, 1938, in Vacherie, Louisiana, where he grew up on the Laura Plantation before moving to New Orleans at age 9. As a singer and guitarist immersed in the New Orleans R&B and soul scene, he became a regular performer at iconic venues like the Dew Drop Inn, Jessie's in Marrero, and the Sugar Bowl in Thibodaux, often booked alongside artists such as Chris Kenner, Joe Tex, and Ernie K-Doe. His career took off in 1961 when Eddie Bo scouted him for Joe Ruffino’s Ric and Ron label, leading to his debut single 'Unemployed,' recorded at Cosimo Matassa’s studio and released within a week.[1][4][6]

Lee's musical style blended funky R&B, soul, and blues, characterized by infectious dance grooves and humorous, street-smart lyrics, earning him cult status in northern soul circles. Key releases include 'Star Revue' and 'Climb the Ladder' produced by Allen Toussaint and Marshall Sehorn on the DeeSu label in 1965, 'Funky Belly,' 'Geraldine,' 'London Bridge,' 'Key To Your Door,' and later tracks like 'Direct From the Ghetto' in 1974. Despite critical acclaim and live popularity, many singles failed to chart due to limited promotion and radio play, with Lee supporting himself by repairing air conditioners while leading his band Past, Present and Future until a 1977 stroke halted his performances.[1][4][5][7]

Lee's legacy endures through reissues like the 1982 Charly Records anthology *Sehorn’s Soul Farm*, where his tracks overshadowed better-known artists, cementing his reputation for storming funk anthems in New Orleans music history. His work exemplifies the raw energy of 1960s NOLA R&B, influencing northern soul enthusiasts worldwide.[1][7]
