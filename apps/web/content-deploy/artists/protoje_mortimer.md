## Biography
Oje Ken Ollivierre, professionally known as Protoje, was born on June 14, 1981, in Saint Elizabeth, Jamaica, to a musically influential family—his mother is Jamaican singer Lorna Bennett and his father is a former Calypso king. Protoje first gained attention in 2005 with his mixtape Lyrical Overdose Volume 1, which featured hip hop-influenced songs, but a guest appearance by Busy Signal redirected his career toward reggae and dancehall. Beginning in 2010, he partnered with his cousin Don Corleon at Don Corleon Records, establishing the foundation for his professional music career. His debut album The Seven Year Itch (2011) featured the breakthrough single "Arguments" (2009), which catalyzed his early popularity in Jamaica, followed by the collaboration "Rasta Love" with Ky-Mani Marley.

Protoje has become a leading figure in the contemporary reggae revival movement, releasing six studio albums: The Seven Year Itch (2011), The 8 Year Affair (2013), Ancient Future (2015), Royalty Free (2016), A Matter of Time (2018), In Search Of Lost Time (2020), and Third Time's The Charm (2022). His albums In Search Of Lost Time and Third Time's The Charm both achieved top 10 positions on the Billboard Reggae Albums chart, with the latter peaking at No. 8. Protoje has received Grammy nominations for A Matter of Time and Third Time's The Charm, establishing himself as a critically acclaimed artist. Beyond his solo work, he founded the In.Digg.Nation label and signed a deal with RCA Records in April 2020, which granted him creative control while allowing him to mentor emerging artists including Lila Iké and Sevana.

Protoje's musical style draws from traditional roots reggae while incorporating contemporary production and philosophical lyricism. He cited reggae artists Ini Kamoze and the group Black Uhuru as influences when developing his sound. His work is characterized by socially conscious messaging and spiritual themes, earning him recognition as a "philosophical thinker" who articulates righteous perspectives through his music. Leading the band The Indiggnation, Protoje has solidified his position as both a performer and mentor within Jamaica's reggae community.
