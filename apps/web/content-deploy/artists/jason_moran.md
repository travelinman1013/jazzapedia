## Biography
Jason Moran, born January 21, 1975, in Houston, Texas, grew up in the Pleasantville neighborhood influenced by his parents—father Andy, an investment banker, and mother Mary, a teacher—who exposed him to the Houston Symphony, museums, and artist John T. Biggers. Starting classical piano training at age six via the Suzuki method with Yelena Kurinets, Moran nearly quit until discovering Thelonious Monk in his father's vast record collection, sparking his jazz passion. He attended Houston’s High School for the Performing and Visual Arts, leading a jazz quartet, before earning a BM from the Manhattan School of Music in 1997, studying under Jaki Byard.[1][2][3][4]

Moran's career launched in 1997 when classmate Eric Harland recommended him to saxophonist Greg Osby for a European tour, leading to his recording debut on Osby's *Further Ado* and a Blue Note contract. His leader debut, *Soundtrack to Human Motion* (1999), featured Osby, Harland, Stefon Harris, and Lonnie Plaxico, forming the core of his trio The Bandwagon with bassist Tarus Mateen and drummer Nasheet Waits. Key releases include *Black Stars* (2001) with Sam Rivers, solo *Modernistic* (2002), *The Bandwagon* (2003), and collaborations like Charles Lloyd's quartet (2007 onward) and duo *Hagar's Song* (2013). His style fuses post-bop, avant-garde jazz, blues, classical, stride piano, hip-hop, and multimedia elements.[1][2][3][4][7]

A MacArthur Fellow (2010), inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (2022), and former Artistic Director of Jazz at The Kennedy Center (2011-2025), Moran teaches at New England Conservatory since 2010, residencies at Banff and others. He innovates through genre-crossing, performance art, and theatrical installations, earning acclaim as jazz's future innovator.[2][4][5][7]
