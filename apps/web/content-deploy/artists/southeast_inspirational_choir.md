## Biography
The Southeast Inspirational Choir was founded in 1970 in Houston, Texas, by three visionary gospel musicians: Brenda Waters, Shirley Joiner, and Carl Preacher. Beginning as a tight-knit group of young singers in the 1970s, they performed intricate gospel melodies such as 'Some Sweet Day' led by Brenda Waters and 'He Included Me' led by Francis Lee, with strong support from parents, church members, and community who provided transportation and chaperoning. Their unique sound blended passionate directing, skilled playing, and worshipful singing in the traditional gospel style, drawing from Church of God in Christ affiliations.[1][2][4]

In 1975, Brenda Waters transitioned to a solo ministry, leaving Shirley Joiner and Carl Preacher as co-directors. By 1978, the group formalized as the Southeast Inspirational Choir, expanding to include young singers from other Houston churches and recording on labels like Savoy, Jewel, Sweet Rain, and Soul Bird. Notable lead singers included Jesse Jones, Anna Boney, Darrel Pitts, Evelyn Booker, and Carl Preacher himself. The choir's ministry endured challenges, with founders passing away—Brenda in 2005, Carl in 2005, and Shirley in 2009—yet their legacy persisted through reunion concerts, such as the 2007 38th anniversary event featuring Donald Lawrence, and recent projects like the 2025 EP 'Legacy'.[1][3]

Celebrating 55 years by 2025, the choir's influence spans generations, birthing ministers, pastors, and artists while maintaining a spirit of excellence and generational worship. Their model of family-like bonds and youth training, including groups like Prepared Holy Disciples (PHD), continues to impact gospel music.[1][3]
