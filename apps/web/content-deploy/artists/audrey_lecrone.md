## Biography
Audrey LeCrone was born and raised in rural Kansas, specifically in Bennington, north of Salina, by artist parents as a third-generation teacher and musician. Her childhood was immersed in creative pursuits including writing, reading, speechmaking, singing, improvising, and dancing. She earned a BFA in Acting from Oklahoma City University, where she also ran the university’s tutoring center and taught ESL to international graduate students, blending her passions for performance and education.[1][3][6]

Transitioning from acting, LeCrone founded a successful accent coaching business after a Russian doctor sought help for communication with patients, leading her to specialize in American accents for professionals and actors over the past 12+ years. She has worked with clients from over 70 countries, including high-profile projects like coaching Daniel Kaluuya for his Oscar-winning role as Fred Hampton in 'Judas and the Black Messiah' (2021), contributing to 13 major awards and 15 nominations. Initially splitting time between acting and coaching, she fully committed to teaching before recognizing a need to reconnect with performance pressures, prompting her in 2022 to launch a second career as a jazz singer in New Orleans.[1][3]

As a jazz vocalist, LeCrone fronts the band Audrey & the CrawZaddies, performing sultry jazz in fancy dresses on weekends while maintaining her core identity as a 'language nerd.' Her musical style draws from her lifelong performing arts background, allowing her to stay connected to the challenges of memory, presence, and emotion under pressure—skills she imparts to actor clients. Though her music career is nascent with low popularity, it complements her accent coaching, helping her relate to performers facing high stakes.[1][2]
