## Biography
Maridalen is a Norwegian jazz trio formed by musicians Anders Hefre on saxophones and clarinet, Jonas Kilmork Vemøy on trumpet, and Andreas Rødland Haga on double bass. Named after the scenic Maridalen valley north of Oslo, the group originated as a practice ensemble that evolved into a distinctive project blending warm harmonies from double bass, trumpet, and woodwind without chordal instruments. Their music draws from Swedish jazz, minimalist film scores, French Impressionism, and noirish soundtracks, creating intimate, transparent soundscapes that evoke moods, stories, and atmospheres like forgotten cities and night-lit streets[1][2][4].

The trio's debut self-titled album *Maridalen*, recorded in the historic wooden Maridalen Church in 2019-2020 and released in 2021 on Jazzland Recordings, earned widespread acclaim, appearing on Aftenposten's best Norwegian albums list and MOJO Magazine's jazz albums of the year. Their second album *Bortenfor* (2022), also recorded in the same church, was hailed as the best jazz record of 2022 by Dagsavisen and 'Album der Woche' on German WDR radio, featuring guests like pedal steel guitarist Emil Brattested and pianist Aleksander Sjølie. The third album *Gressholmen* followed in April 2024, recorded in a cabin on Oslofjord's Gressholmen island, with contributions from Brattested and percussionist Erland Dahlen, and celebrated with sold-out release concerts at Oslo Jazz Festival[1][2][4].

Maridalen has built a strong reputation on the national and international jazz scene, performing at festivals including Oslo Jazz Festival, Nordic Jazz Festival (Netherlands), Ora Jazz Festival (Romania), Aberdeen Jazz Festival, and London Jazz Festival. Their chamber jazz style emphasizes collective interplay, space, and improvisation, positioning them as part of a new wave in Scandinavian jazz[2][5].
