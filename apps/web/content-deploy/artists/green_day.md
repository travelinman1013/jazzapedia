## Biography
Green Day is an American rock band formed in Rodeo, California, in 1987 by lead singer and guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong and bassist Mike Dirnt, with drummer Tré Cool joining in 1990. Armstrong and Dirnt, both teenagers from the San Francisco Bay Area, initially met in grade school and bonded over punk bands like the Ramones and Dead Kennedys. They started as Sweet Children in 1987 with early members including drummer Raj Punjabi and bassist Sean Hughes, later recruiting John 'Al Sobrante' Kiffmeyer. Signed to Lookout! Records by Larry Livermore, they released their debut EP *1,000 Hours* in 1989 and changed their name to Green Day, a reference to their marijuana use. Early albums like *39/Smooth* (1990) and *Kerplunk* (1992) built a cult following in the punk scene, playing venues like 924 Gilman Street.

Their major-label breakthrough came with *Dookie* (1994) on Reprise Records, which sold over 20 million copies worldwide, featured hits like 'Longview' and 'Basket Case,' and reignited mainstream punk interest, earning a Grammy for Best Alternative Music Album. The band evolved with politically charged rock operas *American Idiot* (2004) and *21st Century Breakdown* (2009), blending punk's raw energy with melodic pop sensibilities and lyrics addressing teenage angst, suburbia, and social issues. Inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012, Green Day has sold over 85 million albums, maintaining relevance through consistent touring and releases like *Father of All...* (2020).

Their musical style, rooted in punk rock and pop punk, draws from classic influences while pioneering a catchy, accessible sound that influenced generations. Genres include punk and pop punk, with a current Spotify popularity of 81.
