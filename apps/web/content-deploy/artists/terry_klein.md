## Biography
Terry Klein is an Austin, Texas-based singer-songwriter known for his work in Americana and alt-country genres. Originally from the Dallas area, he pursued a successful career as a litigation lawyer in Boston, Massachusetts, heading a thriving practice for fifteen years while raising his wife and two daughters. In his early 20s, Klein played in a thrash funk/heavy metal band in Los Angeles, performing at venues like the Whiskey A Go Go and The Troubadour, and briefly studied jazz in New York, practicing seven hours a day. However, he set music aside until around 2011, when he rediscovered country, folk, and singer-songwriter styles. He wrote his first song in November 2013 at age 40, followed by intensive writing and open mics in Boston starting in 2014, playing three to five per week by early 2016.[1][3][4][5]

In mid-2016, Klein relocated his family to Austin, Texas, quickly securing gigs and releasing his debut album *Great Northern* in 2017, produced by Walt Wilkins and engineered by Ron Flynt. The album earned praise from Rodney Crowell and Mary Gauthier, appearing on multiple Top Ten lists. He followed with *Tex* (also with Wilkins), which charted in the Top-20 US Folk DJ and Top-15 EuroAmericana charts, and later *Hill Country Folk Music* (2025), produced by Thomm Jutz in Nashville. Klein's style blends acoustic folk with wry, existential lyrics inspired by heroes like Hank Williams, John Prine, and Lightnin' Hopkins, alongside literature, film, painting, and unexpected influences like Beastie Boys and classic rock.[1][2][3][6][7][8]

Now a full-time musician touring North America and Europe, Klein is celebrated by peers as a 'songwriter’s songwriter,' with the Austin American-Statesman naming him one of Austin's top singer-songwriters. His songs draw from real-life experiences, such as Cape Cod summers and personal family stories, resonating globally through vivid storytelling and emotional depth.[1][3][7]

## Fun Facts
- Before songwriting, Klein was in a thrash funk/heavy metal band in 1990s Los Angeles that played the Whiskey A Go Go and Troubadour, later studying jazz intensely in New York.[1]
- His song owes a groove to Beastie Boys' 'Something's Got To Give' from *Check Your Head*, which the session players intuitively captured without instruction.[1]
- Klein didn't write his first original song until age 40 in 2013 and first performed one onstage a week before turning 41.[1][4]
- He played 3-5 open mics weekly in Boston from January to June 2016 right before moving to Austin, where he rapidly transitioned to paid gigs.[1]
