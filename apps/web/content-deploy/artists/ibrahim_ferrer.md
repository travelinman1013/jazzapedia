## Biography
Ibrahim Ferrer (1927–2005) was born on February 20, 1927, in San Luis near Santiago de Cuba, during a social club dance where his mother unexpectedly went into labor; orphaned at age 12, he survived by selling newspapers and produce before starting his professional singing career at 14 with local groups like Los Jóvenes del Son.[1][2][5][7] He rose to prominence in the 1940s and 1950s, performing with Conjunto Sorpresa, Maravilla de Beltrán under Pacho Alonso, Chepín y su Orquesta Oriental—where he scored a hit with 'El Platanal de Bartolo' in 1955—and as a backup vocalist for Beny Moré's Banda Gigante after moving to Havana in 1957; he later spent nearly 40 years with Los Bocucos.[2][3][4][5] Despite his talent for boleros, he was often directed toward upbeat son and dance music, and by the 1980s, post-revolution economic changes led him to retire in 1991.[1][4]

Ferrer's career revived dramatically in 1996 at age 69 when producer Nick Gold and Ry Cooder invited him to record with the Afro-Cuban All Stars on *A Toda Cuba le Gusta* (Grammy-nominated) and then the landmark *Buena Vista Social Club* album, which showcased his masterful bolero style and brought global fame via the 1999 Wim Wenders documentary.[1][2][3] He toured worldwide with the Buena Vista Social Club, performing at venues like Carnegie Hall, and released acclaimed solo albums including *Buena Vista Social Club Presents Ibrahim Ferrer* (2000, Latin Grammy for Best New Artist at 72) and *Buenos Hermanos*, earning three Grammys and selling millions.[1][3] Ferrer remained humble and supportive of the Cuban revolution until his death on August 6, 2005.[4]

Known for his golden voice in **son cubano**, **bolero**, **afro-Cuban jazz**, and **Latin jazz**, Ferrer's style blended romantic bolero mastery with improvisational sonero flair, revitalizing traditional Cuban music for new generations and cementing his legacy as a Buena Vista icon.[1][2][4]
