## Biography
Joseph Pierre "Big Chief Monk" Boudreaux (born December 7, 1941) is an African-American musician and the Big Chief of the Golden Eagles, a Mardi Gras Indian tribe based in New Orleans, Louisiana. Boudreaux began his involvement with the Mardi Gras Indian tradition at age 12 when he became the Second Spyboy for the White Eagles, led by Big Chief Lawrence Fletcher. His father, Raymond Boudreaux, a carpenter and former member of the Creoles and Wild Squatoolas Mardi Gras Indian gangs, introduced him to the culture. After an internal dispute dissolved the White Eagles, Boudreaux joined the Golden Eagles in the early 1960s (when the tribe changed its name from the White Eagles in 1962) and eventually became the Big Chief in the early 1970s. Remarkably, his father later rejoined the tradition as Monk's Second Chief of the Golden Eagles.

In the late 1960s, Boudreaux also joined the Wild Magnolias, the legendary Mardi Gras Indian group led by his childhood friend Big Chief Bo Dollis, with whom he collaborated for over 30 years. In 1970, he appeared with the Wild Magnolias at the first New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, and that same year the group released "Handa Wanda," the first studio-recorded music by the Mardi Gras Indians. Boudreaux's musical career has spanned nearly six decades, during which he has performed at prestigious venues including Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Center, and Saturday Night Live, as well as internationally in the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Japan. He is recognized as the oldest living Mardi Gras Indian Chief and serves as the "Elder of Elders" in a tradition dating back to the 1800s.

Boudreaux's artistry extends beyond performance to composition, recording, costume design, and sewing—all central to the Mardi Gras Indian tradition. His musical style blends the folk traditions of Mardi Gras Indian culture—characterized by percussion, hypnotic chanting, and improvisational singing—with R&B and funk elements. He has recorded critically acclaimed albums including *Bury the Hatchet* with Anders Osborne (2002), *Mr. Stranger Man* with the Golden Eagles (2003), and a reggae-influenced project recorded in Jamaica. His contributions to preserving and evolving New Orleans' musical heritage have earned him numerous accolades, including a 2016 National Endowment for the Arts National Heritage Fellowship and a 2017 Lifetime Achievement Award from OffBeat magazine.
