## Biography
Nathaniel 'Nat' Shilkret (December 25, 1889 – February 18, 1982) was an American composer, conductor, clarinetist, pianist, business executive, and music director who became one of the most prolific figures in recording history. Born in New York City to an Austrian immigrant musical family, Shilkret was a child prodigy who toured nationally with the New York Boys' Orchestra from ages 7 to 13 as their clarinet soloist. From his late teens through mid-twenties, he performed as a clarinetist in prestigious New York ensembles including the New York Philharmonic Society (under Gustav Mahler and Vassily Safanov), the Metropolitan Opera House Orchestra, and bands led by John Philip Sousa, Arthur Pryor, and Edwin Franko Goldman.

In 1915, Shilkret joined the Foreign Department of the Victor Talking Machine Company (later RCA Victor), rapidly ascending to manager and eventually becoming 'Director of Light Music' in 1926. During his tenure at Victor, he conducted thousands of recordings—possibly more than any individual in recording history—with estimated sales reaching 50 million copies. He pioneered numerous recording innovations: conducting Victor's first electrically recorded disc in 1925, the first commercial long-playing record in 1931, and the first successful dubbing of electrical orchestra accompaniment over acoustically recorded vocals (notably Enrico Caruso's). Between 1925 and 1941, he made over 3,000 radio broadcasts. His premiere recording of George Gershwin's 'An American in Paris' in 1929 was among five of his recordings that eventually earned Grammy Awards.

After leaving Victor in 1935, Shilkret relocated to Los Angeles, where he contributed music scores and served as musical director for Hollywood studios including RKO (1935-1937), Walter Lantz Productions (1937), and MGM (1942-1946). He received an Oscar nomination for scoring Maxwell Anderson's stage drama 'Winterset' in 1936. From 1946 through the mid-1950s, he worked with RKO-Pathe producing short films. Shilkret's compositional legacy includes 'The Lonesome Road' (co-written with Gene Austin, recorded by over 200 artists including Louis Armstrong, Bing Crosby, and Frank Sinatra) and 'Jeannine, I Dream of Lilac Time' (which sold nearly two million copies of sheet music). He was inducted into the Songwriter's Hall of Fame and won five Grammy Awards before his death in New York in 1982.
