## Biography
Alberto Juscamaita Gastelú, known locally as Raktako, was a renowned Peruvian guitarist, composer, and mentor from Ayacucho in the Andes region.[3] He became a legendary figure in the preservation and performance of traditional Huayno guitar music from the Cuzco and Ayacucho regions, with recordings documenting his work from the 1930s-1940s period.[2][3] Raktako dedicated his life to mastering and teaching the intricate Andean guitar styles, becoming an influential mentor to generations of guitarists who studied under his guidance in his home in Ayacucho.[3]

His legacy extends beyond his own performances through his role as a teacher and cultural custodian of traditional Andean music. Raktako represented a crucial link in the transmission of Huayno guitar traditions, an art form that blends Spanish guitar techniques with indigenous Quechuan musical sensibilities.[1] His mentorship shaped the development of contemporary Andean guitar music, most notably influencing Gustavo Yashimura-Arce, who studied intensively under him beginning in 2008 to learn songs and styles from across the Andes with particular focus on Ayacucho traditions.[1]
