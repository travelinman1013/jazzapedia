## Biography
The Sisters Love was an American R&B and funk girl group formed in 1968 in Los Angeles by former members of Ray Charles's backing ensemble, The Raelettes, who had quit under unhappy circumstances. Initially led by Merry Clayton, the group—featuring members like Jeannie Long, Vermettya Royster, Lillie Fort, Gwen Berry, and Odia Coates—developed a distinctive style blending fiery soul, funk, and gospel influences, often performing in colorful African-inspired stage attire that emphasized black pride. They released their debut single in 1968 on Manchild Records and signed with A&M Records in 1969, recording six singles without major commercial success, including an appearance in the 1973 blaxploitation film *The Mack* singing 'Now Is the Time'.[1][2]

In 1971, while still with A&M, they scored their biggest hit with 'Are You Lonely?', written and produced by Gene Chandler, reaching #20 on the Billboard R&B chart. The group then moved to Motown's MoWest subsidiary in 1972, working with producers like Hal Davis, Willie Hutch, and Gloria Jones, and touring with the Jackson 5. They recorded material for the album *With Love*, which was shelved until its 2010 release by Reel Music, featuring tracks like the Northern Soul favorite 'I'm Learning To Trust My Man' and a cover of Curtis Mayfield's 'Give Me Your Love'. MoWest's closure in 1973 led to their final Motown single, after which the original group disbanded.[1][2]

A reformed version of Sisters Love recorded for Ian Levine's Motorcity Records in 1989, releasing 'No More Broken Hearts', while lead singer Vermettya Royster pursued solo work, including a 1991 remake of 'Give Me Your Love' and her 2009 album *On The Half Shell* with re-recordings of group tracks. Their legacy endures in Northern Soul circles, with songs like 'Give Me Your Love' revived by DJs such as Danny Krivit in 1980, and compilations like the 2006 Soul Jazz Records release cementing their status as an underappreciated gem of 1970s soul and funk.[1][2]
