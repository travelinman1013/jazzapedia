## Biography
William C. 'Buster' Bailey (July 19, 1902 – April 12, 1967) was born in Memphis, Tennessee, and began his musical career as a teenager playing clarinet with W.C. Handy's Orchestra, touring from 1917 to 1919. He moved to Chicago in 1919, joining Erskine Tate’s Vendome Orchestra until 1923, then King Oliver’s Creole Jazz Band, where he befriended Louis Armstrong. In 1924, at Armstrong's recommendation, Bailey joined Fletcher Henderson’s Orchestra in New York, establishing himself as a top clarinetist with a fast, smooth style during the swing era, contributing solos to tracks like 'Sugar Foot Stomp' and 'Clarinet Marmalade'.[1][2][3]

Bailey's mid-career was marked by versatility as a session musician, recording with blues singers, Clarence Williams, and others in the late 1920s. He toured Europe with Noble Sissle’s Orchestra in 1927 and 1929, rejoined Henderson intermittently through the 1930s, played with the Mills Blue Rhythm Band, and joined John Kirby’s Sextet in 1937 (initially formed with members from Henderson), staying until 1946. His cool tone and technical precision shone in Kirby’s sophisticated arrangements, including sessions like 'Afternoon in Africa'. In later years, he led his own short-lived band in 1946, worked with Wilbur de Paris (1947-1949), Henry 'Red' Allen through the 1950s, Wild Bill Davison (1961-1963), Saints and Sinners (1963-1964), and finally Louis Armstrong’s All-Stars from 1965 until his death from a heart attack in New York City.[1][2][3]

Known for his swing and jazz genres, Bailey's legacy endures as one of the era's premier clarinetists, bridging early jazz, big band swing, and later traditional styles, with a reputation for flawless ensemble playing and exciting solos that influenced the instrument's role in large ensembles.[1][2][3]

## Fun Facts
- Bailey was considered the top big band clarinetist of the mid-1920s before Barney Bigard rose with Ellington, with exciting solos on Henderson tracks like 'Fidgety Feet'.[2]
- He recorded in England during his 1929 European tour with Noble Sissle, showcasing his international reach.[2]
- Bailey led 'Buster Bailey and His Rhythm Busters' in 1937 and briefly his own band in 1946, hinting at bebop influences in titles like 'Dizzy Debutante'.[3]
- Despite segregation limiting studio work, his Henderson reputation kept him freelancing steadily through the Depression.[2]
