## Biography
Slack Key 'Ohana is a Southern California-based band founded in 2021 by guitarist and vocalist Brian Witkin and Kamaka Mullen, blending Hawaiian slack key guitar traditions with earthy Americana, harmony-rich pop vocals, and tropical vibes. The group, meaning 'family' in Hawaiian, features Witkin's parents Carol Witkin (ukulele and vocals) and Joe Witkin (keyboardist, vocalist, U-bass; original Woodstock performer with Sha Na Na), brother Sean Witkin (drums and percussion), and Hawai'i-based lap steel guitar player Rand Anderson. Their self-titled debut album entered iTunes World Music charts at No. 2, won Best World Music Album at the 2022 San Diego Music Awards, and earned Nā Hōkū Hanohano Award nominations, the Hawaiian equivalent of the GRAMMYs.[1][2]

The band's career rapidly advanced with over 100 shows annually in 2022-2023 at island music festivals, leading to the live album 'Live at Tiki Oasis,' their first iTunes World Music No. 1 debut and another San Diego Music Awards nomination. In 2023, they released the single 'Nahenahe Ka Leo o Ka Wahine Uʻi,' followed by the album 'Hawaiian Cowboy' (2025), recorded at Foo Fighters' Studio 606, featuring guests like ZZ Top's Billy Gibbons and slack key master George Kahumoku Jr., and nominated for GRAMMY consideration. Their style honors slack key roots from Hawaiian paniolo cowboys while incorporating pop elements, with upcoming 'Mai Tais in Paradise' (spring 2026) previewed by 'Slack Key Blues' featuring Rand Anderson.[1][2][6]

Rand Anderson, a Nā Hōkū Hanohano-nominated multi-instrumentalist based in Hawai'i, frequently collaborates with Slack Key 'Ohana on pedal steel guitar, lap steel, and recordings, spanning genres like Americana, slack key, and hapa haole. Proficient on guitar, dobro, mandolin, and more, Anderson records and performs often with the band, contributing to their authentic island sound and ethos of aloha.[1][7][8]
