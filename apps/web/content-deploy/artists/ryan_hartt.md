## Biography
Ryan Hartt, a Connecticut-based harmonica player, vocalist, and songwriter, grew up listening to his father's big band records, which sparked his early interest in music. Drawn to the blues in his teens during the late 1980s and early 1990s, he developed into a rock-solid harmonica player and soulful singer, influenced by the vibrant New England blues scene in Boston and Providence. After completing musical studies, Hartt moved to Los Angeles in the late 1990s to immerse himself in West Coast blues, frequently sitting in with legends like Lynwood Slim, Junior Watson, Rick Holmstrom, and Rod Piazza's Mighty Flyers.[1][2][3][5]

Returning to the East Coast in 2000, Hartt formed Ryan Hartt & The Blue Hearts, a powerhouse blues band that became a staple in New England's scene for over two decades. The band released three acclaimed albums—Empty Wallet (2003), Yeah Man (2005), and Call My Name (2012)—earning regional awards, international recognition, and a finalist spot in the Blues Foundation’s 2006 International Blues Challenge for Best Self-Produced CD. Hartt's style blends Chicago-style grooves, West Coast swing, 1940s jump blues, 1950s Chicago blues, and Excello Louisiana swamp blues, marked by his fiery stage presence, sharp songwriting, and authentic energy. The band toured extensively across the U.S., sharing stages with harmonica icons like Rod Piazza, Rick Estrin, and Mark Hummel.[1][2][3][4][5]

In 2025, Hartt released his solo debut Be About It!, self-produced with longtime Blue Hearts bassist Jeffrey Berg, showcasing his evolution as a storyteller while staying rooted in traditional blues with a fresh, contemporary edge. Fronting the band for over 25 years without a steady lineup in the last decade, Hartt continues to champion raw, heartfelt American roots music through live performances and recordings.[1][3][4][5][7]
