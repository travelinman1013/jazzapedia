## Biography
Percy Jones, born on 3 December 1947 near Llandrindod Wells, Powys, Wales, United Kingdom, is a pioneering Welsh fretless bass guitarist known for his innovative contributions to jazz fusion and progressive rock. Self-taught, he drew early inspiration from jazz upright bassist Charles Mingus and British and American rhythm and blues, developing a distinctive style featuring glissandos, harmonics, and three-finger riffage. His career began in the mid-1960s with the poetry-and-jazz group The Liverpool Scene, which brought him to New York in 1969, where he first met Mingus. After the group disbanded, Jones freelanced before joining Brand X in 1974, becoming one of the original proponents of fretless bass in rock music.

Jones rose to prominence with Brand X, contributing to albums like *Unorthodox Behaviour* (1976), which nearly didn't see release until picked up by Charisma Records with help from Phil Collins, who played drums on the record before Genesis commitments limited him. He also collaborated with Brian Eno on landmark albums such as *Another Green World* (1975), showcasing spatial bass tones that anticipated later electronic genres. Brand X toured extensively, particularly in the US, leading Jones to relocate to New York City in the 1980s after meeting his wife. Post-Brand X (which ended around 1980), he worked as a sideman and solo artist with acts like Roy Harper, Steve Hackett, David Sylvian, and Tunnels, while playing in local bands like Noise Are Us (later Paranoise) at CBGBs.

Throughout his career, Jones has maintained an original style blending jazz fusion grooves with experimental phrasing, often compared to elite bassists like Jaco Pastorius, Anthony Jackson, and Stanley Clarke. Now based in New York, he continues as a composer, arranger, multi-instrumentalist, and educator, with a lasting legacy in fusion bass techniques.
