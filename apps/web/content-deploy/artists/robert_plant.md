## Biography
Robert Anthony Plant was born on August 20, 1948, in West Bromwich, Staffordshire, England. Facing pressure from his parents to become a chartered accountant, he left home at age 16, worked in road construction, and immersed himself in music. In 1966, he co-founded the Band of Joy with future Led Zeppelin drummer John Bonham, though it disbanded by 1968. That year, while performing with Obs-Tweedle, he was scouted by Jimmy Page, who was forming a new band after the Yardbirds' split. Plant impressed Page with his rendition of Jefferson Airplane's 'Somebody to Love' and recommended Bonham, leading to the formation of Led Zeppelin with Page, Bonham, and John Paul Jones[1][2].

Led Zeppelin's debut album in 1969 catalyzed heavy metal, blending blues, rock, and acoustic elements, propelled by Plant's powerful, wide-ranging voice, flamboyant stage presence, and raw lyrics. The band released nine studio albums, becoming one of rock's most influential acts until Bonham's death in 1980 ended it. Plant's persona, dubbed 'Percy,' added swagger to their appeal. Post-Zeppelin, he launched a solo career with albums like *Pictures at Eleven* (1982), explored early rock with the Honeydrippers (1984), and experimented further in *Shaken 'n' Stirred* (1985)[1][2].

Plant's later career embraced diverse styles, notably his Grammy-winning collaboration with Alison Krauss on *Raising Sand* (2007), blending rock, blues, folk, and bluegrass, earning Album of the Year and Record of the Year for 'Please Read the Letter' in 2009. He revived Band of Joy in 2010, formed the Sensational Space Shifters in 2012, and reunited with Krauss in 2021. Regarded as one of rock's greatest singers, his legacy spans heavy rock innovation and genre-crossing reinvention[1][2].

## Fun Facts
- Plant declined a $200 million offer to tour with Led Zeppelin after their 2007 reunion concert, prioritizing his solo path[1].
- He once reflected tongue-in-cheek on his Led Zeppelin showmanship, noting his 'staggering degree of bravado and swagger' enhanced the band's appeal[1].
- Led Zeppelin's debut was initially called the 'New Yardbirds' due to a booked Scandinavian tour obligation[1][2].
- Plant's early band Obs-Tweedle led to his discovery when he sang Jefferson Airplane's 'Somebody to Love' for Jimmy Page[1].
