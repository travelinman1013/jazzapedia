## Biography
Dee Dee Bridgewater, a Grammy and Tony Award-winning jazz vocalist born and raised in Flint, Michigan, began her career in the 1960s after attending Michigan State University, gaining early professional experience with the Thad Jones/Mel Lewis Big Band and performing alongside jazz icons like Max Roach, Sonny Rollins, Dexter Gordon, and Dizzy Gillespie throughout the 1970s. After exploring pop in the 1980s, she relocated to Paris and refocused on jazz, earning Grammy Awards for Best Vocal Jazz Album with *Eleanora Fagan (1915-1959): To Billie With Love From Dee Dee* and *Dear Ella*, while also winning a Tony for her role as Glinda in *The Wiz* and receiving a Laurence Olivier nomination for *Lady Day*. Bill Charlap, a Grammy-winning pianist from a musical family—son of Broadway composer Moose Charlap and vocalist Sandy Stewart—started playing piano at age three, formed the acclaimed Bill Charlap Trio in 1997 with bassist Peter Washington and drummer Kenny Washington, and has interpreted the Great American Songbook with artists like Tony Bennett, earning a Grammy for *The Silver Lining: The Songs of Jerome Kern* in 2016.[1][2][3]

Bridgewater and Charlap represent distinct yet complementary styles in vocal jazz and piano trio traditions, with Bridgewater known for her bold reinterpretations of standards, theatrical flair, and genre-bridging explorations including French jazz influences, and Charlap celebrated for his sensitive, swinging mastery of composers like Gershwin, Berlin, Ellington, Porter, and Sondheim. Their duo collaboration, featuring telepathic rapport and alchemical chemistry, has led to live performances worldwide, guest appearances like Bridgewater with the Bill Charlap Trio and Nicholas Payton, and their debut album *Elemental* released in June 2025 on Mack Avenue Records, nominated for a Grammy in Best Jazz Vocal Album.[3][4][6][9] Bridgewater serves as a UN FAO Goodwill Ambassador and founded The Woodshed Network to mentor women in jazz, while Charlap has directed Jazz in July at 92NY and now leads Jazz Studies at William Paterson University.[1][2][3][5]

Their legacy endures through decades of innovation: Bridgewater as a three-time Grammy winner, NEA Jazz Master, and Tony recipient honored with a stage dedication at the New Orleans Jazz Market, and Charlap as a Songbook authority with worldwide tours, productions for Jazz at Lincoln Center, and frequent duos with wife Renee Rosnes. Together, they continue touring as a duo, reimagining classics with warmth, wit, and soul, solidifying their status as jazz legends.[1][2][3][4]
