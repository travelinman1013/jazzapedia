## Biography
Ralph Towner (March 1, 1940 – January 18, 2026) was born in Chehalis, Washington into a musical family; his mother was a piano teacher and his father a trumpet player. He began learning piano at age three and developed into a conservatory-trained classical pianist, attending the University of Oregon from 1958 to 1963, where he studied composition with Homer Keller. He furthered his classical guitar training at the Vienna Academy of Music with Karl Scheit from 1963 to 1964 and again from 1967 to 1968. In the late 1960s, Towner moved to New York City and immersed himself in the jazz scene, initially working as a pianist influenced by Bill Evans before transitioning to classical and 12-string guitars. He joined Paul Winter's pioneering Consort ensemble in the late 1960s, where he met future bandmates Glen Moore, Paul McCandless, and Collin Walcott.

In 1970, Towner and his Consort colleagues formed Oregon, an influential acoustic jazz ensemble that blended folk music, Indian classical forms, and avant-garde jazz-influenced free improvisation throughout the 1970s and beyond. Simultaneously, Towner began a defining relationship with ECM Records, debuting as a leader in 1973 with *Trios/Solos* and releasing over 50 albums with the label across five decades. His solo work became particularly notable for synthesizing classical contrapuntal composition with improvisational jazz, exemplified by landmark recordings such as *Solstice* (1975) with Jan Garbarek, *Solo Concert* (1980), and *At First Light* (2023). Known for his rich, layered sound that defied genre categorization, Towner collaborated extensively with jazz pioneers including Keith Jarrett, Gary Peacock, John Abercrombie, and Gary Burton. In 1982, he relocated to Seattle before moving to Italy in the early 1990s to be with his wife, Italian actress Mariella Lo Sardo, whom he married in 1994. He remained in Rome until his death on January 18, 2026, at age 85.

## Fun Facts
- Towner created a unique percussive guitar effect by weaving a matchbook among the strings at the neck of his instrument, as demonstrated on 'Donkey Jamboree' from the album Slide Show with Gary Burton.
- He began his musical training exceptionally early, learning to improvise on piano at just three years old and starting formal music instruction at age six.
- Towner's solo album Solo Concert (1980) was conceptually groundbreaking—a live solo guitar recital that synthesized classical contrapuntal composition with improvisational jazz in oddly-metered forms, an approach no other guitarist had attempted at that time.
- Despite being best known for his guitar work, Towner was a true multi-instrumentalist who played twelve-string guitar, classical guitar, electric guitar, piano, synthesizer, percussion, trumpet, and French horn, sometimes overdubbing several instruments on the same recording track.
