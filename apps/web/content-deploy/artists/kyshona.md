## Biography
Kyshona Armstrong, known mononymously as Kyshona, was born and raised in Irmo, South Carolina, among the Gullah community, immersed in gospel, rhythm & blues, roots music, and as the granddaughter and daughter of gospel quartet players and singers. She initially studied piano for 15 years and classical oboe performance, later earning a degree in music therapy from the University of Georgia, where she also picked up guitar as part of her training. For over 17 years, she worked as a licensed music therapist with veterans, at-risk youth, incarcerated individuals, and those in mental health facilities, including leading a band called the Melotones in a forensics unit and a songwriting program in Davidson County Jail that produced the song 'I Am Enough.'[1][2][4][5]
