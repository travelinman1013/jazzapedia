## Biography
Eleni Mandell was born in Los Angeles, California, and began playing music at age 5½ with classical violin and piano lessons. She started guitar at 15, writing songs throughout her youth while exploring interests in acting, painting, and writing. As an art major at the University of California, Berkeley, she took creative writing classes influenced by professor Leonard Michaels, performed solo material reminiscent of PJ Harvey and Tom Waits, and drew early inspiration from classic American songwriting, show tunes, Nina Simone, country, punk, and pop. After graduating, she returned to California, where meeting musician Chuck E. Weiss—friend of Tom Waits and subject of Rickie Lee Jones's 'Chuck E.'s in Love'—became pivotal; he mentored her, encouraging her solo career and helping produce her self-released debut album *Wishbone* in 1998.[1][3][7][8]

Mandell signed with Toronto's independent Zedtone label, releasing *Thrill* (2000), *Snakebite* (2001), *Country for True Lovers* (2003), *Afternoon* (2004), and *Miracle of Five* (2007), blending torch songs, noir Americana, jazz, blues, soul, and country in a style likened to a sultrier Neko Case. She toured with Tom Waits's drummer Andrew Berger and others, formed side projects like The Grabs (2005 pop-rock album *Sex, Fashion, and Money*) and The Living Sisters (2007 vocal trio with Inara George and Becky Stark), and licensed songs for TV and commercials. Co-producing her tenth album *Dark Lights Up* (inspired by a Country Music Hall of Fame visit and Roger Miller) with Sheldon Gomberg in 2017, she recorded live with acoustic instruments, reflecting her evolution toward personal, exploratory sounds including jazz and French pop while balancing motherhood and touring.[1][2][4][5]

Mandell's independent career spans over two decades, earning critical acclaim for 'rainy day music' and emotional depth without major-label pressure, allowing creative freedom. Her work has appeared on shows like *Six Feet Under*, and she maintains integrity as an underground LA artist, evolving from gritty alt-country to intimate, vignette-driven portraits of love, regret, and hope.[1][3][4][5]
