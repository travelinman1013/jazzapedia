## Biography
Martin Taylor, MBE, born on 20 October 1956 in Harlow, Essex, England, grew up in a musical family with a Gypsy tradition; his father, jazz bassist William 'Buck' Taylor, introduced him to the guitar at age four and played music from the Quintette du Hot Club de France, inspiring him with Django Reinhardt. Completely self-taught, Taylor joined his father's band at eight and quit school at 15 to play professionally in holiday camps, on radio, cruise ships, and even with the Count Basie orchestra. Through jazz guitarist Ike Isaacs, his mentor, he refined his fingerstyle technique and jazz harmony, leading to his first recording in 1978 with bassist Peter Ind.

From 1979 to 1990, Taylor toured worldwide and recorded over 20 albums with Stéphane Grappelli, the legendary violinist of the Quintette du Hot Club de France, occupying the guitar role once held by Reinhardt; their album 'Together At Last' with Vassar Clements earned a 1987 Grammy nomination. Transitioning to solo work to gain independence, his 1992 album 'Artistry,' produced by Steve Howe, topped HMV Jazz Charts for 12 weeks, launching his international solo career. He released successful albums like 'Kiss and Tell' and 'Nitelife' on Sony/Columbia, formed the Django Reinhardt-inspired band Spirit of Django in 1994, and later founded the Martin Taylor Guitar Academy online in 2010, spanning over five decades with more than 100 recordings.[1][2][3][4]

Renowned for his virtuoso fingerstyle acoustic guitar playing—providing bass, chords, and melody simultaneously—Taylor's innovative style draws from jazz, Gypsy swing, and Reinhardt's influence, earning praise from Grappelli as 'a great artist, rich in talent and elegance.' Now based in Scotland, he has received awards including an MBE in 2002 for services to music, a 2001 British Jazz Award for Best Guitarist, and an honorary doctorate in 1999, cementing his legacy as one of the world's foremost acoustic guitarists.[1][2][4]

## Fun Facts
- Nearly sold his last guitar—a gift from mentor Ike Isaacs—due to financial despair after label troubles, but a final play in his car reignited his passion, calling off the deal and sparking his solo career.[2]
- Longest-serving guitarist with Stéphane Grappelli, surpassing even Django Reinhardt's tenure, over 11 years and 20+ albums.[5]
- Relocated to Scotland after Grappelli, leading to his label deal with Linn Records (a high-end audio company) whose equipment showcased his intricate tone; sometimes called Scottish despite English birth.[2][4]
- Launched the Martin Taylor Guitar Academy online in 2010, now with students in 58 countries, featured on NPR, BBC, and LA Times.[1][3]
