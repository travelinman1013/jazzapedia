## Biography
Hopeton Lewis was born on October 3, 1947, in Kingston, Jamaica, though some sources mention Montego Bay; he lost his mother at age two and was raised by various relatives. Singing in church from an early age, he formed a youth singing group called the Regals and began performing as a young artist. His rich baritone voice became prominent in Jamaican music during the mid-1960s transition from ska to rocksteady[1][2][4][5][7].

At age 19, Lewis recorded 'Take It Easy' in 1966 at Federal Records in Kingston with guitarist Lynn Taitt and the Jets, a track widely regarded as one of the first rocksteady songs due to its slower tempo, marking a pivotal shift toward reggae. He worked as an arranger for producer Duke Reid, scoring hits like 'Sounds and Pressure,' 'Cool Collie' (an early herb-themed tune), 'Tom Drunk' with U-Roy, 'Boom Shaka Laka' (1970 Festival Song winner), and 'Grooving Out on Life' in 1971 as lead singer with Byron Lee and the Dragonaires. He also collaborated on 'The Right Track' with Phyllis Dillon[1][2][3].

Lewis's output slowed after the early 1970s, but he continued recording sporadically. In the early 1990s, as a born-again Christian, he shifted to gospel music, releasing albums like 'This is Gospel,' '(1966),' and 'Reaching Out to Jesus' in 2000. He passed away on September 4, 2014, at age 66 in his Brooklyn, New York home, leaving a legacy as a rocksteady pioneer whose work bridged ska, rocksteady, reggae, and gospel[1][2].
