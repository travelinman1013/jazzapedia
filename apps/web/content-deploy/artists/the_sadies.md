## Biography
The Sadies are a Canadian rock and roll and country band formed in Toronto, Ontario, in 1995 by brothers Dallas Good and Travis Good, sons of folk and country musician Bruce Good and nephews of The Good Brothers—Canadian Country Music Hall of Fame inductees Larry and Brian Good. Raised in a musical family immersed in country traditions but secretly influenced by punk rock, the brothers started the band after Dallas's time in the post-punk group Phonocomb. Initially a rough rock outfit with Sloan drummer Andrew Scott, Travis joined to infuse traditional country elements, evolving into a quartet with drummer Mike Belitsky (ex-Jale, Pernice Brothers) and upright bassist Sean Dean.[1][2][3][7]

The band's sound fuses alt-country, surf guitar, garage-rock, psychedelic pop, spaghetti western influences from Ennio Morricone, and Byrds-style California country, starting as mostly instrumental on their 1998 Bloodshot Records debut *Precious Moments*, produced by Steve Albini. They gained recognition touring with Neko Case (as her backing band), releasing albums like *Red Dirt* (1999, with Andre Williams), *Stories Often Told* (2002, Yep Roc), and *Favourite Colours* (2004), while collaborating widely and accepting the alt-country label despite its limitations. Their music matured with Dallas's songwriting, blending punk attitude with deep roots.[1][2][3][4][5]

Over 25 years, The Sadies became one of North America's premier live bands, backing Neil Young (2010 onward), touring with Randy Bachman, and contributing to soundtracks and diverse sessions, culminating in acclaimed works like *Colder Streams*. Dallas Good's passing marked a poignant chapter, but their legacy endures through versatile mastery and genre-transcending innovation.[3][6][7][8]

## Fun Facts
- The Good brothers fought constantly since childhood, but Travis noted this tension added a valuable 'edge' to their music.[1]
- They never intended to be an instrumental band but were labeled as such after *Precious Moments* release, with Dallas saying it was 'too late to do anything about it.'[1]
- The Sadies' skills were compared to The Band, noting unparalleled breadth since Torontonians left Ronnie Hawkins to back Bob Dylan in the 1960s.[2]
- They composed soundtracks for documentaries like *Tales of the Rat Fink* about Big Daddy Roth and one on Carmine Street Guitars in NYC.[5]
