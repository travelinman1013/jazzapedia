## Biography
Edward Otha 'Eddie' South (1904–1962) was born on November 27, 1904, in Louisiana, Missouri, and raised in Chicago, where his prodigious violin talent emerged early. A classical prodigy, he studied at the Chicago College of Music under violinist Petrowitsch Bissing and later at the Paris Conservatoire, but racial barriers in the 1920s prevented a classical career, leading him to jazz and vaudeville. He began performing with Chicago ensembles like Freddie Keppard's group, Jimmy Wade's Syncopators, Charles Elgar's Creole Orchestra, and Erskine Tate's orchestra from 1923 to 1927.[1][2][4]

In 1927, South formed his own band, Eddie South and his Alabamians, playing at Chicago's Alabam club, and toured Europe from 1928 to 1930 with pianist Henry Crowder, where exposure to Hungarian folk and Roma (Gypsy) music profoundly shaped his style, blending it with jazz improvisation—exemplified by his signature tune 'Hejre Kati.' Returning to the U.S. in 1931, he led bands featuring bassist Milt Hinton, recorded sporadically, and revisited Europe in the 1930s to collaborate with Django Reinhardt, Stéphane Grappelli, and Michel Warlop. He later joined Earl Hines' big band (1947–1949) and performed in New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago, though commercial success eluded him in America due to racism.[1][2][3][4]

South's warm, lyrical sound spanned swing, gypsy jazz, and Latin influences, earning acclaim in Europe but obscurity elsewhere. One of the earliest jazz violinists (recording from 1923), his technical brilliance prefigured the Hot Club de France style. He continued recording for labels like Chess, Mercury, and Trip into the 1950s, dying in Chicago on April 25, 1962, remembered as the greatest formally educated Black violinist of his era.[2][3][4]
