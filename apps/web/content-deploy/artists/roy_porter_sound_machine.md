## Biography
Roy Porter, born Roy Lee Porter on July 30, 1923, in Walsenburg, Colorado, began his musical journey in Colorado Springs at age eight, playing drums in rhythm and blues bands as a teenager. He briefly attended Wiley College in Texas alongside trumpeter Kenny Dorham before joining Milt Larkin's band in 1943. After military service, he settled in Los Angeles, where he became a key figure in early bebop, recording with Howard McGhee and backing Charlie Parker on Dial classics like 'A Night in Tunisia' and 'Yardbird Suite' in 1946. Porter performed on Central Avenue with bebop luminaries such as Dexter Gordon, Wardell Gray, and Teddy Edwards, and later organized a big band featuring Art Farmer, Jimmy Knepper, and Eric Dolphy.

During the 1950s, Porter's career was interrupted by drug problems and incarceration, leading to a period of inactivity in jazz. Upon release in the 1970s, he reinvented himself in the jazz-funk genre, founding the Roy Porter Sound Machine, a heavyweight combo emphasizing raw rhythms, bluesy grooves, beefy bass, electric piano, fuzzy guitars, and brass arrangements. Their 1971 debut album 'Jessica' stands out as a rare and magnificent jazz-funk/funk fusion masterpiece, followed by recordings through 1975 that blended his bebop roots with funky, floor-ready energy.

Porter's legacy bridges bebop's golden era and 1970s jazz-funk innovation, showcasing resilience after personal struggles. He passed away on January 24, 1998, in Los Angeles, leaving a discography that highlights his versatile drumming and bandleading prowess.
