## Biography
Caterina Germaine Maria Valente was born on 14 January 1931 in Paris, France, to Italian parents, and passed away on 9 September 2024 at age 93. Growing up in a musical family, she began performing as a teenager, playing guitar in an orchestra and developing skills as a singer, dancer, and guitarist. Fluent in six languages and capable of singing in thirteen, she started her professional career in the early 1950s, auditioning successfully with bandleader Kurt Edelhagen in 1953, who called her the most musical woman he had ever heard. Her breakthrough came in 1955 with the massive hit 'Ganz Paris träumt von der Liebe' (a German version of 'I Love Paris'), selling over 500,000 copies initially, followed by 'Malaguena' which gained traction in the US.[1][2][3]
