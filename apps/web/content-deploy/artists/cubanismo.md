## Biography
¡Cubanismo! is a Cuban music ensemble led by trumpeter Jesús Alemañy, born October 14, 1962, in Guanabacoa, Havana, Cuba.[1] Alemañy began his musical education at age 13 at the Conservatoire Guillermo Tomas in Guanabacoa, studying trumpet, solfege, and music theory.[1] He gained early professional experience as a trumpeter for the legendary son group Sierra Maestra starting at age 15 in 1978, where he performed until 1992.[1][2] After leaving Cuba for London in 1992 to pursue his own musical identity, Alemañy collaborated with producer Nick Gold and others to conceptualize ¡Cubanismo! as a recording project that would modernize the traditional rhythms of Cuba's horn-driven bands from the 1950s.[1][2]

The eponymous debut album ¡Cubanismo! was officially released on February 27, 1996, on Hannibal/Rykodisc, featuring a fourteen-piece ensemble of top Cuban musicians.[1] The album achieved significant commercial and critical success, reaching the top ten lists of Billboard, Latin Beat, and Afropop Worldwide.[1][2] The project's success led Alemañy and the musicians to continue working together as a permanent ensemble rather than a one-shot collaboration.[1] Subsequent albums including Melembe (1997) and Reencarnación (1998) solidified the band's position as one of Havana's premier exports.[1] The group made its historic first U.S. tour in 1997, a watershed moment when top Cuban bands penetrated political barriers to perform on American soil for the first time since Castro's rise to power.[4] Later projects expanded the band's musical palette, including collaborations with American and Jamaican musicians, such as the Mardi Gras Mambo recording with New Orleans musicians and reggae interpretations featuring Ernest Ranglin and Luciano.[2]

## Fun Facts
- ¡Cubanismo! began as a one-shot recording project with no intention of becoming a permanent ensemble, but the album's success was so significant that the musicians agreed to continue working together.[1]
- The band's 1997 U.S. tour was historically significant as it marked one of the first times top Cuban bands were able to perform on American soil since Fidel Castro's rise to power, breaking through decades of political barriers.[4]
- In addition to their Cuban music focus, ¡Cubanismo! expanded into cross-cultural fusion projects, including a collaboration with New Orleans musicians on 'Mardi Gras Mambo' and reggae reinterpretations of Bob Marley songs featuring Jamaican artists.[2]
- The band performed at prestigious venues including the Jazz Café in London, where critics particularly praised their interpretation of Bob Marley's 'Could You Be Loved,' which later appeared on a compilation album.[2]
