## Biography
Roger Kynard 'Roky' Erickson (July 15, 1947 – May 31, 2019) was an American musician and singer-songwriter from Austin, Texas, widely regarded as an 'outsider genius' and pioneer of psychedelic rock. He showed early musical talent, playing piano from age five and guitar from ten, writing songs like 'You're Gonna Miss Me' at 15 with his first band, the Spades. Dropping out of Travis High School in 1965 to avoid cutting his hair, he co-founded the 13th Floor Elevators with Tommy Hall, releasing their debut album *The Psychedelic Sounds of the 13th Floor Elevators* in 1966, featuring the proto-punk hit 'You're Gonna Miss Me.' The band's acid rock sound, driven by Erickson's intense vocals and Hall's electric jug, ignited the garage rock and psychedelic movements.[1][2][5]

Erickson's career was derailed in 1969 by a marijuana possession arrest; pleading insanity to avoid prison, he endured years of electroshock therapy and Thorazine at Rusk State Hospital, emerging profoundly affected by mental illness. Post-release in the mid-1970s, he recorded solo singles like 'Red Temple Prayer (Two Headed Dog)' with Doug Sahm's help and formed Roky Erickson and the Aliens, releasing influential albums *Roky Erickson and the Aliens* (1980) and *The Evil One* (1981). His music blended horror themes, raw energy, and psychedelic experimentation. In the 2000s, brother Sumner gained custody, stabilizing his life with medication; he resumed performing, collaborating with bands like the Black Angels and Okkervil River on *True Love Cast Out All Evil* (2010), and reunited with the Elevators in 2015.[1][3][4][5]

Erickson's legacy endures as a proto-punk and psych-rock icon, influencing generations despite personal struggles. He performed at major festivals like Coachella (2007) and Levitation (2015), remarried his ex-wife Dana, and reconnected with son Jegar, who became his road manager, symbolizing remarkable recovery.[1][4]
