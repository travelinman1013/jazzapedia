## Biography
Michael Peter Balzary, professionally known as Flea, was born on October 16, 1962, in Melbourne, Australia, and moved to Los Angeles as a child. Introduced to rock music by Hillel Slovak and punk rock by Anthony Kiedis, Flea initially learned trumpet from his jazz trumpeter father before switching to bass at Slovak's suggestion, performing on stage just two weeks later. He played in early bands like Anthym and the punk outfit Fear before co-founding the Red Hot Chili Peppers (RHCP) in 1983 with Kiedis, Slovak, and Jack Sherman, marking the start of his influential career blending funk, punk, psychedelia, and hard rock.[1][2][3]

Flea's tenure with RHCP spans their debut album in 1984 through mainstream successes like Mother's Milk (1989) and Blood Sugar Sex Magik (1991), navigating lineup changes, hiatuses, and personal challenges including substance issues. His aggressive slap bass and fingerstyle techniques propelled hits, earning him the #2 spot on Rolling Stone's reader poll for best bassists in 2009 and a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction in 2012. Beyond RHCP, Flea collaborated extensively in the 1990s on over 40 records and pursued acting in films like Back to the Future Part II and The Big Lebowski, while recent projects include Atoms for Peace with Thom Yorke and contributions to Tom Waits' Bad as Me (2011).[1][2]

Flea's legacy as a bass legend lies in his energetic, funk-rooted style using pentatonic scales and playing ahead of the beat, evolving from explosive slap techniques to more mature expressions. RHCP's ongoing success, including albums like I'm with You (2011) and The Getaway (2016), underscores his enduring impact, complemented by his love of jazz and diverse side projects.[1][2][3]
