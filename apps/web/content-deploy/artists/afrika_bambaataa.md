## Biography
Lance Taylor, born April 17, 1957, in the Bronx, New York, rose to prominence as Afrika Bambaataa, a pioneering DJ, rapper, and producer in hip-hop's formative years. Initially a member and 'warlord' of the Black Spades gang in the early 1970s, he transitioned from gang violence by organizing block parties and breakdancing competitions around 1970-1976, drawing inspiration from DJs like Kool Herc and Disco King Mario. These events helped define hip-hop's four pillars—rapping, DJing, graffiti, and B-boying—and led him to repurpose his gang into the Universal Zulu Nation in the late 1970s, a socially conscious organization promoting peace, unity, love, and fun through hip-hop culture.

Bambaataa's career breakthrough came in 1980 with 'Zulu Nation Throwdown' by Soul Sonic Force, followed by the seminal 1982 hit 'Planet Rock,' an electro-funk track sampling Kraftwerk and using the Roland TR-808 drum machine, produced with Arthur Baker and John Robie. This gold-certified single birthed the electro-boogie subgenre and propelled hip-hop globally, including the first international hip-hop tour in 1982. Subsequent releases like 'Looking for the Perfect Beat' (1983), 'Renegades of Funk,' 'Unity' with James Brown (1984), and 'World Destruction' with John Lydon (1984) showcased his eclectic style blending funk, electronic music, and punk. He founded crews like Jazzy 5 and Soulsonic Force, worked with labels like Celluloid Records, and contributed to turntablism and electronica.

Bambaataa's legacy as the 'Master of Records' endures for globalizing hip-hop and fostering cultural unity, though he stepped down from leading the Universal Zulu Nation in 2016 amid historical abuse allegations. His innovative fusion of genres and commitment to hip-hop's positive values influenced generations worldwide.
