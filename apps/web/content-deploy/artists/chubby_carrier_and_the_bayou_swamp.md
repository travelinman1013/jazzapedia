## Biography
Roy 'Chubby' Carrier, Jr., born on July 1, 1967, in Church Point, Louisiana, hails from a legendary third-generation zydeco family, including his father Roy Carrier, grandfather Warren Carrier, and cousins Bebe and Calvin Carrier. He began his musical journey at age 12, playing drums with his father's band, The Carrier Brothers, making his debut at the American Legion Hall in Church Point without prior rehearsal. By age 15, he switched to accordion, and at 17, he joined Terrance Simien and the Mallet Playboys, touring worldwide for two and a half years, including a memorable State Department tour in North Africa.[1][3][4]

In 1989, with Terrance Simien's encouragement, Chubby formed Chubby Carrier and the Bayou Swamp Band, embarking on an ambitious mission to spread zydeco globally. The band toured extensively—up to 275 days a year—across the US (including Alaska and Hawaii), Canada, Europe, and North Africa, performing at major festivals like New Orleans Jazz & Heritage and Chicago Blues Festival, even before signing with labels. They recorded seven studio albums with Blind Pig and Flying Fish Records, often marketed as zydeco blues on blues circuits, before releasing albums on Chubby's own Swampadellic Records label. Their 2010 album *Zydeco Junkie* won a Grammy for Best Zydeco or Cajun Music Album, cementing their status.[1][2][3]

Known as the 'World’s Premier Zydeco Showman,' Chubby blends traditional zydeco with blues influences, emphasizing high-energy performances that ignite joy and promote Louisiana Creole culture. The band appeared in the 2016 stage production *Jambalaya, the Musical* in New Orleans and continues to tour 150-175 days annually, leaving audiences worldwide with smiles and a deeper appreciation for zydeco.[2][3][4]
