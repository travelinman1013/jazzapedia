## Biography
Armik, an Iranian-Armenian American guitarist, producer, and composer, was born in Iran to Armenian parents and displayed prodigious musical talent from a young age. At seven, he pawned his watch to buy a classical guitar, practicing secretly in his basement, and by age 12, he was a professional recording artist contributing to popular Iranian recordings for singers like Googoosh and Dariush. Initially focused on jazz guitar, his career pivoted dramatically in the 1970s during visits to Spain, where witnessing Paco de Lucía's performance ignited a lifelong passion for flamenco, prompting him to switch instruments and immerse himself in Spanish musical traditions.[1][2][5]

In 1981, Armik relocated to Los Angeles, working as a prolific session musician on over 10,000 recordings while teaching guitar to supplement his income. Supported by his wife Annette, he launched his solo career in 1994 with the album *Rain Dancer*, a critical and commercial success that blended his jazz roots with flamenco improvisation, Latin rhythms, and classical elements, pioneering the Nuevo Flamenco genre. His 1995 follow-up *Gypsy Flame* achieved gold status in Australia and charted on Billboard's Top New Age Albums, solidifying his reputation; subsequent releases like *Rubia* (1996, named after a custom guitar by luthier Pedro Maldonado), *Malaga* (1997), *Isla del Sol* (1999), and *Rosas del Amor* (2001) further showcased his virtuosic style.[1][2][5]

In 2002, Armik founded Bolero Records, releasing all subsequent albums that consistently charted in Billboard's Top 10 New Age spots. His music fuses Spanish guitar scales, flamenco passion, jazz, and Latin influences, earning worldwide acclaim. As of January 2025, his latest album *Gitano Amor* continues his prolific output, cementing his legacy as a leader in Nuevo Flamenco.[1][2]
