## Biography
J Balvin (José Álvaro Osorio Balvín, born May 7, 1985, in Medellín, Colombia) and Bad Bunny (Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, born March 10, 1994, in San Juan, Puerto Rico) are two leading figures in reggaeton and Latin trap music, known for their collaborative work that has propelled Latin music to global prominence. J Balvin rose to fame in 2014 with breakthrough singles like '6 AM' featuring Farruko, 'Ay Vamos,' and 'Ginza,' which topped Latin charts, followed by his 2016 album *Energía* featuring hits such as 'Bobo,' 'Safari,' and 'Sigo Extrañándote.' Bad Bunny began uploading tracks to SoundCloud in 2013 while working at a supermarket and studying at university; his 2016 single 'Diles' caught the attention of producer DJ Luian, leading to his signing with Hear This Music and rapid success with tracks like 'Soy Peor.' Their paths crossed in 2017 on 'Si Tu Novio Te Deja Sola,' setting the stage for deeper collaboration amid their shared genres of reggaeton and Latin urban music.[1][2][3]

The duo's partnership peaked with the surprise collaborative album *Oasis* on June 27, 2019, blending reggaeton, trap, and diverse influences, which earned a Grammy nomination for Best Latin Rock, Urban, or Alternative Album. They also joined Cardi B on the 2018 Billboard Hot 100 number-one 'I Like It,' marking J Balvin's first US #1 and diamond-certified hit, while showcasing Bad Bunny's bilingual rapping. J Balvin continued with albums like *Vibras* (2018), *Colores* (2020), *José* (2021), and *Rayo* (2024), breaking records with 33 No. 1s on Billboard Latin Airplay. Bad Bunny released genre-spanning albums including *X 100PRE* (2018, Latin Grammy winner), *YHLQMDLG* (2020, first Grammy win), and *Debí Tirar Más Fotos* (2025), achieving multiple Billboard 200 No. 1s while performing at the 2020 Super Bowl halftime show alongside J Balvin, Shakira, and Jennifer Lopez. Their styles fuse reggaeton rhythms with trap beats, Latin pop, and eclectic elements, prioritizing Spanish-language success globally.[1][2][3]

Their legacy lies in mainstreaming Latin urban music without compromising language or roots, influencing a new wave of artists and achieving unprecedented chart dominance. J Balvin's vibrant, colorful aesthetic and Bad Bunny's boundary-pushing individuality—marked by bold fashion and activism—have inspired global fandom, with Spotify popularity at 89 in reggaeton and Latin genres. Despite individual paths, their *Oasis* collaboration symbolizes the synergy driving Latin music's explosion.[1][2][3][4]
