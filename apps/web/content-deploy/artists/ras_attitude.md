## Biography
Ras Attitude, born M. Goodwin, is a roots reggae artist from St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands, who began his musical career in the 1990s. Raised in the church by his mother, gospel singer Harrella Goodwin, he was introduced to performance at age 7 and developed his musical foundation by teaching himself to read music and play keyboards. During his high school years at Caribbean Community School, he founded the Lunch Room Session to showcase local talent and co-founded Tek-9 Sounds with neighborhood friends. While attending Becker College, he was nicknamed "Attitude" by Tippa Lee of Tippa Lee & Rappa Roberts, and there he met Ras Batch, with whom he would create Sound V.I.Zion Records.

Ras Attitude's professional recording career launched with his debut album "Happiness" in 2001, establishing him as a soulful roots reggae vocalist with a smooth, magnetic delivery. Over the following two decades, he maintained a prolific output, releasing seven albums within twelve years, including "Love Life" (2004), "Holding Firm" (2005), "Royal Lionage" (2006), "Trodding Home" (2007), "I Meditation" (2009), and "Hold The Vibes" (2012). His versatility spans reggae, R&B, hip-hop, and pop, with notable tracks including "War To Win," "All We Need is Love," and "Wrath of Jah" featuring Ras Batch. His later work "Warrior Status," released through Boondox Records in association with Partii Animalz Entertainment, showcased his continued artistic evolution and commitment to messages of pride, heritage, and social consciousness.

Throughout his career, Ras Attitude has established himself as one of the Virgin Islands' most significant reggae voices, known for his spiritual delivery, self-assured stage presence, and commitment to themes of love, unity, and positivity. His influence extends across the reggae diaspora, having performed extensively throughout the United States and Europe alongside legendary artists and maintaining his artistic integrity across two decades of recording.
