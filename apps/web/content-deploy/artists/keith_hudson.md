## Biography
Keith Hudson (March 18, 1946 – November 14, 1984) was a Jamaican reggae singer, songwriter, and pioneering producer born in Kingston at Jubilee Hospital, where he grew up in a musical family alongside future stars like Bob Marley and Delroy Wilson. Initially working as a dental technician to fund his passion, Hudson avoided Kingston's gang culture and entered the music industry in the late 1960s by producing hits like Ken Boothe's 'Old Fashioned Way.' He founded independent labels such as Imbidimts, Mafia, and Joint International, pioneering an album-oriented approach with thematic, narrative-driven works that blended roots reggae, rocksteady, and dub, earning him the nickname 'Dark Prince of Reggae' for his moody, echo-laden soundscapes.[1][2][3][4]

Hudson's career peaked in the 1970s with landmark albums like *Pick a Dub* (1974), one of the first fully thematic dub records, and *Flesh of My Skin, Blood of My Blood* (1974), reggae's first true concept album exploring black history and conscious themes, recorded between Kingston and London. He shifted focus to his rasping vocals from 1972, releasing *Furnace* (1972), *Class and Subject*, and later UK efforts like *Torch of Freedom* before moving to New York in 1976, where a Virgin Records deal yielded the poorly received soul-funk *Too Expensive* (1976) and roots classic *Rasta Communication* (1978). Emigrating for wider reach, he collaborated with top session musicians but faced commercial challenges as dancehall rose in the 1980s.[2][3][4]

Hudson died of lung cancer at age 38 in 1984, underappreciated in his time despite his visionary influence on dub and roots reggae. His work with stark rhythms, reverb, and political depth left a haunting legacy, revered by connoisseurs for pushing reggae beyond singles into conceptual artistry.[1][2][4]
