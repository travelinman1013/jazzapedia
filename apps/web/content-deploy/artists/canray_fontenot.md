## Biography
Canray Fontenot (October 16, 1922 – July 29, 1995) was an American Creole fiddle player hailed as "the greatest Creole Louisiana French fiddler of our time."[1] Born in L'Anse Aux Vaches, Louisiana, Fontenot grew up in a musically rich household as the son of legendary accordionist Adam Fontenot. He began his musical journey at age nine by constructing a cigar box fiddle using discarded strings from other musicians, inspired by his cousin Douglas Belair, one of the first recorded Black fiddle players.[4] Around age 11, his uncle purchased him his first real fiddle, and he began performing at area dances and weddings alongside his father and the renowned accordionist Amédé Ardoin.

Fontenot's professional career flourished after forming the Duralde Ramblers with Ardoin in 1948, becoming highly popular in southwest Louisiana through radio broadcasts on KEUN in Eunice during the 1950s.[1] The pair made their breakthrough outside Louisiana in 1966 when they performed at the Newport Folk Festival, launching a 40-year partnership that took them across the United States and internationally.[3] Fontenot's fiddle technique was legendary, characterized by loose, Caribbean-style bowing and a distinctive approach that blended traditional Black Creole repertoire with his innovative "blues-waltzes," combining blues tonalities, jazz improvisation, and Cajun modal scales.[3] His original compositions, including "Joe Pitre a Deux Femmes," "Les Barres de la Prison," and "Bonsoir Moreau," became standards in Cajun and Zydeco music.[1]

Fontenot received the National Heritage Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts in 1986, the United States government's highest honor in folk and traditional arts, and was appointed an adjunct professor at the University of Southwestern Louisiana the same year.[1] He was featured in numerous documentaries on Cajun and Creole culture, including the 1989 film *J'ai Ete au Bal* and PBS's *American Patchwork: Don't Drop the Potato*.[1] Fontenot died of cancer on July 29, 1995, in Welsh, Louisiana, leaving behind a legacy as one of the last players of pre-zydeco Creole music and a transformative figure in Louisiana's musical traditions.[6]

## Fun Facts
- At age nine, Canray constructed his first fiddle from a cigar box using discarded strings collected from other fiddle players' trash, demonstrating his resourcefulness and passion for music before receiving his first real violin at age 11.[4]
- Canray had such a remarkable memory for venues that decades later, when traveling to Carnegie Hall, he immediately recognized it and recalled performing there previously with Bois Sec Ardoin, slapping his knee and saying, "yeah, this is the place. We played here before!"[4]
- Clifton Chenier, the legendary "king of Zydeco," personally pulled Canray out of a seven-year performance hiatus, recognizing him as the best fiddler and helping revive his career.[2]
- Canray held BMI copyrights on 59 original compositions, many of which became standards in both Cajun and Zydeco music repertoires, ensuring his creative legacy extended far beyond his own performances.[2]
