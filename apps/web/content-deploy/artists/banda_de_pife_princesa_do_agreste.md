## Biography
Banda de Pife Princesa do Agreste is a traditional Brazilian pife band originating from Caruaru, Pernambuco, in the Agreste region, specializing in the folk music of Northeast Brazil. The group is closely associated with Biu do Pife, an experienced musician with over 50 years of career by 2008, deeply rooted in Caruaru's musical traditions. Pife bands like this one feature the pífano (a type of fife or flute), a key instrument in regional forró and festivo music, often performed at cultural events and festas juninas[1][2].

Biu do Pife recorded notable work in 1976 under the monitoring of Jackson do Pandeiro, a legendary figure in Brazilian forró and baião music, marking an important early milestone in the band's or musician's trajectory. The band has been featured in media through labels like Selo Mundo Melhor, with performances documented online dating back around 8 years from uploads in circa 2018. Princesa do Agreste reflects the vibrant pife culture of Pernambuco, contributing to the preservation of traditional sounds amid modern influences[1][2].

While detailed career arcs are sparse in available records, the band's legacy endures through its role in sustaining Northeast Brazilian folk traditions, as evidenced by ongoing cultural documentation and low-profile digital presence on platforms like YouTube and WOMEX[1][2].
