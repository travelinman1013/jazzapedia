## Biography
Antonio Carlos Jobim, affectionately known as Tom Jobim, was born on January 25, 1927, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to cultured parents—his father a diplomat and his mother a primary school founder. Growing up amid Rio's vibrant beaches and landscapes, he studied piano and harmony, drawing influences from classical composers like Debussy and Ravel, as well as Brazilian musicians such as Pixinguinha. In the 1940s, he began playing piano in Rio's bars and nightclubs, and by the early 1950s, he worked as an arranger at Continental Studio, where his first composition, 'Incerteza,' was recorded in 1953.[1][2][3]
