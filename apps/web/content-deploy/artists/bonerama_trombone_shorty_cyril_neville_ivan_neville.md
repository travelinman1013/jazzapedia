## Biography
Troy 'Trombone Shorty' Andrews, born January 2, 1986, in New Orleans' Tremé neighborhood, began playing trombone at age four with an instrument larger than himself, earning his lifelong nickname. A child prodigy from a musical family as one of seven children of James Andrews Jr. and Lois Andrews, he performed semi-professionally that year with Bo Diddley at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival and led his own Tiny Toones Brass Band by age six, marching in Jackson Square for tips. He honed his skills in street parades, clubs, and at the New Orleans Center for Creative Arts (NOCCA), mastering trombone, trumpet, tuba, drums, guitar, organ, and more while absorbing New Orleans brass band traditions, funk, and jazz.[1][2][3][4][5][6]

As a teenager, Andrews played with the Stooges Brass Band, joined Lenny Kravitz's touring band post-NOCCA graduation in 2005, and contributed to post-Hurricane Katrina efforts with the New Orleans Social Club. In 2006, he worked with U2 at Abbey Road Studios and performed at the Louisiana Superdome reopening with U2 and Green Day. Forming Trombone Shorty & Orleans Avenue, he blended jazz, funk, rock, hip-hop, and second-line rhythms, achieving breakthroughs with albums like Backatown (2010), For True (2011), Say That to Say This (2013), and Parking Lot Symphony (2017), the latter topping Billboard's Jazz chart. His style reveres New Orleans roots while innovating across genres.[1][3][5][6]

Andrews' legacy includes the Trombone Shorty Foundation (2011), providing instruments, the Trombone Shorty Music Academy, and Shorty Fest, alongside collaborations with The Meters. An internationally acclaimed artist, he received the 21st Heinz Award in Arts and Humanities, co-authored a children's book autobiography, and continues as a bandleader, educator, and ambassador for New Orleans music.[2][3]
