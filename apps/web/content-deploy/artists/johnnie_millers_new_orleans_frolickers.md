## Biography
Johnny Miller was a pianist active in the New Orleans jazz scene during the 1920s, leading the band Johnny Miller's New Orleans Frolickers. The group performed at venues like the Fralick and was part of the city's vibrant traditional jazz tradition, recording sides that captured the hot jazz style prevalent among white New Orleans ensembles. Their music reflected the collective improvisation and rhythmic drive characteristic of early jazz bands from the region.[1][3][5]

The Frolickers emerged in the mid-to-late 1920s, with Miller at the piano, alongside notable musicians from the local scene. They recorded tracks such as their version of 'Panama' in New Orleans around 1928, featuring innovative intros and ensemble playing that showcased the band's energy. The group operated during a transitional period when many New Orleans musicians were recording and touring, though the Frolickers remained primarily local.[1][3][5]

Little is documented about Miller's early life or later career, but his band's recordings contribute to the legacy of New Orleans jazz, preserving the style amid the shift toward larger swing ensembles. Their work exemplifies the frolicking, dance-oriented jazz of the era, influencing the preservation of traditional sounds.[1][2][5]
