## Biography
Ferdinand Joseph LaMothe, known professionally as Jelly Roll Morton, was born around 1890 in New Orleans, Louisiana, to parents of Louisiana Creole descent. He learned piano as a child and by 1902 was performing professionally in the bordellos of New Orleans' Storyville district, pioneering ragtime piano while blending it with emerging jazz elements like improvisation and the 'Spanish tinge'—a rhythmic influence from Caribbean music. Morton toured extensively across the U.S. South with minstrel shows, worked in vaudeville, and held various jobs including gambler and pimp, all while composing early jazz standards such as 'Jelly Roll Blues' (published 1915), 'King Porter Stomp,' and 'Frog-I-More Rag.' His style marked a key transition from ragtime to orchestral jazz, emphasizing prearranged arrangements that preserved improvisation's spirit.

In 1917, Morton moved to California, performing in nightclubs until 1922, then relocated to Chicago in 1923, launching his recording career with solo piano sides and leading his group, Jelly Roll Morton and His Red Hot Peppers. From 1926 to 1930, the Red Hot Peppers produced landmark recordings like 'Black Bottom Stomp' and 'The Pearls,' gaining national fame for their structured yet improvisational sound, more formal than Dixieland. Moving to New York in 1928, his popularity waned by the early 1930s amid the rise of Louis Armstrong and swing. In 1938, Library of Congress recordings with Alan Lomax captured his musical demonstrations and life stories, revitalizing interest before his death in Los Angeles on July 10, 1941.

Morton's legacy lies in proving jazz could be notated while retaining its improvisational essence, as the first major jazz arranger and composer. His innovations influenced the shift to big band jazz, with compositions like 'King Porter Stomp' becoming swing standards, cementing his role as a foundational figure despite his exaggerated claim of 'inventing jazz' in 1902.

## Fun Facts
