## Biography
The Soul Stirrers, an American gospel music group, were formed around 1926 in Trinity, Texas, by Roy Crain (also known as S.R. Crain or Silas Roy Crain), initially as a jubilee-style quartet named the Mount Pleasant Green Singers before adopting the name 'Soul Stirrers' after a parishioner described their singing as soul-stirring.[1][2][3] In the early 1930s, Crain joined an existing group in Houston and brought in R.H. (Rebert) Harris as musical leader in 1931 or 1937, pioneering the dual-lead style with one high crooning voice and one low shouting voice, influenced by hard gospel singers like Mahalia Jackson and Sister Rosetta Tharpe.[2][3][4] They moved to Chicago in 1936, becoming the first gospel group to tour professionally, charging admission and traveling full-time, and were recorded by Alan Lomax for the Library of Congress in 1936.[2][3][4][6]

The group signed with Specialty Records in 1950, releasing hits like 'By and By' and 'In That Awful Hour,' but Harris left later that year due to dissatisfaction with the music business.[1][3] He was replaced by 19-year-old Sam Cooke in January 1951, who had sung with the Highway QCs; Cooke's smooth lead on tracks like 'Jesus Gave Me Water' elevated their fame, attracting rock and roll audiences including the Drifters, B.B. King, and Ray Charles, though Cooke stayed only until 1956-1957 before pursuing secular pop.[1][2][3] Key members during this peak included Paul Foster, Jesse Farley, S.R. Crain, R.B. Robinson, and LeRoy Crume, who was the last original member still singing.[2] After Cooke, Johnnie Taylor briefly sustained success, but the group's preeminence waned.[3]

Pioneers in quartet gospel, the Soul Stirrers influenced soul, R&B, doo-wop, and Southern soul over a career spanning more than 90 years until around 1990, reshaping traditional material into rhythmic modern gospel that bridged sacred and secular music.[1][3][4][8]
