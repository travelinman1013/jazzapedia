## Biography
Will Batts was born on January 24, 1904, in Michigan, Mississippi, a small community in the Mississippi Delta region known for its rich blues heritage. Initially working as a farm hand, he transitioned to a full-time music career, becoming a talented fiddler specializing in pre-war country blues, acoustic Memphis blues, and jug band styles.[1][3][5] His early life in rural Mississippi shaped his raw, authentic sound rooted in the Delta blues tradition.

Batts rose to prominence as the primary instrumentalist in Jack Kelly's South Memphis Jug Band during the 1930s, contributing fiddle to their recordings and performances that captured the jug band craze of the era.[4][5] He recorded tracks like 'Country Woman,' showcasing his skillful fiddle work alongside jug, guitar, and banjo in the lively, rhythmic style of Memphis jug bands.[3] His career centered on live performances and limited recordings during the pre-war blues period, embodying the itinerant musician life of the time.[1][2]

Will Batts passed away in 1956 (with some sources noting 1954), leaving a modest but influential legacy in early blues history, particularly as a fiddler bridging jug band and Memphis blues traditions.[1][4][5] Though not a mainstream figure, his contributions are preserved through reissues and blues historiography, highlighting the instrumental diversity of pre-war Southern blues.
