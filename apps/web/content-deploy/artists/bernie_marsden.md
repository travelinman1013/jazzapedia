## Biography
Bernard John Marsden (7 May 1951 – 24 August 2023) was born in Buckingham, England, where he developed a passion for blues music in his early teens, influenced by legends like Howlin' Wolf and Muddy Waters. His formative years aligned with the British blues boom, drawing inspiration from guitarists such as Peter Green, Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, and Jimi Hendrix, which fueled his ambition to become a professional musician. Marsden secured his first professional gig with UFO in 1972, followed by stints in Glenn Cornick's Wild Turkey (1973), Cozy Powell's Hammer, Babe Ruth (1975-1976, contributing to *Stealin' Home* and *Kid's Stuff*), and Paice Ashton Lord (1977, with Deep Purple's Jon Lord and Ian Paice).[1][2][3]

In 1978, Marsden co-founded Whitesnake with David Coverdale and Micky Moody, marking his breakthrough. Over four years, he played on key albums including *Snakebite* (1978), *Trouble* (1978), *Lovehunter* (1979), *Ready an' Willing* (1980), *Live... in the Heart of the City* (1980), *Come an' Get It* (1981), and *Saints & Sinners* (1982), co-writing hits like 'Fool for Your Loving,' 'Walking in the Shadow of the Blues,' and 'Here I Go Again.' His melodic, emotive blues-rock style—featuring masterful string bends, vibrato, and storytelling solos—blended blues roots with rock elements. After leaving Whitesnake in 1982 due to management conflicts, he pursued a prolific solo career, releasing 23 albums, including *Green and Blues* (1994, tribute to John Mayall's Bluesbreakers), *Shine* (2014, with guests like Coverdale and Joe Bonamassa), and reunited with Moody in The Moody Marsden Band (1989-1994).[1][2][4]

Marsden's legacy endures as 'British blues-rock’s secret weapon,' praised by Joe Bonamassa as 'the best of the best.' A noted guitar collector, he released his autobiography *Where's My Guitar?* in 2017 (updated 2019), chronicling tours with AC/DC, friendships like George Harrison, and life on the road. His influence on modern blues guitarists persists through his emotive phrasing and blues devotion.[1][2][5]
