## Biography
John Laird Abercrombie, born December 16, 1944, in Port Chester, New York, and raised in Greenwich, Connecticut, began playing guitar at age 12 or 14 on a cheap Harmony guitar that he later used as a baseball bat. Initially inspired by rock and roll figures like Chuck Berry, The Ventures, and Elvis Presley, he played in a quirky first band featuring mariachi and polka music with accordion, drums, maracas, harmonica, and trumpet. Introduced to jazz through Barney Kessel by a local teacher, he pursued formal studies at Berklee College of Music starting in 1962, studying under Herb Pomeroy and Jack Peterson, alongside peers like a young Keith Jarrett. Influenced deeply by Jim Hall's playing on Sonny Rollins' *The Bridge*, Abercrombie left Berklee without graduating around 1969 and moved to New York, gigging in R&B with the Danny White Orchestra and organ trios led by Johnny 'Hammond' Smith, where he subbed for George Benson on his first recording, *Nasty!* in 1968.[1][4][5][6][7]

Abercrombie rose in the jazz fusion scene, joining the Brecker Brothers and Billy Cobham in the horn-driven band Dreams, and later Chico Hamilton's group, which had previously featured Jim Hall and John Pisano. A pivotal break came via Jack DeJohnette, leading to his ECM debut *Timeless* (1975) with DeJohnette and Jan Hammer, followed by *Sargasso Sea* (1976) with Ralph Towner. He formed the influential Gateway trio with DeJohnette and Dave Holland, releasing albums in 1975 and 1978, and later trios with Marc Johnson and Peter Erskine, experimenting with guitar synthesizers for louder, propulsive sounds. Over 40 years with ECM, he recorded over 30 leader albums and 20 as sideman, defining the label's contemplative, atmospheric 'ECM sound' through post-bop, fusion, free jazz, and avant-garde explorations, often innovating tone with fuzztones, synths, and eventually thumb-picking in the style of Wes Montgomery.[1][2][3][5][6]

In his later career, Abercrombie led quartets with Richie Beirach, George Mraz, and Peter Donald, and released *Up and Coming* (2017) with Marc Copland, Drew Gress, and Joey Baron. He suffered a stroke later in life and died of heart failure on August 22, 2017, at age 72 in his New York home, leaving a legacy as a pioneering fusion guitarist who blended rock energy, jazz harmony, and ambient textures, influencing generations through his ECM association and experimental approach.[1][2][3][7]

## Fun Facts
- Abercrombie's first guitar, a $40 Harmony bought at age 12, ended up being used as a baseball bat after he outgrew it.
- His very first band played mariachi and polka music with an eclectic lineup including accordion, maracas, harmonica, and trumpet; he later quipped it would be 'hip' today.
- On his debut recording *Nasty!* (1968), he subbed in for George Benson at the last minute with no reputation as a young white guitarist.
- Berklee classmate Keith Jarrett left early for his pro career, while Abercrombie studied amid a small guitar program of wildly varying skill levels.
