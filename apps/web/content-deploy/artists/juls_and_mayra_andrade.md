## Biography
Mayra Andrade, born on February 13, 1985, in Havana, Cuba, to Cape Verdean parents, spent her early years in Cape Verde before her family moved frequently, including stints in Senegal, Angola, Germany, and eventually Paris, France, where she settled as a teenager. Exposed to diverse cultures from a young age, she began performing publicly around age 14-16 in Cape Verde and started voice lessons in Paris at 17. A pivotal moment came when she met composer Orlando Pantera, who significantly influenced her artistic development; at 16, she won the gold medal in the songwriting contest at the 2001 Jeux de la Francophonie in Canada, launching her career.[1][2][3][4]

Andrade's professional breakthrough arrived with her 2006 debut album *Navega*, which earned critical acclaim and the Preis der Deutschen Schallplattenkritik in 2007, followed by the BBC Radio 3 World Music Newcomer Award in 2008 for her style blending Cape Verdean genres like morna, funaná, batuque, and coladeira with jazz, afrobeats, and world music influences. Subsequent albums such as *Stória, stória...* (2009), *Studio 105* (2010), *Lovely Difficult* (2013), and *Manga* (2019) solidified her reputation, showcasing poetic lyrics, a vibrant voice, and collaborations with global artists. She received honors like Cape Verde's 1st Class Medal of the Order of the Volcano in 2010 and has performed across Portuguese-speaking regions, including Mindelo, Praia, and Lisbon, while basing herself in Paris and later Lisbon.[1][2][3][4]

Now a leading voice in Cape Verdean music, Andrade's nomadic upbringing informs her multicultural sound and advocacy work, including her role since 2015 as a UN 'Free & Equal' ambassador promoting human rights in Cape Verde. Her legacy endures as an inspiration for African artists, promoting Cape Verdean culture worldwide through innovative performances and recordings.[2][3]
