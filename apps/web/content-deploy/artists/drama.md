## Biography
DRAMA is an American indie soul duo from Chicago, consisting of producer Na'el Shehade and vocalist/songwriter Via Rosa (born Lluvia Rosa Vela). Their music blends R&B and dance with influences from pop, hip hop, jazz, bossa nova, and electronic genres, characterized by an independent approach to creation and release. Themes of love, loss, heartbreak, and self-love permeate their work.[1]

Via Rosa was born in Austin, Texas, and raised on an Indian reservation in northern California, touring with her parents' reggae band during her childhood. She developed an interest in poetry at charter school, which she later combined with self-produced beats in her late teens. After culinary school in Hollywood, she moved to Chicago in 2010 to care for her grandmother battling cancer, joining hip hop collective THEMPeople and releasing solo projects from 2010 to 2014. Na'el Shehade, born and raised in Chicago, began DJing in teenage years at clothing shops and record stores, immersed in the city's house and electronic scenes. He started producing music in high school, gaining licenses from Bravo and MTV, before studying arts management in business school and transitioning to collaborations as a producer.[1]

The duo released their debut album *Dance Without Me* on February 14, 2020, via Ghostly International, praised as a powerful exploration of heartbreak and the journey to self-love and acceptance. DRAMA continues to build their career independently, spanning diverse genres while maintaining a focus on emotional depth.[1]
