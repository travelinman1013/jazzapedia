## Biography
Vanessa da Mata was born in 1976 in Alto Garças, a small city of approximately 10,000 inhabitants in Mato Grosso, Brazil. Before pursuing music professionally, she worked as a basketball player and model. She grew up listening to venerated Brazilian artists like Antonio Carlos Jobim and developed a deep appreciation for Brazilian musical traditions. Prior to launching her solo career, da Mata composed for legendary Brazilian musicians including Caetano Veloso, Maria Bethânia, Milton Nascimento, and Chico César, establishing herself as a skilled songwriter within Brazil's music industry.

Da Mata's solo career has spanned over two decades, during which she became one of the most played artists in Brazil and won a Latin Grammy Award. Her musical style uniquely blends pop, reggae, and Brazilian music—particularly the modern popular Brazilian music (MPB) genre—creating a distinctive sound that resonated both domestically and internationally. Her breakthrough international success came in 2007 with the release of her third studio album, *Sim*, followed by the global hit "Boa Sorte/Good Luck," a duet with American musician Ben Harper that became an immediate success on YouTube. Several of her tracks, including *Ainda Bem*, *Vermelho*, and *Ai, Ai, Ai* (her first number-one hit in Brazil), achieved significant commercial and critical success.

Throughout her career, da Mata has released multiple studio albums and continues to tour internationally, bringing her passionate performances and sophisticated blend of Brazilian rhythms to audiences worldwide. Her artistry extends beyond music; she also authored a debut novel, *A Filha das Flores* (*Daughter of Flowers*), which was pitched at the Berlinale Film Festival in 2014, demonstrating her creative talents across multiple artistic mediums.
