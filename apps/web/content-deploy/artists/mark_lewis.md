## Biography
Mark Lewis is a Seattle-area native saxophonist and flutist with a four-decade career spanning multiple continents and jazz scenes. Born in Tacoma, Washington, Lewis demonstrated exceptional musical talent from middle school, forming his first band at age 14. He pursued formal training in composition, flute, electronic music, and piano at Western Washington University and the Cornish Institute of Allied Arts, while simultaneously leading several bands around the Seattle region. In Seattle, he studied under master musicians including drummer Otis "Candy" Finch, saxophonist Art Foxall, vocalist Bea Smith, and pianist Dee Daniels, who recognized his lyrical alto saxophone tone and accomplished flute playing.

In 1978, at age 20, Lewis made a pivotal decision to relocate to Europe, flying to Amsterdam with a one-way ticket, his alto saxophone, and $500. He established Rotterdam as his home base for the next 14 years, becoming a vital force on the international jazz scene as a player, label owner, and producer. During this period, he maintained three working Dutch groups: an organ trio with Carlo de Wijs, an experimental quartet with Willem Kühne, James Long, and Frans van Grinsven, and a world-jazz quintet featuring musicians from India, Holland, West Africa, and South America. He founded the Audio Daddio record label, which became an essential outlet for European and American jazz recordings, releasing work by artists including bassist Hein van de Geyn, drummer Philly Joe Jones, and tenor saxophonist Clifford Jordan.

Returning to North America, Lewis was discovered by musician and author Ted Gioia and auditioned for a record deal in the San Francisco area, ultimately playing for tenor saxophone legend Stan Getz, who praised his playing. His debut album "In The Spirit" reached the top 40 on jazz charts and sold over 900,000 copies. Lewis has been recognized with high rankings in the Jazz Station Awards, placing number two for alto saxophone and number three for flute for his 2017 album "The New York Session," which featured pianist George Cables, bassist Essiet Essiet, and drummer Victor Lewis.

## Fun Facts
- Lewis left Seattle in 1978 with only a one-way ticket to Amsterdam, an alto saxophone, and $500 in his pocket, with virtually no European contacts—a bold move encouraged by his mentor Candy Finch.
- Johnny Griffin, the legendary tenor saxophonist, gave Lewis his first gig in Europe, helping launch his international career.
- Lewis was so committed to performing and promoting his music that he would play anywhere, including Sweden in winter during the off-season when other musicians avoided touring, and he would bring stacks of records to sell at every venue.
- His debut album "In The Spirit" achieved remarkable commercial success for a jazz release, reaching the top 40 on jazz charts and selling over 900,000 copies.
