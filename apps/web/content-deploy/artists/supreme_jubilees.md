## Biography
The Supreme Jubilees were a California-based gospel-soul group formed in 1973 in Fresno, CA, consisting of brothers and cousins from two families: brothers Joe and Dave Kingsby along with Dave's son David Kingsby Jr., and keyboardist Leonard Sanders with his brothers Phillips (drummer), Tim (bassist), and Melvin (tenor). The Sanders family grew up singing together in the Witness of Jesus Christ church in Fresno, where their father Marion served as pastor, fostering their deep roots in gospel music. Guitarist Larry Price, unaffiliated with either family, completed the lineup.[1][2][3]

Known for their unique blend of funk gospel and classic soul—often described as music fit for 'God's disco'—the group released their only album, *It’ll All Be Over*, in 1980. Their sound featured high, angelic vocals over smooth grooves, combining spiritual themes of redemption and mortality with danceable rhythms. Following the album's release, they toured California alongside prominent gospel acts like the Gospel Keynotes, The Jackson Southernaires, and the Mighty Clouds of Joy, before embarking on a challenging tour to Texas.[1][2]

A planned follow-up album for 1981 never materialized, as the band members, facing hardships like cramped living conditions on the road, chose to prioritize their jobs, wives, and children over the uncertainties of touring life. The group disbanded shortly thereafter, though the friendships among members endured, leaving behind a small but influential legacy in R&B-gospel.[1][2][3]

## Fun Facts

- They endured extreme touring hardships in Texas, sometimes sleeping a dozen to a room, which ultimately contributed to their disbandment.
- A second album was planned for 1981 but never released due to members' reluctance to leave stable family lives for the road.
- The Sanders brothers honed their skills singing in their father's church, the Witness of Jesus Christ in Fresno, CA.
