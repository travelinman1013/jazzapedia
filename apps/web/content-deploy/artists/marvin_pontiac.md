## Biography
Marvin Pontiac is a fictional musical persona created by American musician, actor, and composer John Lurie, leader of the Lounge Lizards. The elaborate backstory portrays Pontiac as born in 1932 to a Malian father (originally surnamed Toure, changed to Pontiac upon moving to Detroit) and a Jewish mother from New Rochelle, New York. After his mother's institutionalization in 1936, he was raised in Bamako, Mali until age 15, where local music profoundly shaped him, before returning to the U.S. and pursuing an eclectic career blending blues, jazz, R&B, and storytelling in the 1950s and beyond, allegedly dying in 1977 after being hit by a bus in Detroit.[1][2][4][5][6]
