## Biography
Ignacio Cervantes Kawanag, born on July 31, 1847, in Havana, Cuba, was a child prodigy who began musical studies with his father, followed by training under pianist Juan Miguel Joval and composer Nicolás Ruiz Espadero. In 1859, he studied with visiting American composer Louis Moreau Gottschalk, who encouraged him to attend the Imperial Conservatoire de Paris from 1866 to 1870, where he trained under Charles-Valentin Alkan and Antoine François Marmontel, winning first prizes in piano (1866) and harmony (1868).[1][2][5] During his European stay, he performed with renowned artists like Christina Nilsson and Adelina Patti, earning praise from figures such as Gioacchino Rossini, Franz Liszt, and Charles Gounod.

Returning to Cuba in 1870, Cervantes became a prominent pianist, composer, conductor, and educator, though his career was interrupted by political activism. In 1875, he and violinist José White were expelled for fundraising concerts supporting Cuba's Ten Years' War independence efforts, leading to exile in the United States and Mexico until 1879; he faced further exile in 1895 during the Cuban War of Independence.[1][2] His compositional style fused Romanticism with Cuban nationalist elements, prominently featured in his 41 Danzas Cubanas for piano, alongside an opera (Maledetto, 1895), chamber works like Scherzo caprichoso (1885), zarzuelas, symphonic pieces, and vocal compositions. He conducted at Havana's Payret Theater and taught extensively, shaping Cuban music's creolization.[2][3]

Cervantes died in Havana on April 29, 1905, leaving a legacy as a pioneer of musical nationalism in the Americas, where his works embodied Cuba's cultural identity through innate idiosyncrasy rather than stylization, as noted by Alejo Carpentier. His Danzas Cubanas remain a cornerstone of Cuban piano literature, blending elegance, expressiveness, and vitality.[1][2]
