## Biography
Larry McCray, born April 5, 1960, in Magnolia, Arkansas—one of 10 children—grew up on a farm before his family relocated to Saginaw, Michigan, in 1972 seeking better economic opportunities in the automotive industry. Introduced to the guitar by his older sister Clara, who played blues in Arkansas, McCray was profoundly influenced by the 'Kings of the Blues'—Albert King, B.B. King, and Freddie King—as well as Albert Collins. After playing saxophone in school and graduating high school, he worked on the General Motors assembly line while forming the McCray Brothers with siblings Carl on bass and Steve on drums, performing locally in the early 1980s and blending traditional blues with rock elements.[2][3][4][5]

By the late 1980s, McCray's guitar prowess and vocals caught the ear of Virgin Records executive John Wooler, who signed him as the inaugural artist on his new Point Blank Records label. His debut album, *Ambition* (1990), recorded in a Detroit basement studio, fused blues, rock, and soul, earning critical acclaim and launching his career. Throughout the 1990s, he defined blues rock with albums like *Delta Hurricane* (1993, produced by Mike Vernon), *Meet Me at the Lake* (1996), and *Born to Play the Blues* (1998), while touring and collaborating with labelmate Albert Collins. In 2000, he founded Magnolia Records, releasing *Believe It* and later a live album, *Live on Interstate 75* (2006).[1][2][3][4][5]

McCray's career continued with performances alongside blues icons like B.B. King, Buddy Guy, Robert Cray, Keb' Mo', and Joe Bonamassa, as well as rock legends including the Allman Brothers and Dickie Betts. After a hiatus, he released *Blues Without You* in 2022 on Joe Bonamassa's Keeping the Blues Alive Records, produced by Bonamassa and Josh Smith, which topped *Blues Rock Review*'s 2022 albums and earned a Blues Music Award nomination. His style mixes raw Delta blues with amplified Chicago blues, and a new album is slated for 2025, affirming his enduring legacy in contemporary blues rock.[3][4][5]
