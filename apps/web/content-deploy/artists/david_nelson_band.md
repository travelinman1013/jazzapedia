## Biography
David Brian Nelson, born June 12, 1943, began his musical career in the early 1960s in the San Francisco Bay Area, playing folk and bluegrass with Jerry Garcia in bands like the Wildwood Boys, Hart Valley Drifters, and Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions, which included future Grateful Dead members. After stints with the New Delhi River Band and briefly Big Brother and the Holding Company, Nelson co-founded the New Riders of the Purple Sage (NRPS) in 1969 with Garcia and John 'Marmaduke' Dawson, pioneering psychedelic country rock and achieving success with Columbia Records through the early 1980s, including the hit 'Panama Red'.[2][1]

Nelson left NRPS in 1982 to pursue projects like the Jerry Garcia Acoustic Band on Broadway and touring with Al Rapone and the Zydeco Express. In 1994, he formed the David Nelson Band (DNB), drawing from former NRPS and Kingfish members, blending almost acoustic styles from his Garcia collaborations, roots rock, psychedelic country-rock, and Grateful Dead classics, with many songs co-written with lyricist Robert Hunter. The band has performed and recorded steadily, evolving lineups while maintaining a jam band, electroacoustic, and newgrass sound.[3][1][2]

DNB's legacy includes critical acclaim and Nelson's continued activity, reforming NRPS in 2005 with Buddy Cage and Michael Falzarano, co-founding bluegrass group The Papermill Creek Rounders with Lowell 'Banana' Levinger, and guest spots on Grateful Dead albums like Aoxomoxoa, Workingman's Dead, and American Beauty. In 2006, he performed 'Ripple' on the Grand Ole Opry, and in 2019 released a posthumous Hunter collaboration, cementing his influence in psychedelic country and jam scenes.[2][4]
