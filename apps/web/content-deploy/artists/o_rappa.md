## Biography
O Rappa, a Brazilian rock band formed in Rio de Janeiro in the early 1990s, originated as a reggae project organized by drummer Marcelo Yuka and producer Nelson Meirelles to support Papa Winnie's tour in Brazil. After the tour, Yuka placed an ad in O Globo newspaper to find a singer, ultimately selecting Marcelo Falcão from a pool of candidates, completing the lineup with bassist Lauro Farias, guitarist Xandão, and keyboardist Lobato. Their debut album struggled commercially, but their second release, Rappa Mundi, marked their breakthrough, blending reggae, rock, dub, and pop with incisive lyrics addressing urban violence, poverty, and social issues faced by city dwellers.[1][2]

The band's third album, Lado B Lado A, solidified their status as one of Brazil's top acts, featuring hits like 'Minha Alma (Me Deixa)' and 'O que Sobrou do Céu,' and is regarded among the best in Brazilian music history. Their sound evolved to incorporate samba, rap, MPB, hip-hop, and funk, creating a unique sonority that critiqued societal ills while maintaining broad appeal, selling over 3 million records and amassing 5 million Facebook followers. Tragedy struck in 2000 when Yuka was shot in the spine, becoming paraplegic due to his activism in favelas; he was fired in 2002 amid tensions.[1][3]

Post-Yuka, the remaining members—Falcão, Lauro, Xandão, and Lobato—continued, releasing albums like Marco Zero (Ao Vivo) in 2017 during their final tour, preserving their legacy as cultural icons influencing Brazilian reggae and social commentary. Their lyrics are studied in schools and universities, and they remain one of Brazil's most beloved bands for their live energy at venues like Circo Voador.[1][2][3]
