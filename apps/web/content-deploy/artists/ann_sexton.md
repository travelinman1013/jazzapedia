## Biography
Mary Ann Sexton, born on February 5, 1950, in Greenville, South Carolina, grew up in a family deeply influenced by gospel music and began singing in church as a child. She gained early local recognition through talent shows and joined the soul group Elijah & The Ebonies as their vocalist, recording the single 'I Confess' in 1967 or 1968 under the name Mary Sexton. While with the group, she met and married saxophonist Melvin Burton, and together they formed Ann Sexton and The Masters of Soul, releasing singles on Impel Records in Shelby, North Carolina.[1][2][3][4]

Spotted by songwriter David Lee in 1971, Sexton launched her solo career with the single 'You're Letting Me Down' / 'You've Been Gone Too Long' on Impel's Seventy-Seven label, produced by Nashville DJ John R. Richbourg. She recorded prolifically between 1971 and 1977, releasing around thirteen singles and two albums—'Loving You, Loving Me' (1973) and 'The Beginning' (1978)—featuring hits like 'You're Gonna Miss Me' (R&B #47 in 1973) and 'I'm His Wife.' Her style blended smooth southern soul ballads with funkier grooves, earning acclaim in northern soul circles, particularly for tracks like 'Colour My World Blue.'[1][2][3][4]

By 1977, Sexton left the music industry amid its stresses, moving to New York to teach special needs students for 20 years, retiring in 2010 without widely sharing her musical past. She made occasional comeback performances, including at the Baltic Soul Weekender in 2007 and 2008, cementing her legacy as a lesser-known but revered southern soul artist.[3][4]
