## Biography
Charlie Parker, known as 'Bird,' was born on August 29, 1920, in Kansas City, Kansas, to Charles Parker Sr. and Addie Boxley Parker. He began his musical journey on the baritone horn before switching to the alto saxophone at age 15, drawing early mentorship from Buster Smith and immersing himself in Kansas City's vibrant jazz scene. Parker's career accelerated in the late 1930s and early 1940s; he played with Jay McShann's band, which broke racial barriers by performing at the University of Missouri, and later joined Earl Hines's orchestra in New York in 1942, where he honed his revolutionary improvisational style amid personal struggles with drug addiction.[1][2][3]

In New York, Parker co-developed bebop—a fast-paced, harmonically complex jazz idiom—with Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonious Monk, Bud Powell, Kenny Clarke, and others, breaking from swing's predictability through chromatic harmonies, small note values, and impulsive rhythms. A stylistic breakthrough came during a 1939 jam session, and by 1945, he recorded classics like 'Billie's Bounce,' 'Now's the Time,' and 'Koko.' His 1946 Dial session, featuring 'Ornithology,' 'A Night in Tunisia,' 'Yardbird Suite,' and 'Moose the Mooche,' epitomized bebop's innovation. Parker formed quintets with Miles Davis and Max Roach, performed at Carnegie Hall, and inspired venues like Birdland, though heroin addiction led to his death on March 12, 1955, in New York City at age 34.[2][3]

Parker's legacy as one of jazz's three revolutionary geniuses—alongside Louis Armstrong and Ornette Coleman—endures through his technical mastery, emotional depth, and creativity, influencing hard bop and beyond. His work reshaped jazz, prioritizing virtuosic improvisation and laying groundwork for future genres, studied by musicians worldwide.[1][2][3]
