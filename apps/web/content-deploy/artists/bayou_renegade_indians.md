## Biography
June Victory, a legendary guitarist from New Orleans, formed the Bayou Renegades in the mid-1970s after gaining experience in the local music scene. Initially, he joined Willie Tee's New Orleans Project and provided backing for the pioneering Mardi Gras Indian group, the Wild Magnolias, which immersed him in the vibrant traditions of New Orleans Indian masking culture[1][2]. The Bayou Renegades emerged as one of the first bands to electrify Mardi Gras Indian music, blending traditional chanting and percussion with electric guitars, funk, and R&B arrangements, creating a distinctive 1970s sound influenced by Sly and the Family Stone and Funkadelic[3][5].

Victory's innovative approach with the Bayou Renegades brought the secretive, backstreet world of Mardi Gras Indians to wider audiences, including global listeners through performances and recordings. His scorching guitar work and local sets became legendary in New Orleans, captivating crowds at events like Jazz Fest and earning him recognition as a key figure in fusing Indian traditions with modern instrumentation[2][3]. The band's album on Monkey Hill Records further documented this groundbreaking style[6].

Victory's legacy endures as a culture bearer who helped popularize Mardi Gras Indian music beyond its acoustic roots, influencing the evolution of the genre at major festivals and through collaborations. A recent book, *The Return of Cabbage Alley: Stories of June Victory* by Thomas Brent Andrews, chronicles his extraordinary life and contributions based on extensive interviews[2].
