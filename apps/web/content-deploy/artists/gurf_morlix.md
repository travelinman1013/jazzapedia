## Biography
Gurf Morlix, born in 1951 in Buffalo, New York, discovered his passion for music at age 12 after watching The Beatles on The Ed Sullivan Show, prompting him to pick up the steel guitar and dream of blending rock and country. Raised outside Buffalo, he found limited opportunities locally and moved to Austin, Texas, in 1975, drawn by its burgeoning music scene, cheap rent, and gig opportunities. There, he immersed himself in the songwriting community alongside figures like Blaze Foley, Townes Van Zandt, and Guy Clark, initially working as a sideman while honing his skills. In 1981, he relocated to Los Angeles, where he spent over a decade as Lucinda Williams' guitarist, bandleader, backing vocalist, and producer for her acclaimed self-titled 1988 album and Sweet Old World (1992), helping define the emerging Americana genre.[1][2][3][4]

Returning to Austin in the early 1990s, Morlix established himself as a premier producer for Americana icons including Ray Wylie Hubbard, Mary Gauthier, Slaid Cleaves, Robert Earl Keen, and others, earning induction into the Austin Music Hall of Fame, Buffalo Music Hall of Fame, and the Americana Music Association's Instrumentalist of the Year award in 2009. His production style emphasized authenticity, capturing artists' raw 'growl' and grooves. Transitioning to songwriting later, he released his debut solo album Toad of Titicaca in 2000, followed by over 15 critically acclaimed records like Diamonds to Dust (2013), The Soul & the Heal (2017), and Impossible Blue (2019), blending harrowing introspection with heartening resolve, often exploring mortality—especially after a 2016 heart attack and the 2014 death of collaborator Ian McLagan.[1][3][4]

Now in his 70s and based in Austin, Morlix has stepped back from touring but remains prolific, crafting songs in 10-year career cycles as sideman, producer, and solo artist. His musical style—rooted in Americana and alt-country—features unflinching lyrics, masterful guitar work, and a commitment to 'legendary integrity,' influencing generations while continuing to produce and record selectively.[1][2][3]

## Fun Facts
- When asked for his biography by a promoter, Morlix replied with just two words: 'legendary integrity,' later admitting it was 'half true' but reflective of his direct, no-nonsense approach.[1]
- He suffered a serious heart attack in February 2016 while stuck in traffic en route to a gig but quickly recovered, recording two of his strongest albums shortly after.[1]
- Morlix moved to Austin in 1975 where rent was $53/month and gigs paid $50, allowing him to play 15 nights a month in what he called 'heaven.'[3]
- Decided to become a musician exactly one day after watching The Beatles on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1964.[4]
