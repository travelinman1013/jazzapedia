## Biography
The Commodores, an American funk and soul group, formed in 1968 at Tuskegee Institute (now Tuskegee University) in Tuskegee, Alabama, when members from former campus bands The Mystics and The Jays merged. The original lineup included Lionel Richie (vocals, keyboards, saxophone), Thomas McClary (guitar, vocals), William King (trumpet), Ronald LaPread (bass, trumpet), Walter 'Clyde' Orange (drums, vocals), and Milan Williams (keyboards, guitar, drums), with early members Andre Callahan and Michael Gilbert soon replaced. After winning the college's freshman talent contest, they gigged locally at fraternity parties and the Black Forest Inn, performing covers and originals with initial singer James Ingram (not the famous solo artist). Manager Benjamin 'Benny' Ashburn secured gigs, including a brief Atlantic Records stint, before their breakthrough in 1970 opening for the Jackson 5, leading to a Motown signing in 1972.[1][2][3][4][5]

## Fun Facts

- Their first Motown hit 'Machine Gun' was an up-tempo instrumental recorded in Muscle Shoals, Alabama.[4]
- Keyboardist Milan Williams left in 1989 after refusing to tour South Africa.[2][3]
