## Biography
Clarence 'Gatemouth' Brown (April 18, 1924 — September 10, 2005) was born in Vinton, Louisiana, and raised in Orange, Texas. His father, a railroad engineer and weekend musician, taught him fiddle, while his brothers instructed him in guitar and drums. Brown's professional music career began in 1945 playing drums in San Antonio, Texas with local bands including The Gay Swingsters. The pivotal moment came in 1947 when he attended a T-Bone Walker concert at Don Robey's Bronze Peacock Club in Houston. When Walker became ill, Brown took up guitar and performed 'Gatemouth Boogie' to enthusiastic acclaim, earning the nickname 'Gatemouth' from a high school teacher who said he had 'a voice like a gate.' This performance led Robey to become his manager and launch his recording career.

Brown's early success came through Peacock Records, the first successful post-war black-owned record label founded by Robey. His 1949 single 'Mary Is Fine' reached Number 8 on the R&B charts, followed by numerous hits including 'Okie Dokie Stomp,' 'Boogie Rambler,' and 'Dirty Work at the Crossroads.' However, by the late 1950s, Brown grew frustrated with the limitations of being confined to blues and R&B, leading him to part ways with Peacock Records by 1961. The 1960s proved challenging as he struggled to find consistent work, partly due to strained relations with the influential Robey. During this period, he worked as bandleader on the Dallas syndicated R&B television show The !!!! Beat in 1966 and moved to Nashville, where he began incorporating country music into his repertoire, recording with Roy Clark and appearing on Hee Haw.

Brown's career renaissance came in the 1970s when he began performing the eclectic range of styles—country, jazz, Cajun, blues, and R&B—for which he would become renowned. He toured extensively throughout the United States, Europe, East Africa, and the Soviet Union, serving as a musical ambassador for the U.S. State Department. In 1979, he undertook a historic 6-week, 44-concert tour of the Soviet Union, marking the first time the USSR contracted directly with a U.S. private citizen for a musical tour. The 1980s brought renewed recognition through releases on Rounder Records and Alligator Records, with his 1982 album 'Alright Again!' winning a Grammy and revitalizing his U.S. career. Brown became known for 'fighting purism by synthesizing old blues, country, jazz, Cajun music and rhythm & blues styles,' ultimately broadening the parameters of blues music and redefining the entire blues repertoire. He received the Rhythm and Blues Foundation's Pioneer Award in 1997 and was inducted into the Blues Foundation Hall of Fame in 1999, winning eight W.C. Handy Awards and six Grammy nominations throughout his career.

## Fun Facts
- Brown earned his famous 'Gatemouth' nickname from a high school teacher who said he had 'a voice like a gate,' a comment that stuck with him throughout his career.
- During a brief hiatus from music in the late 1960s, Brown moved to New Mexico and became a deputy sheriff before being drawn back to music by the developing blues audience in Europe.
- In 1979, Brown's Soviet Union tour was historic as the first time the USSR contracted directly with a U.S. private citizen (manager Jim Halsey) for a musical tour, rather than going through the U.S. State Department as all previous tours had.
- Brown was a true multi-instrumentalist who mastered guitar, fiddle, drums, viola, harmonica, piano, mandolin, and bass—an exceptionally rare combination of skills in blues music.
