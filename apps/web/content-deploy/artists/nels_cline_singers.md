## Biography
The Nels Cline Singers is an avant-garde jazz ensemble led by American guitarist and composer Nels Cline, founded in 2001 as a singerless trio blending free jazz, experimental jazz, and indie influences. Cline, born January 4, 1956, in Los Angeles, began playing guitar at age 12 alongside his twin brother Alex Cline on drums, forming the teenage rock band Homogenized Goo inspired by Jimi Hendrix, Jeff Beck, and The Beatles. Their early development drew from electric Miles Davis albums like Bitches Brew and free jazz pioneers, leading to tutelage under Vinny Golia and Eric Von Essen, with Cline's debut recording Elegies in 1980.[1][2]

The Singers debuted with the 2002 album Instrumentals on Cryptogramophone, followed by The Giant Pin in 2004, establishing Cline's avant-garde presence through dynamic, nondoctrinaire compositions echoing 1970s fusion like Miles Davis and Tony Williams Lifetime. The group expanded over time, releasing Share the Wealth in 2020 on Blue Note with members Skerik, Brian Marsella, Trevor Dunn, Scott Amendola, and Cyro Baptista, and later grew to a sextet for Macroscope on Mack Avenue. Cline's parallel career with Wilco since 2004 and over 200 recordings across genres underscores the Singers' role in his experimental legacy.[2][3][4]

Known for free improvisation and genre-blurring energy, the Nels Cline Singers gained acclaim in free-jazz and indie-rock circles, with expansions driven by commissions like the Festival International de Musique Actuelle de Victoriaville. Their evolving lineup and releases, including recent projects, highlight Cline's enduring innovation in pushing jazz boundaries while maintaining a core space between fusion and avant-garde.[3]
