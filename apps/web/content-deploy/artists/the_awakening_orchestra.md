## Biography
The Awakening Orchestra is a large jazz ensemble of approximately 20-24 players, founded and led by composer Kyle Saulnier, a Connecticut native who studied composition at Berklee College of Music and Manhattan School of Music before settling in the Bronx, New York. Saulnier developed the orchestra over nearly seven years of writing and rehearsing partitures, culminating in its debut album *This Is Not the Answer* (Innova Recordings, 2014), a double album subtitled 'Of Conflict & Love' that blends jazz, free improvisation, rock, and orchestral elements in ambitious, multi-movement works comparable to Carla Bley's *Escalator Over the Hill*. The ensemble's music is described as a 'post-modern third stream' approach, working on a broad canvas with epic, sweeping sounds aimed at higher artistic realms, incorporating influences from progressive big band traditions.[1][3][6]

Subsequent releases include *Interlude: Atticus Live! - The Music of Jesse Lewis* (Biophilia Records, 2016), featuring arrangements of guitarist Jesse Lewis's compositions; *Atticus Live!* (2016); and *Volume II: To Call Her to a Higher Plain* (Biophilia Records, 2020), a nearly two-hour digital album with two full symphonies, interpretations of works by Bill Frisell, Molly Drake, Nine Inch Nails, and a brass chorale arrangement of Eric Whitacre's choral piece. The title track, a 34-minute three-movement symphony, draws inspiration from George McGovern's words on patriotism. The orchestra emphasizes mentorship, rhythmic innovation, and blending diverse sounds, with Saulnier as a lifelong student and teacher of jazz.[3][4][9]

The Awakening Orchestra's legacy lies in its monumental achievements in contemporary large-ensemble jazz, pushing boundaries with complex, politically and emotionally charged compositions performed by committed musicians who deeply understand Saulnier's vision. Through Biophilia Records, the group continues to release music that challenges mainstream jazz, fostering a community rooted in artistic integrity over commercial concerns.[1][3][8]

## Fun Facts

- Trombonist Sam Burtis mixed and mastered many influential large-ensemble records that shaped Kyle Saulnier's sound, yet remained committed solely to artistic decisions over money or prestige.[1]
- Guitarist Michael MacAllister pioneered remote collaboration with Saulnier before it became mainstream, editing multiple albums including Volumes I and II.[4]
- The orchestra's *Volume II* includes a brass chorale rearrangement of Eric Whitacre's choral piece and tunes by Nine Inch Nails, showcasing its eclectic 'post-modern third stream' style.[3][6]
