## Biography
Caddywhompus is a noise rock and math rock duo formed in 2008 by lifelong friends Chris Rehm (vocals and guitar) and Sean Hart (drums), who grew up together in Houston, Texas, before relocating to New Orleans, Louisiana. The band has been playing music together since middle school, evolving from abstract pop-tunes into a dynamic sound blending experimental noise rock, math rock, psych, post-punk, and indie jazz elements. Their music features bright, knotty guitar-and-drums arrangements that build tension through dissonant, scattershot riffs before resolving into clean, melodic payoffs, as heard in tracks like “Feathering a Nest” and “Appetite.”[1][2][3][8]

Since their inception, Caddywhompus has released multiple albums, including their fourth full-length *Odd Hours* in 2017 via Inflated Records, which showcased refined production thanks to collaborator Ross Farbe's Steve Albini-inspired approach of minimal mic placement and live tracking for a bigger, dimensional sound. Earlier works like *The Great Nothing* LP highlighted their explosive spontaneity without meandering, drawing comparisons to duos like The White Stripes for their punchy output. Based in New Orleans, they contribute to the local indie scene with a style that defies simple categorization, often described as noise pop or avant pop.[1][3]

While not mainstream, Caddywhompus maintains a cult following in underground circuits, with low Spotify popularity (3) reflecting their niche appeal in math rock and noise genres. Their legacy lies in capturing the raw energy of experimental rock, influencing perceptions of two-piece bands capable of complex, genre-zigzagging compositions rooted in Southern U.S. indie scenes.[3][Spotify context]

## Fun Facts
- The band's name derives from a colloquialism meaning 'crooked' or 'uneven,' which ironically contrasts their tightly crafted yet spontaneous sound.[1]
- They've experimented with self-descriptions like 'noise pop,' 'avant pop,' experimental noise rock, math rock, psych, post-rock, and post-punk, but avoid strict labels.[3]
- For *Odd Hours*, they adopted a stripped-down recording method with one guitar amp and one drum set live in the room, crediting it for a bigger sound than their previous wall-of-noise style.[3]
- The *Odd Hours* cover art by Max Seckel depicts Louisiana swamp flotsam like cinderblocks and Spanish moss against an alligator warning sign, symbolizing beauty and decay.[3]
