## Biography
OKAN is a Canadian Afro-Cuban jazz ensemble led by Cuban-born violinist and vocalist Elizabeth Rodriguez and percussionist and vocalist Magdelys Savigne. Both women were trained in Havana, with Rodriguez beginning classical violin studies at an early age and becoming concertmaster of the Havana Youth Orchestra, while Savigne, from Santiago de Cuba, faced significant cultural barriers as a female percussionist in Cuba, likening her pursuit to 'coming out' to her family[1][3][8]. They met in 2016 in Canada while performing with Jane Bunnett's Maqueque, an Afro-Cuban jazz project mentoring female Cuban musicians, which earned a Grammy nomination for its 2016 album Oddara[2][8][9].

Relocating to Toronto, the multicultural environment enriched their sound with influences from Brazil, Spain, New Orleans, Africa, Turkey, and classic Cuban styles like changú, timba, pilón, and Santería chants[4][7][8]. OKAN fuses these Afro-Cuban roots with jazz, folk, classical, and indie-pop elements, singing in Spanish, Yoruba, and Spanglish about immigration, resistance, love, justice, and bravery. Their name derives from the Santería word for 'heart,' reflecting their deep ties to Afro-Cuban spirituality and ancestry[1][2][5][9]. Debuting with Laberinto in 2018 and Sombras in 2019, they gained Juno Award nominations, winning for Espiral (2020, World Music Album of the Year in 2021) and Okantomi (2023, same category in 2024)[5][9]. Both leaders are Grammy and Latin Grammy nominees, and former Juno nominees with Battle of Santiago[9].

As pioneers, Rodriguez and Savigne challenge male-dominated genres by embracing roles as composers, multi-instrumentalists, and leaders, bringing powerful harmonies, virtuosic performances, and provocative lyrics to Latin and world jazz fusion[1][3][6]. Their romantic and musical partnership has propelled OKAN's rise, including NPR Tiny Desk debuts and tours with Rodrigo y Gabriela[6].
