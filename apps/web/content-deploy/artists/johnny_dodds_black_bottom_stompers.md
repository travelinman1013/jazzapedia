## Biography
Johnny Dodds, born on April 12, 1892, in Waveland, Mississippi, grew up in a musical family where his father and uncle played violin, his sister played melodeon, and he sang high tenor in the family quartet during adolescence. His instrumental career began around age 17 with a toy flute intended for his younger brother Warren 'Baby' Dodds, transitioning to clarinet as a self-taught player, developing a distinctive piercing tone with strong vibrato that cut through ensembles. By 1912, he joined Kid Ory’s top jazz band in New Orleans, freelancing for five years and building his reputation in the city's jazz scene.[1][2][4]

In 1921, Dodds and his brother Baby joined Joe 'King' Oliver's Creole Jazz Band in San Francisco, moving to Chicago in 1922 at Lincoln Gardens, where Louis Armstrong later joined. After leaving Oliver in 1924 due to travel reluctance and musical differences, Dodds became house clarinetist and bandleader at Kelly's Stables until 1930, recording extensively with Louis Armstrong's Hot Five and Hot Seven, Jelly Roll Morton's Red Hot Peppers, Lovie Austin, and his own Johnny Dodds' Black Bottom Stompers (1927-1929) for labels like Paramount, Brunswick/Vocalion, and Victor. Known for his 'funky blues playing' earning the nickname 'Toilet,' he became a Chicago jazz star in the 1920s with a serious, reserved style blending ragtime and New Orleans jazz.[1][2][3][4][5]

The Great Depression caused his career to decline sharply, with limited recordings in the 1930s due to ill health—only two Decca sessions in 1938 and 1940. Dodds died of a stroke on August 8, 1940, in Chicago, buried at Lincoln Cemetery in Blue Island, Illinois. His legacy endures through pioneering recordings that shifted jazz toward soloist prominence, influencing the transition from ensemble to individualistic expression.[1][2][3]
