## Biography
Celeste Epiphany Waite, known professionally as Celeste, was born on May 5, 1994, in Los Angeles, California, and raised in Saltdean near Brighton, UK, after moving there as a child. From a young age, she showed a passion for music, influenced by family exposure to Aretha Franklin and self-discovered artists like Thelonious Monk via YouTube, while singing hymns at her church in Brighton. At 16, the death of her father from lung cancer inspired her first song, 'Sirens,' which she uploaded to YouTube and caught the attention of a manager. After graduating from Varndean College with studies in Music Technology, she gigged locally, worked at a pub, and began uploading tracks to SoundCloud in 2014, providing vocals for electronic producers like Avicii on 'Touch Me' and Tieks on 'Sing That Song.'[1][2][5]
