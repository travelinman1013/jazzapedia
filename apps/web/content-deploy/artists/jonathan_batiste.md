## Biography
Jonathan Michael Batiste, born on November 11, 1986, in Metairie, Louisiana, grew up immersed in New Orleans' vibrant music scene as part of a musical family dynasty. He began playing drums at age eight with the Batiste Brothers Band alongside his father and relatives, later switching to piano at his mother's suggestion around age 11 or 12, taking classical lessons from teacher Shirley Herstein for seven years while transcribing video game music to hone his skills. After graduating from St. Augustine High School and the New Orleans Center for Creative Arts (NOCCA) in 2004, Batiste attended The Juilliard School, earning a Bachelor of Music in jazz studies in 2008 and a Master of Music in 2011. His debut album, the instrumental *Times in New Orleans* featuring local talents like Jason Marsalis and Donald Harrison Jr., was released at age 17 in 2004.[1][2][3]

Batiste's career gained momentum in New York, where he formed the band Stay Human in 2005 with Juilliard peers bassist Phil Kuehn, drummer Joe Saylor, saxophonist Eddie Barbash, and tuba player Ibanda Ruhumbika, releasing the busker-style EP *My N.Y.* in 2011 and *Social Music* in 2013. He served as bandleader and musical director for *The Late Show with Stephen Colbert* from 2015 to 2022, blending New Orleans jazz, funk, and R&B in nightly performances that emphasized human connection. His 2021 album *We Are* earned critical acclaim, leading to a record 11 Grammy nominations and five wins, including Album of the Year in 2022; he also secured an Academy Award, Golden Globe, BAFTA, and Sports Emmy.[1][2][4]

Batiste's genre-defying style fuses his New Orleans roots with jazz innovation, classical training, and modern influences, extending to compositions like the symphony featured in the 2024 Netflix documentary *American Symphony*, which chronicles his Carnegie Hall ambitions amid his wife Suleika Jaouad's cancer treatment. A Juilliard board member since 2022 and inaugural Arnhold Creative Associate in 2018, his legacy includes advancing music education and uplifting performances worldwide.[1][2][4][5]
