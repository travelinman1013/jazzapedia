## Biography
The Deslondes are an Americana band formed in the Holy Cross neighborhood of New Orleans' Lower Ninth Ward, taking their name from Deslonde Street where key members Sam Doores and Dan Cutler lived. The group originated from earlier projects: Sam Doores met Cameron Snyder in college, inspired by Woody Guthrie's *Bound for Glory*, leading them to form The Broken Wing Routine and later connect with Riley Downing at the Woody Guthrie Folk Festival in Okemah, Oklahoma. Doores and Cutler played in The Tumbleweeds and supported Hurray for the Riff Raff, while Snyder and John James Tourville toured with The Longtime Goners; the band coalesced in 2013 when The Tumbleweeds rebranded to The Deslondes due to name conflicts.[1][2][4][7]

Their self-titled debut album released in 2015 on New West Records blended folk, rock 'n' roll, bluegrass, R&B, roots music, blues, gospel, country, and zydeco, earning critical acclaim with singles like 'Fought The Blues And Won' premiered by NPR and 'The Real Deal' featured by Rolling Stone. Over four albums, including *Roll It Out* (recent), they maintained a democratic songwriting and vocal approach among members Dan Cutler (vocals/stand-up bass), Sam Doores (vocals/guitar), Riley Downing (vocals/guitar), Howe Pearson (vocals/percussion, replacing Cameron Snyder post-2022), and John James Tourville (fiddle/pedal steel, electric guitar).[1][3][4]

The band's style reflects New Orleans' diverse sounds—Fats Domino, Allen Toussaint, George Jones, rural blues, rockabilly—fostered in a 'neighborhood hang' ethos at Doores' home, evolving through 15+ years of touring, lineup changes, and communal events like the All-Star Covered Dish Country Jamboree. Their legacy endures as a tight-knit group capturing rootsy, danceable energy amid personal growth and shared history.[3][4][6]
