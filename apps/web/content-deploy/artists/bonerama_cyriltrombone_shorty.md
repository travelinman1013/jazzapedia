## Biography
Trombone Shorty, born Troy Andrews on January 2, 1986, is an American musician from New Orleans, Louisiana, who emerged as a prodigious talent at an exceptionally young age. At four years old, he received a trombone from his brother James and made his first public appearance at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, where Bo Diddley invited him on stage. By age six, Andrews was leading his own brass band, and he participated in brass band parades throughout his childhood. He attended the New Orleans Center for Creative Arts (NOCCA) alongside Jon Batiste and graduated from Warren Easton High School in 2004, having been mentored since youth by Cyril Neville, whom he considers "a second father."

Trombone Shorty's career trajectory accelerated dramatically in his teenage years and beyond. In 2006, he began working with producer Bob Ezrin and U2 at Abbey Road Studios, which led to performances with U2 and Green Day at the Louisiana Superdome reopening. He signed to Blue Note Records in February 2017, releasing his debut for the label, *Parking Lot Symphony*, on April 28, 2017. Since 2010, he has released five chart-topping studio albums, with his most recent being *Lifted* (2022), recorded at his own Buckjump Studio with producer Chris Seefried. His music fuses rock, pop, jazz, funk, and hip hop into a distinctive sound that reflects New Orleans' rich musical heritage.

Beyond his recording and touring success, Trombone Shorty has become a cultural ambassador and educator. He has performed at major festivals including Coachella, Bonnaroo, Lollapalooza, and Newport Jazz, and has taken over the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival's final set—a position previously held by artists like Neil Young and the Black Keys. He founded the Trombone Shorty Foundation to support youth music education and has organized annual cultural exchange trips to Cuba featuring workshops and concerts. His influence extends to children's literature, having received the prestigious Caldecott Honor for his first children's book, and he was honored with his own Sesame Street Muppet character.
