## Biography
Jim Snidero, born James J. Snidero on May 29, 1958, in Redwood City, California, to Italian-American parents, grew up in Camp Springs, Maryland, near Washington, D.C. From a young age, he was immersed in music through family and school programs, quickly developing talent on the alto saxophone. As a teenager, he studied with esteemed saxophonists including Phil Woods, Jim Murphy, Ron Diehl, Tim Eyerman, and later David Liebman. He attended the University of North Texas, performing with the renowned One O'Clock Lab Band in 1980-1981, honing his skills in a premier jazz program.[1][2][3][4]

Moving to New York City in 1981 at age 23, Snidero rapidly established himself, first joining Brother Jack McDuff's band and recording albums like *Having a Good Time* (1982) and *Lift Every Voice and Sing* (1983). His sideman career flourished with ensembles such as Toshiko Akiyoshi Jazz Orchestra (1983), Frank Wess Sextet (1985), Mingus Big Band (1996-2000), Eddie Palmieri's band (from 1994), and Frank Sinatra's band (1991-1995, including *Duets II*). As a leader, he debuted with *On Time* (1984), followed by acclaimed releases like *Mixed Bag* (1987), *Blue Afternoon* (1989)—named among the 1001 best jazz albums—and *Strings* (2003), showcasing his compositional range from post-bop to string arrangements. His style blends hard bop influences with virtuoso improvisation, rich tone, and stylistic diversity across over 25 leader albums on labels like Criss Cross, Milestone, and Savant.[1][2][3][4][9]

A Grammy winner and DownBeat Critics' Poll recipient, Snidero has shaped jazz education as the best-selling author of the *Jazz Conception* series (1996 onward), *The Essence of the Blues* (2018), and *The Essence of Bebop* (2020). Faculty at The New School, with visiting roles at Indiana and Princeton Universities, his legacy endures through innovative recordings like *Live at the Deer Head* (2021, 5-star DownBeat review) and over 16 million streams, affirming his status as a master alto saxophonist, composer, arranger, and educator.[1][2][4][6]
