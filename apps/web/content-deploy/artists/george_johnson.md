# George Johnson

## Biography
George Washington Johnson (1846–1914) was an American singer and one of the first recording stars of the phonograph era, widely regarded as the first African American recording star in commercial music history.[4][1][3] Born into slavery in Virginia, likely in either Fluvanna County or near Wheatland in Loudoun County, he was probably freed in 1853 and grew up near Wheatland as the companion and servant of a white farmer’s son, where he developed his musical ability and even learned to read and write despite such education being illegal for Black children in pre–Civil War Virginia.[4][1] After emancipation he eventually moved north, settling in New York City by the 1870s, where he worked as a street performer in Manhattan, especially around ferry terminals on the Hudson River, entertaining crowds with his powerful voice, comic patter, whistling, and infectious laughter.[4][1][3]

Between January and May 1890, Johnson was recruited by phonograph distributors Charles Marshall of the New York Phonograph Company and Victor Emerson of the New Jersey Phonograph Company, who heard him performing and hired him to make records for their coin‑operated phonograph machines.[4][3] In 1891 he began recording for the North American Phonograph Company, including sessions at Thomas Edison’s laboratory in West Orange, New Jersey.[4] His novelty pieces “The Whistling Coon” and “The Laughing Song” became some of the best‑selling recordings of the 1890s; because cylinder duplication technology was still primitive, Johnson had to perform the same few titles literally tens of thousands of times, with contemporary catalogues and later research estimating that he personally recorded between 25,000 and 50,000 copies of his songs.[1][3] These recordings, steeped in the racist “coon song” tradition of the era, made him a star of early vaudeville and a mainstay of the fledgling record industry, even as they reflected and reinforced the racial caricatures of the Jim Crow period.[2][3] In 1894 he began recording regularly with popular vaudeville artist Len Spencer, a collaboration and friendship that continued into Johnson’s later years; he went on to record for Berliner Gramophone, Edison, Columbia, Victor, the Chicago Talking Machine Company, Bettini, and numerous other cylinder and disc companies through about 1909–1910.[4]

By the early 20th century, improvements in recording technology and the emergence of new stars led to a decline in Johnson’s popularity, and mass‑production processes meant his labor‑intensive method of re‑recording each cylinder was no longer necessary.[1][4] Around this time he found work as a doorman in Len Spencer’s office building and later moved back to Harlem, living modestly and largely forgotten by the general public despite the trail he had blazed for Black recording artists.[1][2] Johnson died of pneumonia in 1914 in New York at about 67 years of age and was buried in an unmarked grave in Maple Grove Cemetery in Kew Gardens, Queens.[1][4] In retrospect, historians and music scholars recognize him as a pioneering figure whose commercial success demonstrated the viability of Black performers in the recording industry and whose work marks the starting point of African American participation in commercially recorded music, even as the content of his most famous songs underscores the complex, often painful racial dynamics of American popular entertainment at the end of the 19th century.[3][1][4]

## Fun Facts
- Because cylinder records in the 1890s could not be mass‑duplicated efficiently, Johnson reportedly had to perform his hit songs thousands of times for recording horns, with contemporary and later estimates suggesting he recorded his two main titles between 38,000 and 50,000 times to meet demand.[1][3]
- Some of Johnson’s recording sessions took place at Thomas Edison’s own laboratory in West Orange, New Jersey, placing him at the technological forefront of the new phonograph industry as one of its earliest and most heavily recorded vocalists.[4]
- Despite being born into slavery and living through the violent Jim Crow era, Johnson became one of the biggest sellers in the young American record industry, yet he died in relative obscurity and was buried in an unmarked grave in Maple Grove Cemetery in Queens, New York.[1][3]
- Johnson’s best‑known pieces, including “The Whistling Coon” and “The Laughing Song,” belong to the racially stereotyped “coon song” genre, making his legacy a complex mix of groundbreaking Black representation in recorded music and participation in material that reflected the entrenched racism of his time.[2][3]

## Musical Connections

### Mentors/Influences
- [[unnamed_white_farmers_family_near_wheatland_virginia|Unnamed white farmer’s family near Wheatland, Virginia]] - Johnson was raised as the companion and servant of a white farmer’s son, within whose household he developed his musical ability and learned to read and write in his youth. (Early informal singing, whistling, and performance skills developed in the household rather than on specific commercial recordings.) [Childhood and adolescence before the American Civil War (1850s–early 1860s).]

### Key Collaborators
- [[len_spencer|Len Spencer]] - Popular vaudeville performer and recording artist who recorded numerous duet and ensemble pieces with Johnson and later employed him as a doorman when Johnson’s recording career waned. (Multiple vaudeville‑style comic and musical recordings for labels including North American Phonograph Company, Berliner Gramophone, and others, beginning with joint sessions in the mid‑1890s.) [From 1894 recording sessions through Johnson’s later years up to his death in 1914.[4][1][2]]
- [[charles_marshall_new_york_phonograph_company_and_victor_emerson_new_jersey_phonograph_company|Charles Marshall (New York Phonograph Company) and Victor Emerson (New Jersey Phonograph Company)]] - Regional phonograph company representatives who scouted Johnson as a street performer and hired him as a recording artist for their coin‑operated phonograph machines, effectively launching his professional recording career. (Early cylinder recordings of “The Whistling Coon” and “The Laughing Song” and other pieces produced for New York and New Jersey Phonograph Company catalogues.) [Initial recording recruitment and sessions between January and May 1890 and subsequent work in the early 1890s.[4][3]]
- [[thomas_a._edisons_laboratory_engineers_and_north_american_phonograph_company_staff|Thomas A. Edison’s laboratory engineers and North American Phonograph Company staff]] - Technical and production collaborators who supervised Johnson’s recording sessions, including at Edison’s West Orange, New Jersey laboratory, for commercial release on early phonograph cylinders. (1891 cylinder sessions for North American Phonograph Company, featuring “The Whistling Coon,” “The Laughing Song,” and other titles recorded in Edison’s facilities.) [Early commercial recording period beginning in 1891.[4]]

### Artists Influenced
- [[later_african_american_recording_artists_in_the_early_20th_century_collective|Later African American recording artists in the early 20th century (collective)]] - Johnson’s commercial success as an early phonograph star demonstrated that records by a Black performer could sell in large numbers, helping open the door for subsequent African American singers and musicians in the recording industry. (His hit recordings “The Whistling Coon” and “The Laughing Song,” which established a commercial precedent for Black‑made records in the 1890s and 1900s.) [From the 1890s forward, influencing artists active in the 1900s–1920s and beyond.[3][4][1]]
- [[john_wilfahrt_as_whoopee_adaptation_of_the_laughing_song|John Wilfahrt (as “Whoopee” adaptation of “The Laughing Song”)]] - Wilfahrt later re‑released Johnson’s “The Laughing Song” under the title “Whoopee,” illustrating how Johnson’s work entered the broader American popular repertoire and influenced later performers and arrangers. (Adaptation and re‑release of “The Laughing Song” retitled “Whoopee.”) [Early to mid‑20th century, following Johnson’s original 1890s recordings.[3]]
