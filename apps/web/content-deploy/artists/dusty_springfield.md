## Biography
Dusty Springfield, born Mary Bernadette O'Brien in London, England in 1939 to Irish immigrant parents, became one of the most iconic female vocalists of the 1960s.[8] She began her musical career in the late 1950s, singing in local folk clubs with her brother Tom before joining The Lana Sisters in 1958.[2] In 1960, she left to form The Springfields, a folk-pop trio with her brother and Reshad Feild (later replaced by Mike Hurst), which achieved moderate success before disbanding in late 1963.[2]

Springfield's solo career launched in January 1964 with "I Only Want to Be with You," a UK No. 4 hit that established her as a major force in British pop.[1][2] Throughout the 1960s, she charted six transatlantic Top 40 hits, including "Stay Awhile" (1964), "All I See Is You" (1966), "I'll Try Anything" (1967), and her signature songs "You Don't Have to Say You Love Me" (1966), which topped the UK charts and reached No. 4 in the US, and "Son of a Preacher Man" (1969).[1][2][4] Her musical style blended pop sensibilities with soul and rhythm-and-blues influences, particularly after she began studying American soul artists like Aretha Franklin and Mavis Staples.[4] In 1968, she signed with Atlantic Records and recorded the critically acclaimed album *Dusty in Memphis* with legendary producer Jerry Wexler, marking the commercial and artistic pinnacle of her career.[4][6]

Springfield's career declined significantly in the 1970s and early 1980s due to poor management and personal struggles with drugs and alcohol, with no charting singles between 1971 and 1986.[1][2] Her career was revitalized in 1987 through a collaboration with British synthpop duo the Pet Shop Boys on "What Have I Done to Deserve This?," which reached No. 2 on both the UK Singles Chart and Billboard Hot 100, followed by two additional UK Top 20 hits in 1989.[1][3] She was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the National Rhythm & Blues Hall of Fame, and the UK Music Hall of Fame, and is widely regarded as one of the greatest female singers in popular music history.[3] Springfield passed away on March 2, 1999, at age 59 in Henley-on-Thames, England.[2]

## Fun Facts
- In November 1968, during Memphis recording sessions, Dusty Springfield suggested that Atlantic Records executive Jerry Wexler sign the newly formed British band Led Zeppelin. She knew their bassist John Paul Jones from his session work on her earlier albums. Without ever having seen them perform, Wexler signed Led Zeppelin to a $200,000 deal—the largest contract for a new band at that time.[2]
- In the late 1960s, Springfield hosted her own television series on the BBC and ITV and guest-presented the popular show Ready Steady Go!, where she introduced British audiences to Motown artists including Stevie Wonder, The Supremes, and Martha and the Vandellas.[5][6]
- In 1966, Springfield topped multiple popularity polls, including Melody Maker's 'Best International Vocalist,' and became the first UK singer to top the New Musical Express readers' poll for best female singer.[3]
- Springfield's career was derailed in the 1970s and early 1980s, and by the middle of the decade she was working as a session singer in Los Angeles before her dramatic comeback with the Pet Shop Boys in 1987.[6]
