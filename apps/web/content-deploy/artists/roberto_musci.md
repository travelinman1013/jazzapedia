## Biography
Roberto Musci, born on March 27, 1956, in Milan, Italy, is a composer, performer, saxophonist, and guitarist who began his musical journey studying alto saxophone and guitar in his hometown. From 1974 to 1985, he extensively traveled the world, immersing himself in African, Indian, Near Eastern, and Far Eastern music traditions, where he made field recordings, studied diverse scales and rhythms, and collected a vast array of ethnic instruments. This period profoundly shaped his ethnomusicological approach, blending global sounds with electronics and experimental techniques upon his return to Italy.[1][2][3][5][6][8]

In the 1980s and 1990s, Musci broadcast ethnic, electronic, and experimental programs on Italian radio stations like Rai and Radio Popolare, while composing and performing music for videos, commercials, dance, theater, poetry, and live soundtracks for silent films. His debut album 'The Loa of Music' (1984) showcased field recordings fused with synthesizers, followed by the Grammy-nominated 'Water Messages' (1987) in collaboration with Giovanni Venosta. Musci's style merges free jazz, world music, concrete music inspired by Pierre Schaeffer, and avant-garde elements, often incorporating global rhythms and noises recorded during his travels.[1][2][5][6]

Throughout his career, Musci has remained active in live performances, audio-visual installations, and releases on labels like Recommended Records, Music from Memory, and Soave Records, with his latest work 'Goodbye Monsters' bridging cultural traditions and innovation. He has played with ensembles like Democratic Orchestra Milano, Nexus, Six Mobiles (named Italy's best jazz group in 1991 by Musica Jazz), and teaches a music for images course at Milan's Civic School, continuing to explore the universal language of sound.[2][6]
