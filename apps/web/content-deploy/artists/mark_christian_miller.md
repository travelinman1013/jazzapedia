## Biography
Mark Christian Miller is a vocalist, pianist, and jazz promoter based in Los Angeles who has established himself as a respected figure on the West Coast jazz scene. Born in Storm Lake, Iowa, Miller moved to Los Angeles where he developed his craft as a jazz vocalist. He came to prominence after winning a scholarship to study music full-time at Los Angeles City College, where he was discovered by Los Angeles Jazz Society founder Teri Merril-Aarons during an honors concert. This led to bookings at top venues with accomplished accompanists. Miller's vocal style is characterized by warmth, clarity, and conversational intimacy, drawing inspiration from vocal jazz artists such as Bobby Troup, Bob Dorough, Dave Frishberg, Blossom Dearie, and Mose Allison—artists known for writing clever, hip jazz melodies and lyrics.

Beyond his performing career, Miller has been instrumental in shaping Los Angeles's jazz landscape through extensive work as a music booker and promoter. He curated a seven-year Sunday night jazz series at Chaya Brasserie in Beverly Hills, programmed the summer music series at Descanso Gardens for 12 years, and has worked with prestigious festivals including the Playboy Jazz Festival at the Hollywood Bowl, the Dubai International Jazz Festival, and the LA Made series at the Grand Central Library. His 2015 album "Crazy Moon" spent four months on the national jazz radio charts and was named one of the top 15 vocal jazz albums of the year by Jazz History Online. Miller has since released "Music in the Air" (2022) and his fourth album "Strange Meadowlark," featuring legendary rhythm section members Joe LaBarbera on drums and Chuck Berghofer on bass. As a board member of The Los Angeles Jazz Society, Miller continues to support the organization's educational and music presentation activities, including the virtual concert series launched during the pandemic.
