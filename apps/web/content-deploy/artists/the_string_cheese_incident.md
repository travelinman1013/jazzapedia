## Biography
The String Cheese Incident (SCI) is a jam band formed in 1993 in the Colorado Rocky Mountains towns of Crested Butte and Telluride.[1][5] The band originated when four ski bums—Michael Kang (mandolin, violin, guitar), Bill Nershi (acoustic and lap steel guitar), Keith Moseley (bass), and Michael Travis (drums and percussion)—began jamming together after ski days, initially performing at après-ski events and local venues.[1][2] Their first official performance occurred in December 1993 at the Arts Center in Crested Butte, where they played a brief 15-minute set that generated immediate positive response.[3] Originally called "The Blue String Cheese Band" due to their blend of bluegrass and "cheesy covers," they shortened the name to The String Cheese Incident, initially viewing it as a temporary placeholder that eventually stuck as their identity.[3]

In 1996, the band relocated to Boulder, Colorado, and recruited Kyle Hollingsworth as their pianist and organist, the only formally trained jazz musician in the group and a devotee of Herbie Hancock.[1] That same year, they established SCI Fidelity Records, their independent label, and released their debut studio album *Born on the Wrong Planet*, which captured their live energy and showcased both original compositions and covers.[1] The band's commitment to artistic control and DIY ethos—including booking their own tours, recording their own albums, and managing their business operations—proved instrumental to their success.[2][3] By fall 1996, SCI had performed nearly 170 shows and made their East Coast debut.[3] Their third album, *Round the Wheel* (1998), marked a more mature sound and launched them into national touring, eventually performing over 500 shows across the country.[5]

Over three decades, The String Cheese Incident has become one of America's most significant independent bands, releasing 11 studio albums and numerous live recordings while maintaining their pioneering approach to music business and community engagement.[4][6] In 2006, the band expanded with the addition of Jason Hann on auxiliary percussion.[5] The group has been recognized for their commitment to musical creativity, integrity, community spirit, and philanthropic endeavors, establishing themselves as a cornerstone of the jam band movement.[6]

## Fun Facts
- The band's name originated as a joke when they were deciding what to call themselves; they initially chose 'The Blue String Cheese Band' because they played bluegrass and 'cheesy covers,' but shortened it to The String Cheese Incident when they realized they would continue performing.[3]
- SCI's DIY ethos was rooted in their ski bum origins; the band members would hike mountains together without ski lifts, and this backcountry mentality influenced their approach to business, leading them to perform over 220 shows per year in converted shuttle buses.[3]
- The band formed their own record label, SCI Fidelity Records, in 1996 to maintain artistic control and avoid being absorbed by major record labels, and they extended this independence to operating their own travel agency and ticketing company, eventually filing a lawsuit against Ticketmaster.[3]
- During their first official performance in December 1993 at the Arts Center in Crested Butte, the band played only a 15-minute set consisting of approximately four songs, yet the response was so positive that they immediately felt they had found the right combination of musicians and songwriting.[3]
