## Biography
St. Petersburg Ska-Jazz Review is a Russian band formed in 2001 in St. Petersburg as a spin-off project from the ska-punk band Spitfire, in collaboration with members of the Afro-Caribbean-oriented band Markscheider Kunst. The initial concept was a one-off performance at the Sergey Kuryokhin International Festival (SKIF) in April 2001, featuring jazz standards like 'Sidewinder,' 'Corcovado,' and 'Four,' alongside original ska tunes such as 'St. Thomas' and 'Man in the Street.' The lineup included Spitfire members and baritone sax and percussion players from Markscheider Kunst, and the show's success led to ongoing live gigs on the Russian club scene.[1][2]

The band's debut album was recorded in March 2002 at Dobrolet studio in St. Petersburg and released that fall on the independent label Zvezda Records. American vocalist Jennifer Davis joined soon after, contributing to their second album, 'Too Good To Be True,' recorded in April 2004 with mostly original compositions. This album appeared in Russia on Shnur'OK and internationally on Megalith Records and Grover Records, supported by tours in Germany and Switzerland. They also released a live CD/DVD, 'Live at Red Club,' in 2006.[1][2]

Blending ska, jazz, rocksteady, and polyrhythms, the band fuses improvisation, tight orchestration, Eastern and Western elements, and dynamic contrasts for energetic performances that transcend genre boundaries. Their music swings with ska's skank rhythm while incorporating jazz harmonies and hard-driving beats.[1][2]
