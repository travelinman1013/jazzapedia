## Biography
Eddy Clearwater, born Edward Harrington on January 10, 1935, in Macon, Mississippi, became a pioneering figure in the Chicago blues scene. After his family relocated to Birmingham, Alabama in 1948, he taught himself to play guitar left-handed and upside down, performing with gospel groups including the legendary Five Blind Boys of Alabama. Moving to Chicago in 1950, Clearwater worked as a dishwasher while pursuing music, quickly immersing himself in the city's vibrant blues community under the mentorship of blues star Magic Sam. By 1953, performing as Guitar Eddy, he was making a strong name for himself on Chicago's South and West Side bar circuit, meeting and learning from blues legends like Sunnyland Slim and Earl Hooker.

Clearwater's musical identity crystallized after hearing Chuck Berry in 1957, when he synthesized rock and roll elements into his blues foundation, creating a distinctive sound that would define his career. He recorded his first single, "Hill Billy Blues," in 1958 under the moniker Clear Waters—a name created by his manager Jump Jackson as a homage to Muddy Waters. Throughout the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, he built a devoted following, particularly among North Side college audiences drawn to his high-energy stage presence and individual blues-rock approach. His 1980 album *The Chief* on Rooster Blues marked a breakthrough, establishing him as a major force in Chicago blues and earning him multiple Blues Music Award nominations throughout the 1980s and 1990s.

Clearwater's later career included notable collaborations and continued recognition. In 2003, he partnered with Los Straitjackets for the album *Rock 'n' Roll City*, which earned a Grammy nomination in 2004 for Best Contemporary Blues Album. He received a Blues Music Award for Contemporary Blues Male Artist of the Year in 2001 and was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame on May 4, 2016. Clearwater continued performing until his death in June 2018 at age 83, having played at Buddy Guy's Legends club just weeks before, leaving behind a legacy as a masterful showman and innovative blues-rock musician.

## Fun Facts
