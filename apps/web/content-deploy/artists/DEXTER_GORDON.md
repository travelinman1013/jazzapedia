## Biography
Dexter Gordon was born on October 31, 1923, in New York City and became one of the most influential jazz saxophonists of the 20th century.[2] He began his musical journey at age 13 with clarinet, switching to alto saxophone at 15 and finally settling on tenor saxophone at 17.[2] After studying under multi-instrumentalist Lloyd Reese and Sam Browne at Jefferson High School in Los Angeles, Gordon joined Lionel Hampton's big band in 1940, where he toured extensively and made his first broadcast recordings.[1][2] In 1944, he worked with Louis Armstrong's orchestra—a pivotal moment that inspired him deeply—before joining Billy Eckstine's groundbreaking bebop band later that year.[1][2] It was with Eckstine that Gordon forged his unique musical voice, bridging swing and bebop by combining Lester Young's silky tone with Charlie Parker's melodic athleticism, while seasoning his solos with distinctive quotes from other songs.[1]

Gordon's career flourished in the late 1940s as he became widely regarded as the first musician to translate bebop language to the tenor saxophone.[4] His 1947 collaboration with tenor saxophonist Wardell Gray on "The Chase" became a historic bestseller for Dial Records and established him as a major recording artist.[2][4] Throughout the late 1940s, he performed on New York's famous 52nd Street alongside bebop innovators including Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, and Max Roach.[2] The 1950s proved challenging due to heroin addiction and legal issues, but Gordon's career revitalized in the 1960s through collaborations with Blue Note Records, where he recorded classics with musicians like Freddie Hubbard and Bud Powell while exploring modal playing and hard bop.[2] After fourteen years living in Europe, Gordon returned to America in 1976 for his celebrated "Homecoming" concert at New York's Village Vanguard, which was recorded and released by Columbia Records.[1][2] He received numerous accolades including Downbeat Musician of the Year in 1978 and 1980, induction into the Jazz Hall of Fame in 1980, and a National Endowment for the Arts Lifetime Achievement Award.[2] Gordon died on September 19, 1991, in Los Angeles at age 67.[3]

## Fun Facts
- Gordon was praised directly by Louis Armstrong, who told him 'Son, I really liked that sound you get,' marking a significant moment of validation early in his career.[1]
- Despite being fired from Billy Eckstine's band in 1945 due to drug-related unreliability, Gordon continued to record and went on to become one of jazz's most celebrated figures, demonstrating remarkable resilience and artistic growth.[1]
- In his famous 1947 collaboration 'The Chase' with Wardell Gray, Gordon noted that the two tenor saxophonists' styles were so complementary that 'it was sometimes hard for him to tell where one left off and the other began.'[4]
- Gordon's 1976 return to America after 14 years in Europe was marked by a sold-out New York concert dubbed 'The Homecoming,' which was recorded and released by Columbia Records, symbolizing his triumphant re-entry into the American jazz scene.[1]
