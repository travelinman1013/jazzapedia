## Biography
Theophilus Musa London, born on February 23, 1987, in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, moved to New York City at a young age and grew up in Brooklyn, graduating from George Westinghouse High School in 2006. Emerging from Brooklyn's underground scene, he began his music career in 2007 with mixtapes like JAM! (2008) and This Charming Man (2009), which showcased his genre-blurring style fusing alternative hip hop, electropop, R&B, soul-pop, post-punk, and electronic elements. His sound draws from influences such as Michael Jackson, Prince, Marvin Gaye, Kraftwerk, and The Smiths, blending fashion-forward flair with introspective lyricism and infectious grooves.[1][2][3]
