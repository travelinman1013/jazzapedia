## Biography
The Melbourne Ska Orchestra (MSO) is a large ska ensemble formed in 2003 in Melbourne, Australia, led by bandleader Nicky Bomba, known for his work with Bomba, Bustamento, and the John Butler Trio. The group originated from a world-record attempt for the largest number of horn players performing the ska-skank at St Kilda's Gershwin Room, which evolved into an annual event celebrating ska's history, starting with Millie Small’s 1963 hit 'My Boy Lollipop'. Comprising 17 to 35 members from diverse multicultural backgrounds including Scottish, Venezuelan, Trinidadian, Maltese, and English influences, MSO blends traditional ska, rocksteady, and ska punk with original compositions and unexpected arrangements, drawing from Jamaican origins, UK Two Tone, and Latino ska for a uniquely Australian sound full of cinematic energy and powerful horns.[1][2][3][5]

MSO's career gained momentum through sold-out shows, festival appearances like WOMAdelaide, Byron Bay Bluesfest, and Splendour in the Grass, and international tours including the UK, US, Mexico, and Turkey. Their debut self-titled album arrived in 2013 via Four Four Records, followed by Sierra Kilo Alpha in 2016, which won an ARIA Award for Best World Music Album. Subsequent releases like Saturn Return (2017), Ska Classics (2018), and singles up to 2024 solidified their reputation, with nominations and wins at ARIA Awards highlighting their live energy and genre innovation.[1][2][5]

MSO's legacy lies in revitalizing ska in Australia, capturing raw live energy in recordings while experimenting with hybrids that reflect local stories, such as Melbourne's underbelly in tracks like 'Lygon Street Meltdown'. Their multicultural lineup and commitment to both covers and originals have made them a fixture in the ska and reggae scene, influencing contemporary audiences with vibrant, foot-stomping performances.[1][2][5]
