## Biography
Ryland Peter 'Ry' Cooder was born on March 15, 1947, in Los Angeles, California, and raised in Santa Monica, where he showed early musical talent, introduced to the guitar at age three and proficient by age eight. A childhood accident paradoxically sparked his career, leading him to thrive on the L.A. folk and blues scene by his mid-teens as a multi-instrumentalist skilled on guitar, mandolin, and banjo. He briefly attended Reed College in Portland, Oregon, in the 1960s but dropped out after lucrative session work, including with Captain Beefheart, and graduated from Santa Monica High School in 1964.[1][3][4][6][7]

Cooder's career took off in 1965 with the formation of the Rising Sons alongside Taj Mahal and drummer Ed Cassidy, though the band disbanded after their album was shelved; this led to session work with producer Terry Melcher, Paul Revere and the Raiders, the Rolling Stones on 'Let It Bleed,' and nearly replacing Brian Jones before clashes with Keith Richards. His 1970 self-titled debut album showcased his signature patchwork of Americana, drawing from country, gospel, blues, and beyond, launching a series of Reprise albums exploring American roots music. He became renowned for film scores starting in the late 1970s, including 'The Long Riders' and later 'Paris, Texas,' 'Alamo Bay,' and 'Crossroads,' while collaborations like Little Village (1991-1992) with John Hiatt, Nick Lowe, and Jim Keltner added to his oeuvre.[1][2][3][4][5][6]

Cooder's musical style blends diverse genres—blues, country blues, Americana, country rock—with global influences, evident in Grammy-winning world music projects like 'A Meeting by the River' (1993) with V.M. Bhatt, 'Talking Timbuktu' (1994) with Ali Farka Touré, and producing the blockbuster 'Buena Vista Social Club' (1997), which spawned a hit documentary. Later works include the California-themed trilogy 'Chávez Ravine' (2005), 'My Name Is Buddy' (2007), and 'I, Flathead' (2008), alongside 'San Patricio' (2010) with the Chieftains. Ranked among the greatest guitarists by Rolling Stone and Gibson, his legacy lies in bridging roots music with international sounds, earning multiple Grammys despite limited commercial solo success.[2][3][4]
