## Biography
The Treme Brass Band, a traditional New Orleans marching brass band, was founded around 1990 by snare drummer Benny Jones Sr., who drew from musicians participating in weekly jam sessions at Sidney's Saloon in the Tremé neighborhood. Jones, raised in the Tremé area during the 1950s and 1960s, was immersed in New Orleans brass band culture from childhood, inspired by jazz funerals, parades, and social aid and pleasure clubs where his father and other musicians performed. Prior to forming the band, Jones played drums in the Olympia Brass Band and led the Dirty Dozen Brass Band and Chosen Few Brass Band, bringing his deep roots in traditional styles to the group, which he co-led with bass drummer and grand marshal 'Uncle' Lionel Batiste Sr. until Batiste's death in 2012.[1][2][3][4][5]
