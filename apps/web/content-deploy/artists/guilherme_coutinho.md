## Biography
Guilherme Coutinho (1942–1983) was a Brazilian pianist, composer, keyboard player, singer, and bandleader born in Belém do Pará, a city in northern Brazil at the mouth of the Amazon River. He began playing music at the age of five and by seventeen was leading groups and performing in local nightclubs, establishing himself as a prominent figure in the regional scene. Little is known about his early life beyond these details, but his career centered in Belém, where he developed a unique style blending lo-fi funk, Brazilian tropicalia, samba, MPB (música popular brasileira), bossa nova, and American jazz influences.[1][2][3][4]

In 1978, Coutinho released his sole known album, *Guilherme Coutinho e o Grupo Stalo*, pressed at an obscure local plant on the Erla - Estudio Rauland label. The record showcases his technical prowess on keyboards and vocals across tracks like the bossa nova opener 'Atalaia' with theremin-like melodies and wah-wah effects, the funky 'As Feras,' upbeat samba in 'Macaréu' and 'Fuga,' and a 7-minute jazz improvisation 'Tema Pro Alvarito' evoking a Rhodes electric piano trio. This lo-fi yet sophisticated fusion has earned cult status in underground Brazilian music circles, repressed by labels like MR BONGO.[2][5][6]

Coutinho passed away in 1983 at age 41, leaving a limited but highly regarded legacy as an elusive innovator whose work from Brazil's Amazonian periphery captured diverse genres in a surprising, technical package. His music remains a rare treasure, appreciated for bridging northern Brazilian sounds with broader influences.
