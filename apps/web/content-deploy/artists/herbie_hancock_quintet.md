## Biography
Herbert Jeffrey 'Herbie' Hancock, born April 12, 1940, in Chicago, Illinois, was a child piano prodigy who performed a Mozart piano concerto with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra at age 11. After graduating from Grinnell College in 1960, he joined trumpeter Donald Byrd's group, which led to his signing with Blue Note Records. His 1963 debut album Takin' Off was an immediate success, featuring the hit 'Watermelon Man.' In 1963, Miles Davis personally invited Hancock to join his Second Great Quintet alongside Wayne Shorter, Ron Carter, and Tony Williams, where he helped redefine jazz rhythm sections and contributed to classics like ESP, Nefertiti, and Sorcerer over five years.[1][2][3][4]
