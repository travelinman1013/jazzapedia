## Biography
Fishbone is an American rock band formed in 1979 in Los Angeles, California, by a group of junior high school students from South Central Los Angeles who met Angelo Moore through a school busing program to the San Fernando Valley. The original lineup included bassist John Norwood Fisher, his brother Philip 'Fish' Fisher on drums, Angelo Moore on vocals and saxophones, guitarist Kendall Jones, trumpeter 'Dirty' Walter A. Kibby II, and Christopher Dowd on keyboards and trombone. Emerging from diverse backgrounds, they rejected gangster culture and fused ska, punk, funk, metal, reggae, and soul into a high-energy sound that broke into the predominantly white punk scene via explosive live shows at venues like Madame Wong's.[1][2][5]

Signed to Columbia Records in 1983 after being spotted by Brian O'Neal of The BusBoys, Fishbone released their debut EP in 1985 and full-length album *In Your Face* in 1986, gaining traction with tours opening for Beastie Boys and performances like 'Jamaica Ska' in *Back to the Beach*. Their 1988 album *Truth and Soul* earned critical acclaim for blending ska-funk with sharp social commentary on racism, oppression, and family breakdown, while *The Reality of My Surroundings* (1991) hit No. 49 on the Billboard chart with MTV hits like 'Everyday Sunshine' directed by Spike Lee. The band evolved toward guitar-driven rock and soul, achieving cult status but facing lineup changes after peak success in the late 1980s and early 1990s.[1][4][5]

Throughout the 2000s and 2010s, John Norwood Fisher and Angelo Moore remained core members amid departures, with partial original lineup reunions for tours commemorating albums like *Chim Chim's Badass Revenge*. Recent shifts include Philip Fisher's 2016 return and 2023 exits of Fisher and Kibby due to creative disputes, leaving Moore as the sole continuous member. Fishbone's legacy endures as pioneers of genre fusion, influencing alternative rock despite commercial challenges and internal conflicts.[1][2]
