## Biography
The New Orleans BINGO! Show is an interactive theatrical cabaret and musical band originating from New Orleans, Louisiana, created in 2002 by singer/songwriter Clint Maedgen. The project began when Maedgen and Ron “Ronnie Numbers” Rona, who were working together at a restaurant in the French Quarter, started performing weekly Thursday night shows at Fiorella's on Decatur Street from 8pm to 11pm. These performances featured Maedgen on saxophone alongside a repertoire of up to 150 songs, blending musical performance with participatory theater that appealed to a wide audience aged roughly 27 to 67, creating an insulated bubble of experimental energy among New Orleans' youngest and most innovative artists.[1][2][4][5][6]

The band's musical style initially centered on rhythm and blues with theatrical elements, later transitioning to rock 'n' roll with new casts of characters, while maintaining its core as an interactive cabaret featuring original music by Maedgen. The shows gained notice from Preservation Hall's Ben Jaffe, who attended performances and was struck by their quintessential New Orleans vibe, leading to Maedgen's eventual involvement with Preservation Hall. This exposure highlighted the Bingo! Show's role in shaking up traditional jazz scenes through multimedia and approachable, personable performances amid the vibrant, non-judgmental New Orleans music ecosystem of the early 2000s.[2][3]

Though specific details on the band's lasting legacy are limited in available sources, its influence helped bridge experimental cabaret with established institutions like Preservation Hall, contributing to the evolution of New Orleans' live music culture. The show represented a playful, community-driven extension of the city's musical heritage, fostering collaborations and audience participation that embodied the pre-Katrina creative openness.[2]
