## Biography
Jordan Smart, a folk singer-songwriter, was born in Cleveland, Ohio, and raised in the rolling hills of rural Northeast Ohio. Growing up with humble beginnings, he hitchhiked across the United States, slept under bridges, and faced life-threatening experiences that shaped his raw, sincere songwriting. Now in his mid-30s and a father, Smart draws from these adventures to craft lyrics blending wit, emotion, and social commentary, often evoking timeless imagery from his travels and upbringing.[1][2][5]

Smart's career gained momentum in the folk revival scene, performing in dive bars, mountain festivals, and notably opening for Senator Bernie Sanders during his 2016 and 2017 presidential campaign rallies. His debut full-length album, *Heart of It All*, released in fall 2017, marked a milestone, followed by releases like *Quiet Skies Vol. 1* (2023 benefit album) and the protest-focused *Confessions of a CEO* (September 2025), addressing Gaza, policing, healthcare, and activism. His Dylanesque vocals, fingerpicking influenced by John Fahey and The Tallest Man on Earth, and storytelling have earned acclaim, including a 2023 Gems in the Rough top prize for 'Apple Don’t Fall'. Currently based in Ludlow or Latonia, Kentucky, he continues touring and advocating for social justice.[1][2][4][5][7]

Smart's musical style is raw folk with protest elements echoing Woody Guthrie and Nina Simone, covering personal themes like addiction, parenthood, and humor (e.g., songs about pickles), alongside scathing political satire. His legacy lies in authentic troubadour traditions, turning life experiences and activism into accessible anthems that resonate globally, building a dedicated following without mainstream fame.[4][5][6]
