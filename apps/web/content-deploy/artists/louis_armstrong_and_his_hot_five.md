## Biography
Louis Armstrong and His Hot Five was formed as a studio recording ensemble in Chicago, with their first session on November 12, 1925, for OKeh Records, marking a pivotal moment in jazz history. Led by cornetist and trumpeter Louis Armstrong, the original lineup featured his wife Lillian Hardin Armstrong on piano, Johnny Dodds on clarinet, Kid Ory on trombone, and Johnny St. Cyr on banjo. These musicians, rooted in New Orleans jazz traditions, primarily recorded together in studios rather than performing live, producing over 50 tracks between 1925 and 1928 that shifted jazz from collective ensemble playing to individualistic improvisation, highlighted by Armstrong's groundbreaking solos.[1][4]

The group's recordings evolved over time, with lineup changes including a brief Hot Seven phase in 1927 adding tuba and drums, and a 1928 reconfiguration incorporating members from the Carroll Dickerson Orchestra such as Earl Hines on piano, Fred Robinson on trombone, Jimmy Strong on clarinet and tenor sax, Mancy Carr on banjo, and Zutty Singleton on drums. Iconic tracks like 'Potato Head Blues,' 'West End Blues,' 'Weather Bird,' 'Heebie Jeebies,' and 'Muskrat Ramble' showcased Armstrong's innovative trumpet solos, scat singing, and swing feel, elevating jazz into a soloist's art form and influencing generations.[1][2][4]

Though never a full touring band, the Hot Five's relaxed, creative sessions laid the foundation for modern jazz, propelling Armstrong to fame and transitioning him toward broader popularity by 1928-1929, when he moved back to New York for stage shows like 'Hot Chocolates.' Their legacy endures as transformative works that redefined American music during a period of social change.[1][2][5]
