## Biography
Yoskar Sarante, born on January 2, 1970, in Villas Agrícolas, Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, was the second child of Domingo Sarante and Ramona Ventura, and the first in his family to pursue music professionally. As a child, he sang in parks and public squares accompanied by his father's guitar to earn a living, and participated in children's singing competitions like 'Mundo Infantil' on Color Vision. To fund music lessons at the Iris del Valle School of Music, he worked in construction. His early career focused on merengue, starting with the International Grupo Melao, followed by orchestras led by Tomás Barrera, Cheche Abreu, Aramis Camilo, and Guancho Viloria, where he gained fame with the hit 'Ametrállalo'. Transitioning to bachata in the 1990s, Sarante became a key figure in the 'nueva bachata' movement, known for his romantic songs, unique voice, and fusion of traditional bachata with contemporary elements, releasing hits under J&N Records and appearing on compilations like Bachata Tipico and The Rough Guide to Bachata.

Sarante's popularity extended across Latin countries with emotionally charged lyrics and soulful performances, earning him the nickname 'El Prabu'. He performed internationally, including at New York Mets stadium, and released enduring albums like '18 Éxitos Inmortales' and 'Legacy Mix The Album'. A devoted family man and religious individual, he emphasized honesty and family values. Tragically, Sarante passed away on January 28, 2019, in Orlando, Florida, at age 49, leaving a lasting legacy as one of the most popular bachata singers from the Dominican Republic.
