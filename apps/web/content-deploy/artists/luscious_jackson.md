## Biography
Luscious Jackson is an American alternative rock band formed in 1991 in New York City by childhood friends Jill Cunniff (vocals, bass), Gabby Glaser (vocals, guitar), and Kate Schellenbach (drums), who were later joined by Vivian Trimble (keyboards, vocals). Emerging from the vibrant early 1980s Lower Manhattan street scene, the members snuck into clubs as teenagers, absorbing eclectic influences from hip-hop, punk, and alternative music alongside future Beastie Boys members. Schellenbach, a founding drummer for the Beastie Boys, left them after their shift to hip-hop and reunited with Cunniff and Glazer to form the band, named after Philadelphia 76ers basketball player Lucious 'Luke' Jackson. Their debut EP, In Search of Manny (1992), was recorded in a friend's basement and released on the Beastie Boys' Grand Royal label, establishing their quirky fusion of hip-hop rhythms, brooding basslines, rock grooves, funk, and mysterious harmonies.[1][2][3][5]

The band gained traction touring with acts like the Breeders and Urge Overkill, releasing full-length albums Natural Ingredients (1994), Fever In Fever Out (1996), which featured their biggest hit 'Naked Eye' peaking at #36 on the Billboard Hot 100, and Electric Honey (1999). Their sound reflected the diverse NYC club culture they grew up in, blending genres without boundaries. Trimble departed in 1998, and the group disbanded as a trio in 2000 after Cunniff chose to start a family, though they reunited briefly in 2011, releasing Magic Hour and Baby DJ in 2013 before ceasing activity.[2][3]

Luscious Jackson's legacy endures as a quintessential '90s NYC act, embodying the alt-punk-hip-hop crossover with playful, genre-defying music that captured the era's East Village cool. Their independent spirit, honed in rent-stabilized rehearsal spaces amid urban hardships, influenced the alternative scene, and compilations like their 2007 greatest hits keep their catalog alive.[2][3][5]
