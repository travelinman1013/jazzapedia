## Biography
Louis Armstrong, born in New Orleans around 1901 (exact year disputed), grew up in poverty and faced early hardship, including arrest for firing a blank gun and time in a juvenile detention center where he honed his cornet skills. He played on Mississippi riverboats, which led to mentorship under bandleader King Oliver in Chicago starting in 1922. There, Armstrong met pianist Lil Hardin, whom he married in 1924; she encouraged him to leave Oliver's band, briefly join Fletcher Henderson in New York, and return to Chicago to lead his own recordings. In late 1925, under Okeh Records, he formed the Hot Five—a studio group featuring Armstrong on cornet/trumpet and vocals, Lil Hardin on piano, Kid Ory on trombone, Johnny Dodds on clarinet, and Johnny St. Cyr on banjo/guitar—revolutionizing jazz by emphasizing improvised solos over ensemble playing and introducing scat singing in tracks like 'Heebie Jeebies' and 'Gut Bucket Blues.'

In May 1927, the group expanded to the Hot Seven for five sessions, adding Pete Briggs on tuba and Baby Dodds on drums, with John Thomas or Erskine Tate later on trombone; they recorded influential sides like 'Wild Man Blues' and 'Melancholy Blues.' Armstrong's style featured virtuosic cornet solos, expressive vocals, and swing rhythm, shifting jazz toward soloist prominence. By 1928, the lineup changed again, including Earl Hines on piano, amid Armstrong's rising fame and eventual separation from Hardin in 1931. These sessions (1925-1928), totaling around 89 recordings, marked his emergence as a bandleader and soloist.

The Hot Five and Seven recordings transformed jazz history, earning induction into the National Recording Registry in 2002 and inclusion of 'Melancholy Blues' on NASA's Voyager Golden Record in 1977. Armstrong's legacy as 'Satchmo' extended to global ambassadorship, pop hits, films, and halls of fame in jazz, R&B, and rock.
