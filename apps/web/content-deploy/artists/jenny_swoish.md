## Biography
Jenny Swoish is a Southern California native, born and raised in Orange County, where she began her musical journey at a young age. Starting piano lessons and musical theatre at age four, she studied piano, theater, voice, and dance, performing stage versions of works by George Gershwin and other composers. This early training laid the foundation for her career in big band music.[3][5]

Swoish developed her career as a vocalist in the revival Glenn Miller Orchestra, formed in 1956 to perpetuate the style of the original Glenn Miller Orchestras from the 1930s and 1940s. Joining as the female vocalist, she performs alongside music director Erik Stabnau, handling male vocals, in a band that plays classic Glenn Miller arrangements and big band swing. Her role involves delivering the female vocal parts in this longstanding ensemble, which continues to tour and record into the 21st century.[1][2]

Her musical style is rooted in big band jazz and swing, characterized by the Glenn Miller Orchestra's sound, including hits from the vintage era. As a current member listed as of 2022, Swoish contributes to the orchestra's legacy of preserving this genre through live performances and recordings.[1][4]
