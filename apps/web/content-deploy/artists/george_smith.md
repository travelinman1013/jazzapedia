## Biography
George 'Harmonica' Smith, born Allen George Smith on April 22, 1924, in Helena, Arkansas (or nearby West Helena), and raised in Cairo, Illinois, learned harmonica from his mother Jessie at age four. As a teenager, he traveled the South, playing fish fries and picnics in the Mississippi Delta with Early Woods' country band, joined the Jackson Jubilee Singers gospel group, and performed on streets. In 1941, he moved to Rock Island, Illinois, working non-musically while experimenting with amplified harmonica via a salvaged projector at the Dixie Theatre in Itta Bena, Mississippi.[1][3][5]

Smith moved to Chicago in 1949, playing with Otis Rush and the Myers Brothers, then joined Muddy Waters' band after Henry Strong's death, though stylistic differences led him to leave by 1954 for Kansas City's Orchid Room. Signed to Modern/RPM by Joe Bihari, he recorded classics like 'Blues in the Dark' and 'Telephone Blues,' noted for octave playing, tone shadings, and swing behind the beat, earning him 'Father of West Coast Swing.' Touring with Champion Jack Dupree and Little Willie John in 1955, he settled in Los Angeles, recording under aliases amid rock 'n' roll's rise, later rejoining Muddy Waters briefly in 1966, forming Southside Blues Band (later Bacon Fat) with Rod Piazza, and backing Big Mama Thornton.[1][2][3][4][5]

His style blended Delta blues with swing and R&B, influencing West Coast blues harmonica. Health declined from heart issues in the 1970s; he taught chromatic harmonica to William Clarke. Smith died October 2, 1983, in Los Angeles, remembered for Muddy Waters and Thornton work, solo albums like 'A Tribute to Little Walter' (1968), and Blues Hall of Fame induction.[3][5]
