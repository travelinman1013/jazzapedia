## Biography
Seyi Vibez (Balogun Afolabi Oluwaloseyi, born 12 July 2000 in Ketu, Lagos State, Nigeria) and Omah Lay (Omah Stanley Didia, born 19 May 1997 in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, Nigeria) are two prominent Nigerian Afrobeats artists known for their emotional, street-inspired soundscapes blending afrobeats, afrofusion, and introspective storytelling. Seyi Vibez grew up in Ikorodu, Lagos, debuting in 2019 with 'Anybody' and gaining traction in 2020 via 'Godsent,' leading to albums like *No Seyi No Vibez* (2021) and *Billion Dollar Baby* (2022), which topped Nigerian charts with hits like 'Chance (Na Ham).' Omah Lay started in a rap group as 'Lil Street King,' transitioned to solo work in 2019 with 'Do Not Disturb,' and broke through with his EP *Get Layd* (2020), featuring 'Bad Influence,' followed by *Boy Alone* (2022), earning critical acclaim for its Afrofusion style.[3][1]

Both artists rose rapidly in Nigeria's Afrobeats scene, with Seyi Vibez winning Headies awards for Best Street-Hop Artiste (2023) and collaborating internationally on *FUJI MOTO* (2024) with Olamide, French Montana, and others, while Omah Lay secured Next Rated at the 2021 Headies, released *What Have We Done* (2020), and toured North America. Their musical styles emphasize vulnerability—Seyi Vibez's raw street narratives and Omah Lay's soulful production—contributing to Afrobeats' global evolution through streaming dominance and awards like AFRIMA nominations.[3][1][2]

Together, they represent a new wave of Afrobeats innovation, with their 2024 collaboration 'My Healer' merging Seyi Vibez's heartfelt verses and Omah Lay's emotive vocals into a healing anthem, building on over 300 million streams each and solidifying their legacy in emotional, genre-blending African music.[2]
