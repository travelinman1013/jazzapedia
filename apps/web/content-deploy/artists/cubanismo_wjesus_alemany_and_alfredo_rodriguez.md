## Biography
Cubanismo! w/Jesus Alemany & Alfredo Rodriguez refers to the seminal 1996 album 'Jesús Alemañy's ¡Cubanismo! Featuring Alfredo Rodríguez,' a landmark project in Afro-Cuban jazz and son cubano revival led by trumpeter Jesús Alemany with pianist Alfredo Rodríguez as a featured artist. Jesús Alemany, born in Cuba, began his musical journey at age 13 with Grupo Musical Aimara and studied at the Conservatorio Amadeo Roldan alongside future stars like Jorge Maza and Lazarito Valdés. By 15, he joined Sierra Maestra, and in 1980 played with Gonzalo Rubalcaba's Grupo Proyecto. In December 1994, Alemany participated in a Paris tribute to conguero Patato Valdés organized by Alfredo Rodríguez, where producer Joe Boyd heard them and commissioned the Cubanismo! album, recorded in Havana with an all-star lineup blending traditional Cuban rhythms like mambo, cha-cha-chá, bolero, danzón, and son with modern sounds[1][2][4].

Alfredo Rodríguez (1936–2005), born in Havana, drew early influences from Cuban pianists like Lili Martínez, Jesús López, Rubén González, Guillermo Rubalcaba, and José 'Pepesito' Reyes Núñez, as well as orchestras such as Aragón, América, and Arsenio Rodríguez. Leaving Cuba in 1960, he built his career in New York with groups like Sonora Matancera, Ismael Rivera, and Joe Cuba, before moving to Paris in 1983 for greater success. The Cubanismo! sessions marked Rodríguez's first return to Cuba since 1960, followed by his acclaimed album Cuba Linda with some of the same musicians. Cubanismo! launched as a one-off project but evolved into a touring band under Alemany, achieving massive success with over 250,000 copies sold and critical acclaim across Billboard and Afropop[1][2][3][4].

The group's style epitomizes 'Cubanismo'—uniquely Cuban expressions rooted in 1950s big band wind sounds, updated for global stages. Alemany continued leading Cubanismo! through tours worldwide, releasing albums like Acuarela Cubana in 2025, while Rodríguez's participation cemented his legacy in Latin jazz until his death in 2005 shortly after an Africando collaboration[1][2][6].
