## Biography
Orishas is a Cuban hip-hop group formed in Havana, Cuba, in 1999 by Roldán González Rivero, Ruzzo Medina (Hiram), Yotuel Romero, and initially Flaco-Pro and Livan Nuñez, evolving from the earlier group Amenaza. The members, seeking to blend hip-hop with traditional Cuban rhythms amid a youth culture craving African-American influences, relocated to France where they signed a record deal and released their debut album *A lo Cubano* in 1999, fusing hip-hop rhymes with son cubano, bolero, rumba, bembé, and Yoruba elements to create a unique sound celebrating black Cuban identity.[1][2][3] This innovative style propelled them to international acclaim, earning a Latin Grammy nomination and tours across Europe, the US, Canada, South Africa, Brazil, Mexico, and a triumphant return to Cuba in 2000, where they topped radio charts and performed for tens of thousands.[1][2]

Their career progressed with albums like *Emigrante* (2002), produced with Niko Noki and featuring top Cuban musicians at EMI Paris, exploring deeper themes influenced by global travels, followed by *El Kilo* (2005) and *Cosita Buena* (2008), solidifying their status in Latin hip-hop and alternative scenes.[1][2][7] Flaco-Pro departed in 2002, leaving the core trio of Roldán (Paris), Ruzzo (Milan), and Yotuel (Madrid), who became pioneers in Spanish-language urban music, sharing stages with diverse acts like Cypress Hill, Compay Segundo, and Buena Vista Social Club peers, and participating in events like Paz Sin Fronteras II in 2009.[2][3][4] After a hiatus from 2009-2016, they reunited amid rising urbano interest, having toured over 80 countries and earned two Grammys, including for *Emigrante*.[3][4][7]

Orishas' legacy lies in bridging Cuban traditions with hip-hop, putting Spanish urban music on the global map—ranked #5 by Billboard in 2023 among influential urban artists—and fostering conversations on Afro-Cuban identity, while influencing the integration of Yoruba culture in modern fusions.[2][3][4]

## Fun Facts
- Originally named 'Afrocuban Orishas Underground de La Habana,' shortened to Orishas because it wouldn't fit on the album cover.[4]
- In 1999, Fidel Castro hosted a party and met with them—the first Cuban government endorsement of hip-hop.[2]
- Their name directly links to Yoruba orishas (deities), reflected in songs like 'Nací Orichas' and 'Canto Para Elewa Y Changó,' emphasizing African diaspora ties.[2]
- Performed at elite festivals headlining with Deftones and Cypress Hill at Lowlands, and alongside Tool and Wyclef Jean at Roskilde.[1]
