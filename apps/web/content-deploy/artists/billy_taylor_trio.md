## Biography
Billy Taylor (July 24, 1921 – December 28, 2010) was an American jazz pianist, composer, broadcaster, and educator who became one of the most influential figures in jazz history. Born in Greenville, North Carolina, to a dentist father and schoolteacher mother, Taylor moved to New York City in 1944 after earning a degree in Music from Virginia State College. He quickly established himself on the legendary 52nd Street jazz scene, playing with Ben Webster's Quartet and meeting Art Tatum, who became his mentor. Taylor's versatility allowed him to seamlessly transition from swing to bebop, and he became the house pianist at the iconic Birdland jazz club around 1949-1951, where he performed longer than any other pianist in the venue's history, backing legends including Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie, and John Coltrane.

Beyond his work as a sideman, Taylor formed the Billy Taylor Trio in the early 1950s, initially with bassist Charles Mingus and drummer Marquis Foster, later evolving with various jazz greats. He was a prolific recording artist, releasing albums such as 'Billy Taylor Piano' (1945), 'Piano Panorama' (1951), and 'Jazz At Storyville' (1952). Taylor's influence extended far beyond the bandstand—he was a pioneering jazz educator, establishing Jazzmobile in 1964 to promote jazz through educational programs, and served as music director for The David Frost Show from 1969 to 1972, becoming the first African American to lead a talk-show band. He also founded The Jazz Foundation of America in 1989 to support elderly jazz and blues musicians.

Taylor's legacy encompasses numerous accolades including two Peabody Awards, an Emmy, a Grammy, and induction into the Hall of Fame for the International Association of Jazz Educators. Critic Leonard Feather called him 'the world's foremost spokesman for jazz.' Throughout his career, Taylor championed jazz as both an art form and cultural ambassador, lecturing worldwide and advocating for the music's recognition and preservation until his death on December 28, 2010.
