## Biography
Sam Cooke was born on January 22, 1931, in Clarksdale, Mississippi, and grew up as one of seven to eight children in a musical family.[2][3][7] His father formed a gospel group called the Singing Children with four of his siblings in the 1930s, introducing Sam to music from an early age.[3][5] As a teenager, Sam joined the Teenage Highway QCs, a local gospel quartet, where he served as second lead singer.[6] At age 19, he was hand-picked by Roy Crain, manager of the Soul Stirrers, to replace the legendary R.H. Harris as lead singer in January 1951.[2][3][4] During his six years with the Soul Stirrers (1951-1957), Cooke established a new standard for gospel expression with his distinctive light, lilting vocal style.[8] Major gospel hits included "Touch The Hem of His Garment" (1956), "Jesus, Wash Away My Troubles" (1956), and "Nearer to Thee" (1955), which Aretha Franklin described as "perfectly chiseled jewels."[8]

In 1956, Cooke began recording secular music under the pseudonym Dale Cooke, but his distinctive voice was too recognizable, leading to backlash and his departure from the Soul Stirrers.[5] On June 17, 1957, producer Bumps Blackwell left Specialty Records with the masters of "You Send Me" and signed with the newly-formed Keen Records, where Cooke achieved massive commercial success.[6] His crossover from gospel to secular music was revolutionary—rather than simply "crossing over," Cooke "combined" sensuality with spirituality, blending sophistication and soul.[4] After the success of "You Send Me" in 1957, he signed with the William Morris Agency and went on to become one of the most influential soul artists of all time, earning the title "King of Soul."[4][9]

## Fun Facts
- Sam Cooke added the 'e' to his surname (Cook) years after birth; he was originally known as Sam Cook.[3][6]
- When Cooke attempted to record his first pop song "Loveable" in 1956, he recorded it under the pseudonym Dale Cooke to avoid backlash from the gospel community, but his distinctive voice was too recognizable and fans immediately knew it was him.[5]
- On June 17, 1957, producer Bumps Blackwell walked out of Specialty Records with the masters of "You Send Me" and "Summertime" under his arm and a check for $1,500, having waived all future royalties from his previous productions, and went directly to the newly-formed Keen Records.[6]
- Cooke's birth year was often incorrectly reported as 1935 for many years; his actual birth date was January 22, 1931.[3]
