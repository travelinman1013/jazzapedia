## Biography
Ndeh Ntumazah was born in 1926 in Mankon, Bamenda, Cameroon, and emerged as a key figure in the pro-independence movement during the 1950s. He joined the Union of the Peoples of Cameroon (UPC) in the early 1950s, and after the UPC was banned in French-controlled Eastern Cameroon in 1955, he founded the One Kamerun Movement (OK) in British-controlled Southern Cameroons as a disguised continuation of the UPC, serving as its president. From this base, he supported UPC militants like Ruben Um Nyobé and Ernest Ouandié in their guerrilla activities against French colonial forces.[1][2]

Following Cameroon's unification in 1961, Ntumazah fled into exile in 1962, living in Ghana, Guinea, Algeria, and eventually the United Kingdom under aliases like Mbarack Ben Ibrahim. In exile until 1991, he advocated internationally for Cameroon's liberation through writings, conferences, and deputations, navigating UPC internal splits influenced by global events like the Sino-Soviet divide. His rhetoric often reflected communist influences, though he was not formally a communist.[1][2]

Returning to Cameroon amid multi-party democracy in 1991, Ntumazah rejoined UPC leadership but faced party divisions, leading a radical faction against moderates like Augustin Frédéric Kodock. He remained active until his death on January 21, 2010, in London at age 83, receiving an official state burial in Bamenda on March 27, 2010, honoring his role in independence and reunification.[1][2][4]
