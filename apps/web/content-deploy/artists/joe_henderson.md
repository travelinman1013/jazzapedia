## Biography
Joe Henderson was born on April 24, 1937, in Lima, Ohio, into a family of fifteen children.[4] He began playing saxophone at age eight, encouraged by his older brother who admired Lester Young.[4] A high school music teacher introduced him to the tenor saxophone, and by high school he was already involved in arranging for bands.[3] Henderson attended Kentucky State College before moving to Detroit in 1956 to study at Wayne State University, where he developed his skills under renowned teacher Larry Teal and studied alongside future jazz greats Yusef Lateef, Donald Byrd, and Barry Harris.[2][4] By age 18, he was active on the Detroit jazz scene, playing in jam sessions with visiting New York City stars and transcribing so many Lester Young solos that his professors believed he had perfect pitch.[2]

After enlisting in the US Army from 1960 to 1962, where he led several jazz groups and toured Europe and Japan,[1] Henderson moved to New York and quickly established himself as a leading voice in jazz. He met trumpeter Kenny Dorham at Birdland while sitting in with Dexter Gordon, and Dorham championed him and arranged his first recording session as a leader.[1][2] This resulted in *Page One* (1963), which remains one of his most critically acclaimed albums and spawned the jazz standard "Blue Bossa."[1] During the 1960s, Henderson became a prolific session musician for Blue Note Records, appearing on close to thirty albums as a valued sideman on landmark recordings including Horace Silver's *Song for My Father*, Lee Morgan's *The Sidewinder*, Grant Green's *Idle Moments*, and Herbie Hancock's *The Prisoner*.[2][6]

From 1967 to 1979, Henderson recorded primarily for Milestone Records, occasionally recording for Verve and other labels.[1] After a brief association with Blood, Sweat & Tears in 1971, he moved to San Francisco to be near his label and taught at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music from 1978 to 1982.[2] In the 1980s, he focused increasingly on reinterpreting standards and his own earlier compositions, establishing a signature repertoire that included Thelonious Monk's "Ask Me Now" as a ballad feature.[2] Henderson's career spanned more than four decades, and his flawless technique, lyricism, unique tone, and compositional skills made him a jazz legend.[4] He died on June 30, 2001.[2]
