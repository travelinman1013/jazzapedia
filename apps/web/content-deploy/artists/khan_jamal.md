## Biography
Khan Jamal, born Warren Robert Cheeseboro on July 23, 1946, in Jacksonville, Florida, grew up in Philadelphia where he began playing vibraphone in his late teens. He received formal training at the Granoff School of Music and Combs College of Music, both prestigious institutions attended by jazz legends like Dizzy Gillespie and John Coltrane, and studied privately with vibraphonist Bill Lewis. In the late 1960s, he adopted the name Khan Jamal, reflecting his alignment with Black Arts and Black Consciousness movements, and started performing with groups like the Sun Ra Arkestra and Cosmic Forces, before joining Sunny Murray's Untouchable Factor and briefly moving to New York.[1][2][3]

Jamal's career flourished in Philadelphia from the early 1970s, where he founded the cooperative septet Sounds of Liberation in 1970 with Byard Lancaster, Monnette Sudler, and others, releasing the influential album *New Horizons* (also known as *Sounds of Liberation*) in 1972. As a prolific bandleader, he recorded 16 albums under his own name, including his debut *Drum Dance to the Motherland* (1973) and *Infinity* (1984), blending free jazz, jazz-fusion, post-bop, and African traditions—incorporating instruments like the balafon—while maintaining a melodic approach amid avant-garde experimentation. He collaborated widely as a sideman with artists like Archie Shepp, Grachan Moncur III, and Ronald Shannon Jackson's Decoding Society in the 1980s.[1][2][3][4]

Despite health issues like heart problems after 2009 limiting his performances, Jamal's legacy endures through recent reissues of his rare albums, cementing his status as a pivotal figure in Philadelphia's avant-garde jazz scene. He passed away on January 10, 2022, in Philadelphia due to kidney failure at age 75, leaving two sons, Khan II and Tahir.[1][2][3]
