## Biography
The Red Hot Brass Band is a traditional New Orleans brass band formed in 2006, emerging from the city's rich brass band tradition. Composed of young musicians trained through programs like the Music Friends of the Arts (MFAA) and The New Orleans Traditional Jazz Camp, the band embodies the second-line parade style central to New Orleans culture, blending marching rhythms with communal celebration[4][6].

Under the mentorship of established groups such as the Storyville Stompers and the Treme Brass Band, Red Hot Brass Band developed its sound by preserving classic brass elements—trumpets, trombones, tuba, and snare/bass drums—while performing at local events, parades, and venues in New Orleans[4][6]. Their career focuses on live performances that sustain the tradition amid a landscape dominated by more modernized brass acts like Rebirth Brass Band.

The band's legacy lies in its role as a bridge for younger players into traditional brass band music, contributing to the ongoing vitality of New Orleans' street music scene without venturing into extensive recordings or national tours, as indicated by their low Spotify popularity[4][6].
