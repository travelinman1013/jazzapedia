## Biography
Alvin Youngblood Hart is one of the world's foremost practitioners of country blues, born in Oakland, California in 1963 to a family of post-World War II Mississippi transplants.[5] He spent formative years in Carroll County, Mississippi, where he was deeply influenced by the Mississippi country blues performed by his relatives.[1] Hart began playing guitar in earnest in 1977 at age 15, describing it as an obsessive competition among teenage boys of his era.[5] After two decades of development as a musician, he emerged as a respected figure in blues music, known for his ability to blend traditional acoustic blues with electric guitar rock, western swing, and traditional country influences.[1][2]

Hart's professional career began with his debut album *Big Mama's Door* released in 1996 on Okeh Records, which received critical acclaim for its blend of technique and feeling.[6] His breakthrough came when he opened for blues legend Taj Mahal at Yoshi's, leading to a mentorship that became pivotal to his career development.[1] In 2003, his album *Down in the Alley* was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Traditional Blues Album, and in 2005 he received a Grammy Award for his contribution to the compilation album *Beautiful Dreamer: The Songs of Stephen Foster*.[1][2] Hart has been praised by musical legends including Bob Dylan and Eric Clapton, and his style has been compared to Lead Belly and Spade Cooley.[1][4]

Beyond his solo work, Hart has collaborated with various artists and formed The South Memphis String Band in 2010 with Jimbo Mathus and Luther Dickinson, whose debut album *Home Sweet Home* was nominated for Best Acoustic Album at the 2011 Blues Foundation Music Awards.[2] He is also a multi-instrumentalist proficient on acoustic and electric guitars, banjo, and mandolin, and served seven years in active duty with the U.S. Coast Guard, where he developed electronics repair skills that earned him nicknames like 'The Garage Guerrilla' and 'The Rock N Roll MacGyver' among fellow musicians.[5] Hart continues to perform at legendary venues worldwide and remains committed to bringing country blues traditions to younger generations.

## Fun Facts
- Hart is an accomplished guitar technician and self-described 'guitar tinker' since childhood—when his parents bought him a new guitar, he had every screw removed by bedtime. This passion led to a seven-year career in the U.S. Coast Guard as an electronics technician, skills he now uses for quick repairs on the road.[5]
- Hart served as a guitar tutor to actor Samuel L. Jackson for his role in the 2006 film Black Snake Moan, and recorded a duet with co-star Christina Ricci titled 'This Little Light Of Mine' that was ultimately left on the cutting room floor.[6]
- Hart received the W.C. Handy Award for Best New Artist in 1997 at age 34, making him a relatively late bloomer in the music industry despite decades of musical development.[1]
- Hart has performed at legendary venues including the Hollywood Bowl and Royal Albert Hall, and has shared the stage with the Allman Brothers Band and members of Thin Lizzy, achievements he describes as surpassing his teenage dreams.[5]
