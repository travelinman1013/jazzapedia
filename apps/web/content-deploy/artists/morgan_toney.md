## Biography
Morgan Toney is a Mi'kmaq folk singer-songwriter and fiddler born in We'koqma'q First Nation on Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, Canada. Growing up in a home where the Mi'kmaw language was not spoken due to the impacts of the residential school system, Toney's early musical spark came from watching a DVD of Phil Collins at his uncle's house, which inspired him to start playing drums. As a teenager, he moved to Wagmatcook First Nation, where immersion in Mi'kmaq culture at school—featuring smudging ceremonies, prayers in Mi'kmaq, and the Mi’kmaq Honour Song—ignited his cultural reconnection. There, he transitioned from drumset to First Nations drumming, learning traditional songs directly from elders in talking circles, a form of Mi'kmaq governance.[1][2][3][4][5]

Toney began learning fiddle in the late 2010s, blending it with Mi'kmaq traditions to create his signature 'Mi’kmaltic' style, fusing fiery Cape Breton Celtic fiddling with ancestral Mi’kmaw songs. His career gained momentum after meeting singer-songwriter Keith Mullins, with whom he planned an album disrupted by COVID-19; he debuted at the virtual Celtic Colours festival in 2020 alongside Ashley MacIsaac. His debut album, *First Flight* (Ishkōdé Records, 2022), won an East Coast Music Award and was nominated for Canadian Folk Music Awards, featuring reimagined traditional songs like *Ko’jua* and the Mi’kmaq Honour Song alongside original works addressing contemporary issues like racism faced by First Nations. His follow-up, *Resilience* (2023), earned a 2024 JUNO nomination, establishing him as a key figure bridging cultures.[1][2][3][4][5][7]

Toney's music honors elders' teachings, celebrates Mi'kmaq language and heritage, and unites diverse audiences, earning awards like Indigenous Artist of the Year at the East Coast Music Awards and Music Nova Scotia. Active since 2018, he performs as a vital voice in Atlantic Canada's Indigenous and folk scenes, transforming personal reconnection into a broader cultural legacy.[2][5]
