## Biography
Eric Lindell was born in 1969 in San Mateo, California, and spent his formative years in the San Francisco Bay Area, particularly in Santa Rosa and Forestville. During his youth, he immersed himself in diverse musical traditions, from the deep blues of artists like Buddy Guy, Junior Wells, and Jimmy Reed to the soul and R&B sounds of The Impressions, Stevie Wonder, and Donny Hathaway. While working as a baker during the day, Lindell honed his craft as a vocalist and multi-instrumentalist (guitar, bass, and harmonica) by performing in bars throughout Sonoma County. He released his debut album, "Bring It Back," in 1996 and gained a devoted Northern California following through countless performances and late-night jam sessions, attracting established musicians like Charlie Musselwhite and Tom Waits to his shows.

In 1999, seeking new musical horizons, Lindell relocated to New Orleans, Louisiana, where he became deeply integrated into the city's vibrant music scene. He performed regularly in dive bars and quickly caught the attention of prominent local artists, including Branford Marsalis and The Neville Brothers. His collaboration with keyboardist Ivan Neville and drummer Stanton Moore from the band Galactic proved particularly influential in shaping his sound. Lindell's breakthrough came in 2006 when Alligator Records released "Change in the Weather," a compilation of his self-produced work that yielded the radio single "Give It Time" and earned widespread critical acclaim from publications including Guitar Player, The New Yorker, and Down Beat. His subsequent albums "Gulf Coast Highway" (2009) and "Low On Cash, Rich In Love" (2009) solidified his national reputation, with appearances on Late Night with Conan O'Brien and NPR's Mountain Stage, while his songs were featured in television shows including Boston Legal and Treme.

Lindell's distinctive musical style blends West Coast rock, swampy Gulf Coast R&B, honky tonk country, and Memphis soul into a cohesive American roots music sound often categorized as "blue-eyed soul." His raspy, soulful voice combined with instantly memorable original compositions and laid-back grooves have earned him critical recognition and a devoted international fanbase. Though he has maintained a lower mainstream profile in recent years, Lindell continues to be recognized as a prolific and authentic roots musician whose live performances are characterized by enthusiastic audiences singing along to every song.
