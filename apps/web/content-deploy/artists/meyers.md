## Biography
Ty Wenston Myers, born July 12, 2007, just outside Austin, Texas, grew up on his family's cattle ranch, owned for over six generations. Introduced to music by his father, a local singer-songwriter, Myers began playing guitar at age seven and writing songs by age eight. He balanced music with sports like football and baseball until a knee injury in his sophomore year of high school shifted his focus entirely to music, leading his mother to create a TikTok profile for him.[1][3][5]

Myers's career exploded in 2023 with independent releases of 'Tie That Binds,' 'Drinkin' Alone,' 'But Me,' and 'Tomorrow's Out Of Sight,' which went viral on TikTok, amassing millions of streams. This success earned him a deal with Starstruck Management, RECORDS Nashville, and Columbia Records. His debut album, *The Select*, arrived digitally on January 24, 2025, followed by physical editions and a deluxe version. The lead single 'Ends of the Earth' charted Top 20 on Hot Country Songs and Country Airplay, reaching the Billboard Hot 100, while earning RIAA certifications including Platinum.[1][2][3][5]

Myers blends classic country storytelling with bluesy riffs and soulful vocals, drawing from influences like George Strait, Otis Redding, Stevie Ray Vaughan, John Mayer, Muddy Waters, and Jimi Hendrix. He has headlined the Let 'Em Talk Tour (2024) and The Select Tour (2025), supported Luke Combs in 2026, and opened for artists including Willie Nelson, Randy Rogers Band, Wade Bowen, Cody Johnson, Old Dominion, and Tim McGraw. At 18, he is recognized as Billboard Country Rookie of the Month and featured in 21 Under 21 lists.[1][2][3][5]
