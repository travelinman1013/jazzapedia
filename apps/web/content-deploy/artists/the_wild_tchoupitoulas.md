## Biography
The Wild Tchoupitoulas were a Mardi Gras Indian tribe formed in the early 1970s in New Orleans, Louisiana, by George 'Big Chief Jolly' Landry, who claimed Choctaw heritage and had been active in Mardi Gras Indian traditions for years. Named after the Tchoupitoulas tribe and the famous Tchoupitoulas Street, the group embodied the cultural fusion of African American and Native American influences, evolving from street parades into a musical act blending call-and-response chants with funk and R&B. Landry, previously masking with Bo Dollis' Wild Magnolias, was inspired by their success to record with his own tribe.[1][2][3][5]

In 1976, with production by Allen Toussaint, the group released their self-titled debut album, backed by New Orleans funk legends The Meters (Leo Nocentelli on guitar, George Porter Jr. on bass, Zigaboo Modeliste on drums) and featuring vocals and instrumentation from Landry's nephews—the Neville Brothers (Art, Aaron, Charles, and Cyril Neville). The album transformed traditional tambourine-and-percussion street music into electric funk infused with reggae and calypso elements, showcasing Landry's improvisational chants alongside tribe members like Norman Bell (Second Chief) and Amos Landry (Spy Boy).[3][5][6][7]

Though not a commercial hit, the critically acclaimed album bridged genres and generations, earning induction into the Library of Congress National Recording Registry for its cultural significance. It inspired the Neville Brothers to form their own band, cementing The Wild Tchoupitoulas' legacy in preserving and popularizing Mardi Gras Indian music.[3][5][7]

## Fun Facts
- The group's name derives from a fabled lost Indigenous tribe meaning 'those who live at the river,' also referencing Tchoupitoulas Street in New Orleans.[7]
- The album repurposed the instrumental from the calypso hit 'Rum and Coca-Cola' (originally by Lord Invader) for the traditional chant 'Meet De Boys On The Battlefront'.[7]
- Founded during a late night in 1974 at the Patio Bar with friends, the tribe still holds open practices in bars from October to February leading up to Mardi Gras.[5]
- The Neville Brothers brought extensive experience: Art Neville from 'Mardi Gras Mambo' (1955) and The Meters; Aaron from 'Tell It Like It Is' (1967).[5]
