## Biography
Justine Washington, professionally known as Baby Washington (sometimes credited as Jeanette (Baby) Washington), was born on November 13, 1940, in Bamberg, South Carolina, and raised in Harlem, New York, where she studied piano as a child and developed an early passion for show business. She launched her career in 1956 as a teenager with the vocal group the Hearts, known for their R&B hit 'Lonely Nights,' earning her the nickname 'Baby' as the youngest member; she also recorded with the Jaynetts on 'I Wanted To Be Free.' Transitioning to a solo artist in 1957 with 'Everyday' on J&S Records, she signed with Neptune Records in 1958, establishing her soul style with hits like 'The Time' (R&B #22, 1959), 'The Bells' (R&B #20, 1959), and 'Nobody Cares' (R&B #17, 1961).[1][2][3][4]

Washington's career peaked in the 1960s across labels including ABC Paramount (1961, with the self-written 'Let Love Go By' later a Northern soul favorite) and Sue Records (1962), where she scored her biggest hit, 'That's How Heartaches Are Made' (Billboard Hot 100 Top 40, 1963), and 'Only Those In Love' (R&B Top 10, 1965), amassing 16 Billboard R&B chart entries over 15 years in uptown soul, characterized by her earthy yet sophisticated voice. She revived her career in the early 1970s with a duet cover of the Marvelettes' 'Forever' with Don Gardner (R&B #30) and 'I've Got To Break Away' (R&B #73), though disco's rise diminished her popularity; she remained active in live performances into the 2010s, including festivals and cruise ships.[1][2][3][4]

Despite lacking major crossover success compared to southern soul peers, Washington's legacy endures in northern soul and doo-wop circles, with over 60 singles released from 1956 to 1978 and continued appreciation for her emotive delivery.
