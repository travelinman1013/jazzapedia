## Biography
Dash Rip Rock is an American rock band formed in the summer of 1984 in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, by guitarist, songwriter, and vocalist Bill Davis while he was attending Louisiana State University. Initially assembled as a side project to earn extra money, the band quickly gained traction with its high-energy performances blending punk rock, rockabilly, hard rock, country, and boogie into a pioneering cowpunk sound. Original members included bassist Ned 'Hoaky' Hickel and drummer F. Clarke Martty, all veterans of the post-punk scene, who started with revved-up country and rockabilly, donning cowboy shirts and bolo ties. The band relocated to New Orleans, released their self-titled debut album in 1986 on 688 Records, and signed with Mammoth Records for subsequent releases like Ace of Clubs (1989) and Not of This World (1990), touring with acts like The Cramps and The Reverend Horton Heat.[1][2][3][4]

Dash Rip Rock's career exploded in the 1990s with the tongue-in-cheek hit 'Let's Go Smoke Some Pot,' a parody that became a radio staple and live show favorite, covered by major acts. Over four decades, they have released 17 albums, hailed as underground classics, on labels including Alternative Tentacles (Jello Biafra's imprint) and Drag Snake Records. Bill Davis, the founder and frontman, is celebrated for his blistering guitar and songwriting, earning praise from Spin as 'the South’s greatest rock band.' Recent works include Cowpunk (2023, produced by Dave Catching) and the upcoming A Song in Everyone (2026, with Bobby Matt Patton of Drive-By Truckers), alongside the single 'Pain Pills Never Expire' exclusive on SiriusXM Outlaw Country. Inducted into the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame in 2012, the band—currently Bill Davis, Wade Hymel, and Izzy Grisoli—remains a festival mainstay with irreverent, roots-based energy.[1][2][3][5]

Their legacy as cowpunk pioneers has built a diverse fanbase spanning rock, Americana, rockabilly, country, and punk, with consistent touring and a reputation for tight musicianship and raw, whimsical songs of insolence and longing. Despite lineup changes, Dash Rip Rock endures as Louisiana swamp-punk legends, influencing alt-country and maintaining high-octane live shows.[1][2][6]
