## Biography
Dewey Balfa, D.L. Menard, and Marc Savoy are three renowned Cajun musicians from southwest Louisiana, celebrated for their roles in preserving and popularizing traditional Cajun music. Dewey Balfa, a fiddler and vocalist, led the Balfa Brothers band, which gained prominence after performing at the 1964 Newport Folk Festival at the invitation of Ralph Rinzler, leading to tours across the United States, Canada, and France in 1975. D.L. Menard, born April 14, 1932, in Erath, Louisiana, began as a guitarist in cotton fields, formed the Louisiana Aces, and composed enduring songs like 'La Porte d’en Arrière,' blending Cajun with country elements; he received the 1994 National Heritage Fellowship and other honors. Marc Savoy, born October 1, 1940, near Eunice, Louisiana, on his grandfather's rice farm, started playing accordion at age 12, influenced by his fiddler grandfather and Dennis McGee, later earning a chemical engineering degree before founding Savoy Music Center in 1966 to build and play Cajun accordions.[1][2][3][4]

Their careers intertwined through folk festival circuits in the mid-1960s and a pivotal 1976 tour together in Delaware, North Carolina, and Washington, D.C., culminating in their debut trio album 'Under a Green Oak Tree' (also known as 'En Bas du Chene Vert') on Arhoolie Records, featuring classics like 'Chameaux One-Step' and 'J'ai Fait Un Gros Erreur.' Savoy performed extensively with Balfa, Menard, and others like Rodney Balfa and Michael Doucet in the Savoy-Doucet Band, while also hosting jam sessions at his Music Center and playing in the family band with wife Ann Savoy and sons Joel and Wilson. Menard balanced music with chair-making, and Balfa continued promoting Cajun heritage despite personal tragedies, including the deaths of his wife and brothers.[1][4][6][7]

Collectively, they embodied Cajun music's revival, with Savoy's accordion craftsmanship, Menard's songwriting, and Balfa's fiddling ensuring the genre's legacy through recordings, festivals, and cultural advocacy, influencing global appreciation of Acadian traditions.[1][2][4]
