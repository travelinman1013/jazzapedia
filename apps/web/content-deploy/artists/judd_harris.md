## Biography
Judd Harris, often referred to as Judson Harris, was born and raised in the small town of Okeechobee, South Florida, in a musical family where siblings and a parent were involved in music. His passion for worship music began early; at age 13, he started practicing guitar at his church and was reluctantly thrust into leading the youth praise band by age 15 as a high school freshman, falling in love with the genre influenced by Hillsong United. He attended Liberty University, initially failing an audition for the Worship Collective (then the Department of Ministry Teams) in fall 2013 but persisting to join later that year, spending the next six years traveling with the team (first as 71dB) during his undergrad.[1][2]

In 2017, Harris interned at Harvest Bible Chapel in Chicago, where he joined Vertical Worship—a band formed in 2012—after a transformative experience that reshaped his understanding of worship leading. He served as lead vocalist on their hit 'Yes I Will,' nominated for a Dove Award with over 25 million Spotify streams, and contributed to albums like Bright Faith Bold Future. Balancing his career, he pursued a master's degree at Liberty, later becoming Artist in Residence and full-time staff with the Liberty Worship Collective, coaching and mentoring student worship leaders while continuing with Vertical Worship, emphasizing gospel-centered music for the local church.[1][2][3]

Harris's musical style is rooted in contemporary Christian worship, prioritizing storytelling about God's mysteries and relevance, with a powerful voice often humorously likened to 'Liberty’s Thor' for his long blonde hair and beard. His legacy includes global ministry through Vertical Worship's tours (e.g., Canada, Mexico), digital impact, and nurturing the next generation of worship leaders at Liberty, viewing his bandmates as family amid the rigors of travel.[1][2]
