# Ambrosia

## Biography
Ambrosia is an American rock band formed in 1970 in the South Bay area of Los Angeles, California, by guitarist/vocalist David Pack and bassist/vocalist Joe Puerta, recent high school graduates inspired by progressive rock acts like King Crimson after attending their debut show at the Whisky a Go Go. They recruited drummer Burleigh Drummond from a musicians' directory and keyboardist Christopher North, known for his dramatic stage entrances, forming the original quartet named after the Greek mythological 'nectar of the gods.' Signing with 20th Century Fox Records in 1975 through producer Freddie Piro, their self-titled debut album featured the top 20 hit 'Holdin' On to Yesterday' and earned a Grammy nomination for Best Engineered Recording, blending progressive rock with lush harmonies.[1][2][5]

The band's career evolved with their 1976 album 'Somewhere I've Never Traveled,' produced by Alan Parsons, which received critical acclaim and FM radio success, followed by a move to Warner Bros. Records in 1977 after industry executives Mo Ostin and Ted Templeman acquired their catalog. Their 1978 Warner debut 'Life Beyond L.A.' included the #1 adult contemporary hit 'How Much I Feel,' written and sung by Pack, shifting toward pop ballads while retaining prog elements. Keyboardist North departed due to personal issues, leaving a core trio; their final original album, 1982's 'Road Island,' was co-produced by James Guthrie (Pink Floyd's 'The Wall') and featured guest Bruce Hornsby on keyboards for the tour. Internal disputes led to a breakup, though they reformed periodically, with Pack leading efforts into the 1990s and beyond amid legal battles over the band name.[1][4]

Ambrosia's style fused progressive rock's complexity with yacht rock/soft rock accessibility, earning tours with acts like Fleetwood Mac, Heart, Doobie Brothers, Kansas, and Rush, and collaborations with icons like Leonard Bernstein and Kurt Vonnegut. Their legacy endures through classic hits, live performances with updated lineups including Kipp Lennon and Mary Harris, and influence on melodic rock, maintaining a career spanning over five decades.[3][4][5]

## Fun Facts
- The band name Ambrosia comes from Greek mythology meaning 'nectar of the gods'; early name was 'Ambergris Mite'.[1][2]
- 'Holdin’ On to Yesterday' reached #1 in Denver before any other U.S. city, giving them a special affinity for the Mile High City.[5]
- Keyboardist Christopher North was notorious for arriving at shows in a coffin and 'bloodying' his Hammond B3 organ.[1]
- They recorded 'Magical Mystery Tour' with the London Philharmonic for the 1976 film 'All This and World War II'.[1]
