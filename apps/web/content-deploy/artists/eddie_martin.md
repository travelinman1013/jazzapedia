## Biography
Eddie Martin, born in London and raised in Watford, began his musical journey in his early teens, influenced by folk records from his mother like Burl Ives, classic rock, and singer-songwriters such as Bob Dylan. At age 15, he acquired his first guitar and started writing and performing original songs, initially blending hard rock with folk styles in a band and solo settings. His passion for blues ignited around age 16 upon discovering Freddie King and Robert Johnson, leading him to immerse himself in the Afro-American music heritage, which became the foundation of his career as a singer-songwriter, guitarist, and harmonica player.[1][2][3][4]
