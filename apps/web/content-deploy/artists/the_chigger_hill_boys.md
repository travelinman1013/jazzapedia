## Biography
The Chigger Hill Boys & Terri, a gospel bluegrass group, formed in late summer 2001 in the Hendersonville, Tennessee area. Founding members Mike Richards, the original mandolin player, and Terri Argot Gore, who began writing songs together, were inspired by Richards' suggestion to create a bluegrass band, highlighting Gore's direct Appalachian vocal style as a key element.[1][2] The group has since released nine studio albums, including their latest, *Every Good Path*, featuring original songs primarily written or co-written by Gore, blending bluegrass instrumentation with southern gospel themes of faith, grace, and redemption.[3][4][7]

Their musical style fuses **christian bluegrass**, **southern gospel**, **country christian**, and traditional **bluegrass**, characterized by joyful instrumentation like hammering banjo, mandolin, fiddle, resophonic guitar, and upright bass, paired with Gore's unadorned lead vocals and harmonious backing.[2][3] Tracks like *My Path Was Paved By The Blood Of The Lamb*, *Nothing Quite As Amazing As Grace*, and *Every Good Path* exemplify their originality in delivering profound Christian messages through catchy melodies and rhythmic grooves.[3][4] Active for over two decades, they continue touring churches across the U.S., performing at events with love offerings, maintaining a dedicated following in bluegrass and gospel circles despite being somewhat overlooked by mainstream communities.[4][6]

The group's legacy lies in their consistent output of faith-centered music that bridges bluegrass and gospel traditions, with recent releases on Morning Glory Music produced by the band and Greg Cole, featuring guest musicians to enhance their sound.[3][4] They emphasize exalting Jesus Christ through toe-tapping gospel bluegrass, supported by fans, family, and a 2025 tour schedule spanning Kentucky, Tennessee, Michigan, and more.[4]
