## Biography
Jerry Jones is a Jamaican rocksteady and soul singer known for his contributions to the Studio One label during the late 1960s transition from rocksteady to early reggae. Active in the vibrant Jamaican music scene under producer Clement 'Coxsone' Dodd, Jones recorded tracks that captured the soul-influenced sound of the era, characterized by slowed-down rhythms and close vocal harmonies inspired by American soul acts like Curtis Mayfield and The Impressions. His work exemplifies the fertile environment at Studio One, where artists blended R&B roots with emerging reggae elements amid Jamaica's social and political changes.
