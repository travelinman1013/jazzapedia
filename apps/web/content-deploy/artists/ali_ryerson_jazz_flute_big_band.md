## Biography
Ali Ryerson, born on October 21, 1952, in New York City, grew up in a musical family with her father, Art Ryerson, a renowned jazz guitarist who performed with the Paul Whiteman Orchestra and recorded with legends like Louis Armstrong, Charlie Parker, and Frank Sinatra. Initially envisioning a dual career in jazz and classical music, she studied flute with Harold Bennett of the NY Metropolitan Orchestra, John Wion of the NYC Opera Orchestra, and performed at Julius Baker masterclasses, graduating from the Hartt School of Music. Her focus shifted to jazz at age 20 with a touring show-band gig alongside jazz musicians, leading to her first European tour and recording in the mid-1980s.[1][2][3]

Ryerson's career spans over four decades as an international touring and recording jazz flutist, consistently ranking among top flutists in the DownBeat Jazz Poll. She has released nearly two dozen albums on labels like Concord, DMP, Capri, and Red Baron, with her Jazz Flute Big Band's debut 'Game Changer' (2013) hitting the US Jazz Charts' Top 10 for six weeks. A pioneer in jazz flute, she founded the NFA Jazz Flute Big Band in 2005 as Jazz Chair, served as musical director of the Hudson River Regional Jazz Festival (2001-2004), and composes for flute ensembles, premiering works at NFA conventions since 2013. She has performed at Carnegie Hall, Blue Note, and global festivals.[1][2][3][4]

Her legacy includes authoring the 'Jazz Flute Practice Method,' offering masterclasses worldwide, and endorsing Gemeinhardt flutes with her autograph series. Ryerson's innovative Jazz Flute Big Band, featuring flutes from piccolo to contrabass with a rhythm section and commissioned arrangements, has elevated jazz flute, creating opportunities for aspiring players within the flute community.[1][2][4]
