## Biography
Keith Frank, born on October 9, 1972, in the community of Soileau, Louisiana, between Oberlin and Elton, grew up immersed in zydeco music as the son of musician Preston Frank. Starting at age four, he played drums in his father's Preston Frank Swallow Band, switching to accordion by six and taking over full-time drumming by nine. Initially resentful of zydeco—once stating he 'hated it' and preferred other activities—Frank's perspective shifted as his father's job at a plywood plant limited his availability, leading Frank to embrace the genre as an integral part of his life.[1]

In 1990, while at Oberlin High School, Frank formed Keith Frank and the Soileau Zydeco Band with his sister Jennifer on bass and brother Brad on drums. Their debut cassette *On the Bandstand* (1992) was followed by *Get on Boy!* (1993) on Hound Records, where his hands-on production earned him the nickname 'Zydeco Boss.' Frank pioneered nouveau zydeco, blending traditional sounds with R&B and hip-hop influences like double-kicking bass drums, inspired by Zydeco Force and Boozoo Chavis. By the late 1990s, he dominated Southwest Louisiana and East Texas scenes, becoming Maison de Soul's top zydeco seller by 1998, and released projects like *The Masked Band* (2001) under The Creole Connection pseudonym.[1]

Frank's legacy endures as a prolific performer known for grueling schedules—often three shows in one day—and innovations like his 2021 re-recording *The Resurrection of The Creole Connection*. His collaborations, such as 'Haterz' with Lil Boosie, highlight his genre-blending appeal, maintaining zydeco's vitality while broadening its reach through Creole roots and modern fusions.[1][2][3]

## Fun Facts
- Initially hated zydeco so much as a child that he said, 'I hated it. I swear, I hated it,' but grew to embrace it when his father's work schedule forced more responsibility on him.[1]
- Had a mid-1990s feud with Beau Jocque over similar songs tracing back to the 1965 R&B track 'I Got Loaded' by Camille Bob, leading to musical disses.[1]
- Released *The Masked Band* (2001) under the pseudonym The Creole Connection, performing in costumes to hide identities, and re-recorded it in 2021 as *The Resurrection of The Creole Connection*.[1]
- Known for extreme work ethic, often performing three shows in three different places in one day.[1]
