## Biography
Lottie Kimbrough (born 1893 or 1900; date of death unknown) was an American country blues singer who became known as "The Kansas City Butterball," a nickname referencing her size.[1] Born in either Jonesboro, Arkansas, or West Bottoms, Kansas City, Missouri, Kimbrough developed close ties to the Kansas City blues community.[1] She began her music career in the early 1920s, performing in nightclubs and speakeasies throughout Kansas City while also touring the black vaudeville circuits with her brother Sylvester.[4] Her recording career, which lasted from 1924 to 1929, established her as a significant figure in the 1920s blues tradition, with music journalist Burgin Mathews noting that "Kimbrough's vocal power, and the unique arrangements of several of her best pieces, rank her as one of the sizable talents of the 1920s blues tradition."[1]

Kimbrough's professional life was characterized by complexity and obscurity. She performed and recorded under numerous names—including Lottie Beaman (her married name), Lottie Mitchell, Clara Cary, Mae Moran, Lena Kimbrough, Lottie Brown, Lottie Emerson, Martha Jackson, and Jennie Brooks—making her historical record difficult to trace.[1][4] Her manager and frequent collaborator Winston Holmes was likely responsible for many of these pseudonyms, which were used across various record labels including Paramount, Merritt, Gennett, Champion, Supertone, and Superior Records.[1][3] Her musical style blended country blues with hillmark elements such as yodeling and banjo playing, distinguishing her from purely traditional blues artists.[2] By the 1930s, her recording career had ended, and very little is known about the remainder of her life.
