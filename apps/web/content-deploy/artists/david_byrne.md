## Biography
David Byrne (born May 14, 1952) is a Scottish-born musician, writer, visual artist, and filmmaker best known as the founding member, principal songwriter, lead singer, and guitarist of the influential new wave band Talking Heads[1][3]. Born in Dumbarton, Dunbartonshire, Scotland, Byrne moved to the United States with his family as a child. He began his musical career in high school bands before attending the Rhode Island School of Design in the mid-1970s, where he met future Talking Heads members Tina Weymouth and Chris Frantz[1][3].

Byrne co-founded Talking Heads in 1975 in New York City, and the band became pioneers of the new wave music scene in the late 1970s and early 1980s[1]. With Byrne as the creative force, Talking Heads released eight studio albums, with four achieving gold status and two certified double-platinum, featuring iconic songs like "Psycho Killer" (1977), "Once in a Lifetime" (1980), "Burning Down the House" (1983), and "Road to Nowhere" (1985)[1][2]. The band was known for their experimental approach, blending punk aesthetics with African rhythms and innovative music videos that gained regular MTV rotation[1]. Talking Heads officially disbanded in December 1991 and were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002[1][2].

Beyond Talking Heads, Byrne established himself as an eclectic solo artist and interdisciplinary creative. He collaborated with producer Brian Eno on the groundbreaking album "My Life in the Bush of Ghosts" (1979-1981), which pioneered early sampling and found sounds[1]. His solo career, which began in earnest in 1989 with "Rei Momo," has included diverse projects spanning world music, gospel, and experimental pop[3]. He founded Luaka Bop Records in 1988 to introduce American audiences to various strains of world music[3]. Byrne's work extends beyond music into visual art, filmmaking, and performance, with his "American Utopia" tour (2018-present) described as blurring the lines "between gig and theatre, poetry and dance"[1].

## Fun Facts
- Byrne originally wanted a Japanese-language section for the bridge of "Psycho Killer," the band's signature debut hit, and found a girl who could speak the language, but she was frightened away when he asked her to participate[4]
- Byrne was initially reluctant to let Tina Weymouth join Talking Heads, believing women's roles shouldn't be in the "big world" because it was dangerous for women; he asked her to audition three times before she officially joined[4]
- Byrne approached stage movement not as a dancer but as an actor, famously gesturing in what appeared to be "Martian sign language" while moving like a malfunctioning robot during performances[4]
- Byrne established Luaka Bop Records in 1988 specifically as a means of introducing American audiences to various strains of world music, reflecting his diverse musical interests[3]
