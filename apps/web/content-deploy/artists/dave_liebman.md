## Biography
David Liebman was born on September 4, 1946, in Brooklyn, New York. He began classical piano lessons at age nine and took up the saxophone by twelve, pursuing jazz interests through high school and college by studying with saxophone instructor Joe Allard, as well as jazz musicians Lennie Tristano and Charles Lloyd. After graduating from New York University with a degree in American History in 1968, he freelanced as a saxophonist while certified as a substitute teacher, gigging in Catskills resorts and Manhattan jazz clubs. His early breakthrough came in 1969 with the jazz-rock band Ten Wheel Drive, followed by an apprenticeship with drummer Pete La Roca and bassist Steve Swallow.[1][2][3]

In the early 1970s, Liebman founded Free Life Communication, a cooperative central to New York's loft jazz scene, and joined Elvin Jones' group as saxophonist/flutist (1970-1972), then Miles Davis' band (1972-1974), contributing to landmark fusion albums like *On the Corner* and *Get Up with It*. Post-Davis, he led the Open Sky Trio with Bob Moses, Lookout Farm with Richie Beirach, a quintet featuring John Scofield, and formed Quest in 1981 with Beirach, Ron McClure, and Billy Hart, which reunited periodically. His style spans free jazz, fusion, postbop, and avant-garde, played primarily on soprano saxophone, with over 500 recordings, 200+ originals, and consistent top rankings in DownBeat polls since 1973.[1][2][3][4][5]

Liebman's legacy as a 'renaissance man' includes NEA Jazz Master status, IAJE Hall of Fame induction (2000), a 1998 Grammy nomination, authorship of influential books like *A Chromatic Approach to Jazz Harmony and Melody*, global teaching at universities and clinics, and ongoing projects like Saxophone Summit with Joe Lovano and Ravi Coltrane, demonstrating insatiable innovation across Puccini arias, world music, and solo overdubs.[1][4][5][6]
