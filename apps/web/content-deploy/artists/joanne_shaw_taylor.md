## Biography
Joanne Shaw Taylor, born in 1985 in the Black Country region of England, specifically near Birmingham in the West Midlands, emerged as a prodigious talent in blues rock from a young age. Her father, a guitar player, influenced her early interest in music, and by 16, she was discovered by Dave Stewart of the Eurythmics while performing, leading to an invitation to tour with his supergroup D.U.P., which launched her professional career.[1][2][5][6][8] Known for her extraordinary guitar skills, soulful voice, and advanced songwriting, Taylor blends blues, blues rock, and modern blues styles, earning praise from industry figures like Jimmy Cliff, Joe Bonamassa, Stevie Wonder, and Annie Lennox.[2][3][4]

Taylor's debut album, *White Sugar* (2009) on Ruf Records, introduced her distinctive sound, peaking at No. 8 on the Billboard Top Blues Albums chart, followed by *Diamonds in the Dirt* (2010), which also charted highly and won her Best Female Vocalist at the British Blues Awards, along with Songwriter of the Year for 'Same as It Never Was' in 2011.[1][3] She released subsequent albums like *Almost Always Never* (2012) with the UK radio hit 'Soul Station,' *The Dirty Truth* (2014), *Wild* (2016) produced by Kevin Shirley, and signed with Sony's Silvertone for *Reckless Heart* (2019), which reached the UK Top 20. Collaborations with Joe Bonamassa and Josh Smith produced *The Blues Album* (2021) and *Nobody's Fool* (2022) on his labels, both debuting at No. 1 on Billboard Blues Charts, alongside live releases like *Blues From The Heart Live* (2022).[1][3][4]

Now in her late 30s, Taylor has solidified her legacy as one of the UK's premier blues rock exports and most sought-after guitarists, with a prolific output including *Heavy Soul* (2024) and *Black & Gold* (2025), marked by electrifying live performances, TV appearances like BBC's Later... with Jools Holland, and consistent chart success.[1][2][4]
