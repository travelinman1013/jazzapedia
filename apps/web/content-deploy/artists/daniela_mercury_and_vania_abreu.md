## Biography
Daniela Mercury (born Daniela Mercuri de Almeida on July 28, 1965, in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil) and her younger sister Vânia Abreu (born Vânia Mercury de Almeida on May 30, 1967) grew up in a middle-class family in the Brotas neighborhood, with parents Liliana Mercuri, a social worker of Italian descent, and António Fernando de Abreu Ferreira de Almeida, a Portuguese-born industrial mechanic. They have three other siblings: Tom, Cristiana, and Marcos. Daniela began dance lessons at age eight and, influenced by Elis Regina at 13, started singing in local bars in 1980, later performing on trio elétricos during Carnival. The sisters performed together in local nightclubs and bars as teenagers to launch their music careers. Daniela studied at the Federal University of Bahia's Dance School in 1984, married Zalther Póvoas in 1985 (with whom she had two children), and fronted bands like Cheiro de Amor (1986-1988) and Companhia Clic (1989), before going solo in 1991.[1][2][3][5]

Daniela's solo career exploded with her 1991 self-titled debut and 1992's *O Canto da Cidade*, which popularized axé music nationwide through hits like 'Swing da Cor' (with Olodum), 'O Canto da Cidade,' and 'Batuque.' Known for blending axé—a mix of Afro-Brazilian samba, rock, pop, reggae, soul, and Caribbean elements—with danceable rhythms, she has sold over 20 million albums worldwide, earned a Latin Grammy for *Balé Mulato – Ao Vivo*, and released hits like 'Rapunzel,' 'Maimbê Dandá' (with Carlinhos Brown), and 'Oyá Por Nós' (with Margareth Menezes). Vânia Abreu pursued a parallel path as a singer and performer in Brazilian popular music (MPB) and Latin pop, though less documented, gaining recognition in Bahia and Latin markets.[1][2][3][4]

As sisters and early collaborators, they represent Bahia's vibrant music scene, with Daniela as axé's superstar and Vânia as a complementary talent. Daniela's legacy includes mainstreaming axé, multiple awards, and cultural advocacy, while their shared roots underscore family influence in Salvador's black cultural hub.[2][4][9]
