## Biography
Mauro Mateus dos Santos, known as Sabotage, was born on April 3, 1973, in the Favela do Canão in São Paulo's southern zone, Brazil. Growing up in a violent environment, he began working as a lookout in drug trafficking at age 8, lost his mother and siblings young, and only completed fifth grade. He sold drugs in neighborhoods like Brooklin Novo and terrorized Vila da Paz, but transformed his life through music, carrying a notebook for compositions and enrolling in a rap course between 1988 and 1989.[2][3][5]

Sabotage gained prominence after being embraced by RZO Group rappers Rapin Hood and Sandrão, who invited him to perform at their concerts. His debut album *Rap é Compromisso!* (2001) exploded in popularity, addressing periphery social realities, police violence, and favela life with wise, authentic lyrics that elevated Brazilian hip-hop from niche to mainstream. He collaborated with Sepultura on their 2002 *Revolusongs* EP, acted as himself in *O Invasor* (2002) contributing to its soundtrack, and portrayed Fuinha in *Carandiru* (2003). A posthumous self-titled album released in 2016 became a Spotify Global Viral hit, with AI-generated lyrics later recorded by RZO.[1][2][5]

Tragically shot four times in the head and chest on January 24, 2003, in São Paulo's Saúde neighborhood at age 29, Sabotage's unsolved murder (later linked to drug disputes, with suspect Sirlei Menezes da Silva arrested in 2010) cemented his mythic status. His unique style, blending raw experience with poetic wisdom, popularized Brazilian rap on TV, radio, and press, influencing superstars like Criolo, Emicida, and Karol Conka, and earning comparisons to 2Pac as Brazil's greatest rapper.[1][2][4]
