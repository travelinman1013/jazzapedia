## Biography
R.S. Rankin, born on February 22, 1933, in Royse City, Texas, USA, is a blues guitarist whose early career was profoundly shaped by his uncle, the legendary T-Bone Walker. Walker not only encouraged the young Rankin to pursue blues guitar but also took him on the road, providing hands-on mentorship and exposure to professional performance[3][4][5]. This familial connection immersed Rankin in the Texas blues tradition from a young age, fostering his development as a musician in the post-World War II blues scene.

Details on Rankin's broader career trajectory, such as specific albums, major releases, or later achievements, remain scarce in available sources, suggesting he may be an underdocumented figure in blues history. His musical style is rooted in blues guitar, influenced directly by T-Bone Walker's electrified sound, though no discography or touring highlights are detailed beyond his early road experiences[3][4][5]. With low streaming presence (14 monthly listeners on Spotify) and popularity of 51, Rankin appears to have maintained a niche or regional profile[5].

Rankin's legacy is tied primarily to his uncle's influence, positioning him as a link in Texas blues lineage, though limited documentation prevents a fuller assessment of his impact or enduring contributions.
