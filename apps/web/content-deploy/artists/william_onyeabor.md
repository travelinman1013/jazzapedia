## Biography
William Onyeabor, born in the mid-1940s to a low-income family in Enugu, southeastern Nigeria, rose from humble beginnings to become a pioneering figure in Nigerian electro Afro-funk. He traveled to Russia in his youth to pursue higher education, studying either record engineering or cinematography, before returning to Nigeria in the late 1970s. There, he established his own record label, Wilfilms, and a recording studio in Enugu, where he produced nine innovative albums between 1977 and 1985, blending Nigerian folk music with American R&B, disco, funk, and advanced synthesizers, drum machines, and DIY recording technology—rare instruments in Nigeria at the time.[1][2][3]

## Fun Facts
- Onyeabor was so reclusive that researchers Eric Welles-Nyström and Uchenna Ikonne were turned away when visiting his hometown in Enugu.
- He imported rare Moog synthesizers to Nigeria and built his own recording studio, earning a reputation as a DIY evangelist and possible 'synth cowboy'.
- After retiring from music in the mid-1980s following a Christian conversion, he became a successful businessman running a flour mill and was named West African Industrialist of the Year in 1987; friends claimed he secretly recorded gospel music as a private pastor.
- Two of his nine albums mysteriously disappeared after his retirement, adding to the enigma of his legacy.
