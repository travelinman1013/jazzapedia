## Biography
Doreen Shaffer, born Monica Johnson in Jamaica, is one of the most influential female voices in Jamaican music history.[1][2] She recorded her first single, "Adorable You," in 1964 on the Studio One label, marking the beginning of a remarkable career spanning over six decades.[1] Between 1964 and 1965, she released songs with The Skatalites, and since 1994 has served as the lead singer of the band, becoming the only surviving original member.[1][3] Her musical journey encompasses ska, rocksteady, reggae, and lovers rock, establishing her as a foundational figure in Jamaica's musical evolution.

Shaffer's solo career produced numerous albums beginning with "The First Lady Of Reggae" in 1970, followed by works including "Wonderful Sounds" (1986), "Adorable" (1997), and "Groovin'" (2009).[1] Her contributions to The Skatalites' discography are equally substantial, with the band releasing over a dozen albums since her official role as lead singer began, including "Hi-Bop Ska" (1994), "Ball Of Fire" (1997), and "Walk With Me" (2012).[1] Rightfully dubbed the "Queen of Ska," Shaffer's vocal prowess and artistic integrity have made her one of Jamaica's finest and most respected singers.[2][3]
