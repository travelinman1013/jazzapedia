## Biography
Bill Laurance, born on 2 April 1981 in North London, England, began his musical journey early, learning piano and playing organ at age 9 during a school trip to Union Chapel, where he later recorded his 2016 live album. Raised in a jazz-influenced home, he attended William Tyndale primary school before studying classical composition at the University of Leeds, where he explored jazz, funk, drum'n'bass, and electronica, forging a distinctive style blending English classical, jazz-rock, and contemporary grooves.[2][3] In his early twenties on the Leeds scene, a pickup gig with Michael League led to his invitation to join Snarky Puppy, recording their debut album The Only Constant in 2006, marking the start of his rise with the three-time (later five-time) Grammy-winning jazz fusion band.[1][2][3]

Laurance launched his solo career in 2014 with Flint, followed by Swift (2015), Aftersun (2016), Live at Union Chapel (2016), and Cables (2019), showcasing mesmerizing modal jams, drum and bass rhythms, world music grooves, and cinematic sweeps that build from minimalism to rhapsodic crescendos.[1][2] His genre-defying sound earned him Jazz FM's Breakthrough Act of the Year in 2015, while Snarky Puppy contributions netted Grammys for Sylva (2016) and Culcha Vulcha (2017).[2] A key collaboration came in 2018 with Germany's WDR Big Band, led by Bob Mintzer, reimagining his compositions live at Kölner Philharmonie for a 2019 album, expanding his orchestral vision akin to Snarky Puppy's Metropole Orkest work.[1][2]

As founder and CEO of Flint Music label, Laurance continues innovating, composing for dancers like Alvin Ailey's Hope Boykin, UK companies such as Matthew Bourne’s Adventures in Motion Pictures, and orchestras worldwide, while performing with his trio, duo with League, and diverse artists, captivating new jazz generations with renewed relevance.[3][5][6]
