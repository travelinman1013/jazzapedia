## Biography
Chico O'Farrill, born Arturo O'Farrill on October 28, 1921, in Havana, Cuba, to an aristocratic family with Irish and Cuban heritage, began his musical career as a trumpeter in local bands like Orquesta Bellemar by 1945 before moving to New York in 1948. There, he worked as a ghost arranger for Gil Fuller and composed for Benny Goodman, including 'Undercurrent Blues,' gaining recognition in Latin jazz circles. He pioneered Afro-Cuban jazz through landmark works like the 'Afro-Cuban Jazz Suite' for Charlie Parker and Machito in 1950, blending bebop harmonies with Cuban rhythms, and arranged for Dizzy Gillespie, Stan Kenton, and others, introducing the clave rhythm to jazz band sections[1][2][4].

In 1957, O'Farrill relocated to Mexico with his wife, singer Lupe Valero, composing a suite for Art Farmer in 1959 before returning to New York in 1965. He served as arranger and music director for CBS, created charts for Count Basie, and notably collaborated with trumpeter Clark Terry on the 1966 album *Spanish Rice*, featuring his Afro-Cuban jazz compositions. After years in the background, he staged a comeback in the 1990s, leading the Chico O’Farrill Afro-Cuban Jazz Big Band at Birdland, releasing Grammy-nominated *Pure Emotion* (1995), and premiering 'Trumpet Fantasy' with Wynton Marsalis. His symphonic style drew from Debussy and Stravinsky while preserving Cuban rhythms[1][2][4][7].

O'Farrill passed away on June 27, 2001, from pneumonia complications, leaving a legacy carried on by his son Arturo O'Farrill, who took over the band. His innovations fused Latin rhythms with big band jazz, influencing the genre profoundly through over 80 arrangements and compositions that showcased sweeping orchestration and rhythmic vitality[1][2].
