## Biography
Donald James Randolph, known professionally as Don Covay, was born on March 24, 1936, in Orangeburg, South Carolina, to a Baptist preacher who died when Covay was eight years old. His family moved to Washington, D.C., where he immersed himself in gospel, doo-wop, R&B, and soul music, starting his career in the 1950s as part of the Rainbows doo-wop group and joining Little Richard's revue in 1957 as a chauffeur and opening act, releasing his debut single 'Bip Bop Bip' under the name 'Pretty Boy.'[1][3][4]

Covay's breakthrough came as a songwriter with 'Pony Time' (co-written with John Berry), which reached No. 60 for him in 1961 before Chubby Checker took it to No. 1, followed by hits like 'Letter Full of Tears' for Gladys Knight & the Pips and 'I'm Hanging Up My Heart for You' for Solomon Burke. As a performer, he scored with 'Mercy, Mercy' in 1964 on Rosemart Records (featuring young Jimi Hendrix on guitar), reaching No. 35 on the Billboard Hot 100, and 'See-Saw' in 1965 co-written with Steve Cropper. His earthy, bluesy soul style shone through in the 1970s with Mercury Records hits like 'It's Better to Have (and Don't Need)' and 'Rumble in the Jungle,' alongside ventures like the Soul Clan supergroup (1968) and Jefferson Lemon Blues Band (1969-1970).[1][2][3]

Covay's legacy as a pioneering soul songwriter endures through covers by Aretha Franklin ('Chain of Fools,' Grammy winner), the Rolling Stones ('Mercy, Mercy'), Wilson Pickett, Steppenwolf, and others. He received a Pioneer Award from the Rhythm and Blues Foundation in 1994, worked as an A&R executive, and passed away on January 31, 2015, after a stroke.[2][3]
