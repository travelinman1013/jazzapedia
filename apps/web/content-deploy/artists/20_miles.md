## Biography
20 Miles is a blues-based garage rock duo formed as a side project by brothers Judah Bauer and Donovan Bauer, who had been performing together since high school. Judah, known for his role as guitarist in the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion (JSBX), and Donovan on drums, launched 20 Miles after the JSBX completed their 1996 album *Now I Got Worry*, allowing the siblings to explore raw blues, punk, garage rock, soul, rockabilly, and bluegrass influences in a more stripped-down format[1][4].

The band's debut album, *Twenty Miles* (1996), returned to blues basics with lo-fi production, while their follow-up *I'm a Lucky Guy* (1998) showcased muscular songwriting, high-fidelity sound, slinky grooves, spectral guitar lines, and harmonica-driven heavy rhythms that blended drinking-song vibes with diverse rock styles[1][4]. Though not a mainstream success (Spotify popularity: 3, genres: garage rock, folk punk), 20 Miles highlighted the Bauers' longstanding chemistry and Judah's melodic evolution beyond JSBX's punk energy[1][4].

The project remains a niche endeavor with limited output and no major legacy, but it underscores the brothers' roots in blues and their ability to fuse it with punk and rockabilly, appealing to garage rock enthusiasts[1][4].

## Fun Facts
- The Bauer brothers began playing music together in high school, predating both 20 Miles and Judah's JSBX career[1][4].
- 20 Miles formed specifically after JSBX finished *Now I Got Worry* in 1996, seizing the chance to pivot to pure blues[4].
- On *I'm a Lucky Guy*, Judah's guitar work is described as more melodic than his JSBX style, blending heavy grooves with harmonica[4].
- The duo's minimalist setup—just guitar and drums—created slinky, spectral tracks fusing garage rock, soul, rockabilly, and bluegrass[4].
