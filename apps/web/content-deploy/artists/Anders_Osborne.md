## Biography
Anders Osborne was born on May 4, 1966, in Uddevalla, Sweden, and became a Swedish-born American singer, songwriter, and guitarist who has established himself as one of New Orleans' most respected and original musical artists. At age 16, he left Sweden with a passion for music and wanderlust, traveling throughout Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, and Asia before arriving in New Orleans in 1986 at age 19. Inspired by blues as a unifying thread connecting rock, R&B, jazz, and singer-songwriter traditions, he adopted open D tuning after hearing it on Joni Mitchell's *Blue*, which became his signature guitar sound. He settled permanently in New Orleans, where he released his debut album *Doin' Fine* in 1989 and has since written virtually all of his own material while becoming deeply embedded in the city's vibrant music community.

Osborne's career reached new heights with his 2010 Alligator Records debut and 2012 follow-up *American Patchwork*, which earned him widespread critical acclaim and a devoted fanbase. His songwriting prowess extended beyond his own recordings—Tim McGraw scored a number-one country hit with Osborne's composition "Watch The Wind Blow By," and two songs co-written with Keb Mo appeared on Mo's Grammy-winning 1999 album *Slow Down*. His compositions have been covered by diverse artists including Brad Paisley, Tab Benoit, Jonny Lang, Kim Carnes, and Aaron Neville. Over nearly four decades in New Orleans, Osborne has earned recognition as *Guitar Player* magazine's "poet laureate of Louisiana's fertile roots music scene" and received multiple accolades from local publications, including *OffBeat* magazine naming him Best Guitarist three times and Best Songwriter twice, while *Gambit Weekly* honored him as Entertainer of the Year.

Beyond performance and recording, Osborne has become a cultural ambassador for New Orleans music, appearing at Jazz Fest for 35 years, teaching a course on art and the music business at Tulane University, and collaborating with Steve Earle at the annual Camp Copperhead songwriting camp since 2019. He has also contributed to film and television, including writing and recording the title track for the 2010 Kate Hudson film *Earthbound* and appearing in HBO's New Orleans-based drama *Treme*. His commitment to community extends to work with the "Send Me A Friend" foundation, the New Orleans Children's Museum, and various charitable organizations including the Trombone Shorty Foundation.
