## Biography
Bert Lown (born Albert Charles Lown; June 6, 1903 – November 20, 1962) was an American violinist, orchestra leader, and songwriter who became a prominent figure in jazz-oriented dance music during the 1920s and 1930s.[1] Born in White Plains, New York, Lown began his musical career as a sideman playing violin in Fred Hamm's band before establishing himself as a bandleader.[1] His most famous ensemble, the Biltmore Hotel Orchestra, became one of the era's notable dance bands and made extensive recordings for Victor Records, establishing "Bye Bye Blues" as the orchestra's signature song.[1][3]

Lown's compositional contributions extended beyond his most famous work, including songs such as "You're The One I Care For," "Tired," and "By My Side."[1] By the mid-1930s, he transitioned away from leading orchestras, becoming a booking agent and manager before eventually leaving the music industry entirely.[1] He later moved into executive positions in the television industry, marking a significant career shift from his earlier prominence in jazz and dance music. Lown died of a heart attack in 1962 in Portland, Oregon.[1]
