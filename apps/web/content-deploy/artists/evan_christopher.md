## Biography
Evan Christopher, born August 31, 1969, in Long Beach, California, began playing clarinet at age 11 and received his first musical training at the Idyllwild School of Music and the Arts, where he met influential bassist Marshall Hawkins. He studied saxophone at the University of Southern California under Dr. Thom Mason and graduated cum laude from California State University at Long Beach, studying clarinet with Gary Bovyer. Winning the Louis Armstrong National Jazz Award in high school marked his early promise, and in the early 1990s, he toured with singer-songwriter A.J. Croce, which led him to New Orleans in 1994.[2][4][5]

Christopher immersed himself in New Orleans' music scene, freelancing with legends like Al Hirt, Preservation Hall veterans, and bands such as the Nightcrawlers and Galactic. In 1996, he joined the Jim Cullum Jazz Band in San Antonio, Texas, as featured clarinetist for nearly three years, recording for the Riverwalk radio program. Returning to New Orleans in 2001, he pursued a Master’s in Musicology at Tulane University, researching the local clarinet style, and launched his 'Clarinet Road' CD series while touring internationally. Hurricane Katrina in 2005 displaced him to Paris via a French Embassy invitation, where he formed Django à la Créole, blending Gypsy jazz with New Orleans grooves, and the Jazz Traditions Project.[1][2][3][4]

Known for his dynamic 'close-encounter music' style rooted in New Orleans clarinet traditions, Christopher has composed acclaimed works like Delta Bound (2007) with Dick Hyman, The Remembering Song (2010) with Bucky Pizzarelli, and contributions to the Grammy-winning New Orleans Jazz Orchestra’s Book One (2012). His legacy includes 10 leader albums, 30 as sideman, the Treat It Gentle Suite concerto premiered with the Minnesota Symphony Orchestra in 2010, and ongoing advocacy for New Orleans music amid gentrification. He now resides in New York City.[1][2][3][4][6]
