## Biography
Kermit Ruffins, born December 19, 1964, in New Orleans, is a jazz trumpeter, singer, and composer who co-founded the Rebirth Brass Band in 1983 while attending Clark High School in the Tremé neighborhood. With high school classmate Philip Frazier on tuba and later Keith Frazier on bass drum, the band drew inspiration from the Dirty Dozen Brass Band and Olympia Brass Band, revolutionizing New Orleans brass band music by infusing it with funk, bebop, and contemporary elements. They performed in second-line parades and the French Quarter, releasing early recordings like the 1984 album *Here to Stay* and hits such as 'Do Whatcha Wanna,' which became anthems for the second-line culture.[1][2][3][4][5]

## Fun Facts
- Ruffins left the Rebirth Brass Band after nearly a decade of worldwide touring because he was a homebody who missed New Orleans culture so much that he cooked his favorite foods, like barbecue, in hotel rooms using portable equipment.
- He owns Kermit's Treme Speakeasy in New Orleans, where he performs weekly, and previously ran clubs like Sidney’s Saloon and the Mother-In-Law Lounge.
- On the night Barack Obama was elected president in 2008, Ruffins had his band play 'I Can See Clearly Now' on the sidewalk outside his club, a song Obama used at the Democratic Convention.
- The Rebirth Brass Band's first album *Here to Stay* was recorded in 1984 at the Grease Lounge on North Robertson Street, now the Candlelight Lounge.
