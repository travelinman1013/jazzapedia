## Biography
Wynonie Harris, born on August 24, 1915, in Omaha, Nebraska, to an unwed 15-year-old African American mother, Mallie Hood Anderson, and a Native American father possibly named Blue Jay, grew up without a father figure until his mother married Luther Harris in 1920. Dropping out of high school at 16 in 1931, he fathered two children out of wedlock before marrying Olive 'Ollie' Goodlow in 1936, with whom he had daughter Pattie; the family lived in North Omaha's Logan Fontenelle projects until moving to Los Angeles in 1940, leaving Pattie with her grandmother. Harris began as a dancer, forming a team with Velda Shannon in the early 1930s, performing at venues like the Ritz Theatre and Jim Bell's Harlem Club, where he transitioned to singing blues influenced by Kansas City shouters Jimmy Rushing and Big Joe Turner.[1][2][3][4]

Harris's career surged in the 1940s after relocating to L.A., where he emceed and sang on Central Avenue before Lucky Millinder hired him in 1944 for his orchestra, leading to his recording debut with Decca on 'Who Threw the Whiskey in the Well' and 'Hurry, Hurry.' Going solo in 1945 with Philo (later Aladdin), backed by Johnny Otis, he scored hits like 'Around the Clock,' 'Wynonie's Blues' with Illinois Jacquet, and 'Playful,' amassing fifteen Top 10 R&B hits by 1952 with his boisterous blues-shouting style, humorous and often ribald lyrics, blending boogie-woogie, swing, and proto-rock elements.[2][3][4][5]

Nicknamed 'Mr. Blues,' Harris is hailed as a rock and roll pioneer, influencing figures like Elvis Presley, though his chart success waned post-1952 amid personal excesses; he died on June 14, 1969. His legacy endures through Blues Hall of Fame induction (1994), Nebraska Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (1998), and Central High School Hall of Fame (2000).[2][3][4]
