## Biography
Glass Candy is an American electronic music duo formed in 1996 in Portland, Oregon by vocalist Ida No (born Lori Monahan) from Vancouver, Washington, and producer/multi-instrumentalist Johnny Jewel (born John Padgett) from Austin, Texas.[1][2] The two met in 1995 at a Fred Meyer grocery store in Portland where Jewel worked, and soon began producing music under the name Glass Candy and the Shattered Theatre.[2] Their early work, which they described as "droney and weird," drew heavily from no wave, post-punk, art rock, and glam rock, with self-released singles including "Brittle Women" (1999), "Metal Gods" (2001), and a cover of Josie Cotton's "Johnny Are You Queer" (2002).[1][2] Originally written off as no-talent art punks with glamorous aspirations, the band underwent a significant artistic transformation over the following decade.[4]

Glass Candy's breakthrough came with their debut studio album *Love Love Love* (2003) on Troubleman Unlimited Records, followed by their critically acclaimed second album *B/E/A/T/B/O/X* (2007) released on Italians Do It Better, a label founded by Jewel in 2006.[1][2] Their musical style evolved from early noise rock and electropop to incorporate synth-pop and Italo disco, creating what critics described as "chilled out italo disco that sounds like it is from New York in the 1980s."[4] The band's work gained significant recognition in the fashion world, with their songs featured in Chloé runway shows and Karl Lagerfeld's Spring/Summer 2008 Chanel Haute Couture and Fall/Winter 2008/2009 shows.[2] Following the compilation album *Deep Gems* (2008) and the EP *Feeling Without Touching* (2010), the band went on hiatus while working on their third studio album *Body Work*, with no subsequent full-length releases documented.[2] In 2013, Glass Candy performed at various international music festivals including Pitchfork in Paris and Primavera Sound in Spain.[2]
