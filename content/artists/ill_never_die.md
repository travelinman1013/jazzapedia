# I'll Never Die

## Biography
No credible biographical information is available for a musical artist named 'I'll Never Die' from the provided search results. The name appears to refer to a song title rather than an artist entity. Primary matches include a 1963 gospel recording 'I'll Never Die' by the **Louvin Brothers** (Charlie and Ira Louvin), a duo from Section, Alabama, known for country and gospel music.[1] Other results point to instrumental tracks by Daniel Gunnarsson or mentions in unrelated contexts like theater songs, but none establish 'I'll Never Die' as a performing artist with a biography.[2][3][4]
