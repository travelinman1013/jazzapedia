## Biography
Gerald Joseph Mulligan, known as Jeru, was born on April 6, 1927, in Queens, New York City, and raised in Philadelphia.[2][5] He began his musical education on piano before learning clarinet and saxophone.[2] In his late teens, Mulligan made his initial mark in the jazz world as an arranger, joining the Gene Krupa Orchestra in 1946 as an arranger and occasional alto saxophonist.[2][7] He subsequently arranged for Elliott Lawrence, Claude Thornhill, and other orchestras, establishing himself as a significant composer and arranger during the creative New York jazz scene of the late 1940s.[1][3]

Mulligan's most influential innovation came in 1951-1952 when he formed the first pianoless quartet in California, featuring trumpeter Chet Baker, bassist Carson Smith, and drummer Chico Hamilton.[1][4] This groundbreaking ensemble became a focal point of the West Coast Jazz movement and influenced musicians for decades.[1] Though a drugs-related jail sentence temporarily ended the quartet, Mulligan's partnership with trombonist Bob Brookmeyer after his 1954 release continued his success with expanded lineups.[2] Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, he led various ensembles—from small groups to his 1960 Concert Jazz Band, which performed at the Village Vanguard and recorded five albums for Verve Records.[1][4] Mulligan's contributions to the landmark 1948-1950 recording "Birth of the Cool" with Miles Davis' nonet cemented his place in modern jazz history.[1][2]

Mulligan remained active through the 1970s and 1980s, touring with Dave Brubeck from 1968-1972 and commissioning saxophone concertos to build a classical repertoire for the baritone saxophone.[3] He won a Grammy Award in 1981 for "Best Jazz Instrumental Performance by a Big Band" and received numerous other nominations throughout his career.[1][4] Consistently voted number one in jazz polls worldwide, Mulligan won a record twenty-nine consecutive Down Beat Readers Poll awards.[4] He passed away on January 20, 1996, leaving a legacy as one of the most respected jazz musicians of the twentieth century, recognized for his innovations in ensemble writing, his light and airy baritone saxophone tone, and his contributions to cool jazz and modern jazz development.[3]

## Fun Facts
- Mulligan lived in Marion for 10 years from age 1 to 10, where he studied his first music lessons and heard his first jazz.[6]
- Also known by the nickname 'Jeru,' Mulligan was one of the few baritone saxophonists to achieve such high visibility and played the instrument with remarkable grace despite its cumbersome nature.[5]
- In 1982, Zubin Mehta invited Mulligan to play soprano saxophone in a New York Philharmonic performance of Ravel's Boléro, showcasing his versatility beyond the baritone saxophone.[3]
- Mulligan was so committed to expanding the classical repertoire for baritone saxophone that in 1973 he commissioned composer Frank Proto to write a Saxophone Concerto, which was premiered with the Cincinnati Symphony.[3]
