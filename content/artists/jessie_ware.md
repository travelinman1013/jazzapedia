## Biography
Jessica Lois Ware, born on 15 October 1984 at Queen Charlotte's Hospital in Hammersmith, London, grew up in South London within a Jewish family. She attended Alleyn's School in Dulwich and later graduated from the University of Sussex with a degree in English literature. Initially pursuing journalism, Ware worked at The Jewish Chronicle, did sports reporting for The Daily Mirror, and assisted at Love Productions alongside future Fifty Shades author E.L. James, before a pivotal call from school friend Jack Peñate launched her music career as a backing vocalist for him and Man Like Me, including U.S. tours that honed her live performance skills[1][2][3].

Ware rose to prominence with her debut album *Devotion* (2012), peaking at number five on the UK Albums Chart and earning a Mercury Prize nomination, driven by singles like 'Wildest Moments.' Her follow-ups *Tough Love* (2014, number nine UK), *Glasshouse* (2017, number seven UK, featuring Ed Sheeran and Julia Michaels), *What's Your Pleasure?* (2020, number three UK, disco pivot critically acclaimed), and *That! Feels Good!* (2023, number three UK, Mercury-shortlisted) showcased her evolution from soulful pop to dance-oriented sounds. She has toured extensively, including the Devotion Tour (2012), Tough Love World Tour (2014), and That! Feels Good! Live! (2023), and co-hosts the popular podcast *Table Manners* with her mother Lennie since 2018[1][2].

With seven Brit Award nominations, including Best New Artist and four for British Female Solo Artist, plus two Mercury Prize nods, Ware's legacy blends emotive vocals, genre fluidity, and cultural impact through music and media, maintaining strong UK chart presence and global festival appearances[1].
