## Biography
Cliff Jackson was a renowned stride pianist born on July 19, 1902, in Culpeper, Virginia.[4][5] After establishing himself as a professional musician in Washington and Atlantic City, Jackson relocated to New York City in 1923, where he quickly became active in the jazz scene.[4][5] He played with Lionel Howard's Musical Aces in 1924 and recorded with various artists including Bob Fuller and Elmer Snowden beginning in 1924.[1][2][5] Jackson's most significant contribution to jazz came through his leadership of the Krazy Kats, a spirited ten-piece ensemble he formed in January 1927.[4][5] The band, which featured notable sidemen including trumpeter Henry Goodwin and clarinetist-altoist Rudy Powell, recorded 15 selections across two sessions in 1930, producing exuberant recordings such as "Horse Feathers," "Torrid Rhythm," and "The Terror."[1][3] Though based in New York, the group maintained a raw, territory band sound characterized by enthusiasm and spirit rather than technical polish.[3]

Following the Krazy Kats' dissolution around 1932, Jackson transitioned to working primarily as a solo pianist and vocal accompanist in New York nightclubs, establishing himself as a house pianist at Cafe Society from 1943 to 1951.[5] Despite his considerable talent as a stride pianist, Jackson never achieved widespread fame in the jazz world.[2] However, his recording career remained active throughout his life, with notable sessions including collaborations with Sidney Bechet in 1940-41, recordings with Pee Wee Russell in 1944-45, and later work with various ensembles in 1961 and 1969.[2][5] Jackson died on May 24, 1970, leaving behind a legacy as a skilled but underrecognized stride pianist who bridged early jazz and later swing-era styles.[4]

## Fun Facts
- Despite being one of the most powerful stride pianists of his era, Cliff Jackson never became widely famous in the jazz world, remaining relatively obscure compared to his contemporaries.[2]
- The Krazy Kats, though based in New York, deliberately maintained a raw, territory band sound that was intentionally rough and occasionally out-of-tune, displaying what critics described as "a joyful spirit" and asking 'What Depression?' during the Great Depression era.[1][3]
- Jackson's recording career spanned nearly five decades, from his debut in 1924 accompanying classic blues singers to his final recordings in 1969, demonstrating remarkable longevity in the jazz field.[1][2]
- As a house pianist at Cafe Society from 1943 to 1951, Jackson achieved great success in one of New York's most prestigious jazz venues, and he also toured with renowned bandleader Eddie Condon in 1946.[5]
