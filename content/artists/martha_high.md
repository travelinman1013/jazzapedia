## Biography
Martha High (born Martha Harvin in 1945 in Victoria, Virginia) is an American soul, R&B, and funk vocalist best known for her three-decade tenure as a featured singer with James Brown’s revue.[2][3][6][7] She grew up in Washington, D.C., attended Roosevelt High School, and sang in the choir at Trinity AME Zion Church, where she developed her voice and met the young women who would become The Four Jewels.[2][3] Still in high school, she auditioned for The Four Jewels, joined after impressing the group, and helped them transition into The Jewels, scoring a regional hit with the single “Opportunity” and touring elite nightclubs and theaters along the U.S. East Coast.[2][3]

During a mid‑1960s Apollo Theater tour, The Jewels caught the attention of James Brown, who invited them to join his James Brown Revue as an opening act and support vocal group.[1][2][3] When The Jewels eventually disbanded, Harvin chose to remain with Brown, who renamed her Martha High and later dubbed her “The Goddess of Soul.”[1][2][3] She went on to perform and record with him for more than 30 years, appearing on albums such as *The James Brown Show* (1967) and on tracks including their duet “Summertime,” as well as touring internationally and appearing on television and in films like *The Blues Brothers*.[1][2][3] In 1979 Brown produced her self‑titled disco album for Salsoul Records and also cut singles such as “Georgie Girl” / “Try Me.”[2][3] After leaving Brown’s band around 2000, High relaunched herself as a solo artist, touring with saxophonist Maceo Parker, fronting European bands such as Speedometer, Shaolin Temple Defenders, and others, and issuing albums including *It’s High Time*, *Soul Overdue* (with Speedometer), *Singing for the Good Times*, and *Got My Senses Back*.[2][3][6][7]

High’s musical style blends classic soul, R&B, funk, gospel, and retro soul, marked by a church‑honed vocal power, bluesy phrasing, and a deep affinity for the James Brown funk tradition.[1][2][3][6] Beyond performance, she has worked as a vocal instructor and mentor, leading workshops and master classes (often in and around Paris), and hosting her radio show *It’s High Time* from 2020, where she interviews musicians and celebrities she has worked with.[1][3] Internationally respected as one of the “Original Funky Divas,” she has helped sustain the legacy of James Brown and classic American soul while building her own late‑career catalog that has introduced her voice to new generations of funk and retro‑soul listeners.[1][2][4][5][7]
