## Biography
Milton 'Milt' Jackson was born on January 1, 1923, in Detroit, Michigan, and became the modern jazz era's first and most influential vibraphone player.[1] He discovered his musical affinity early, picking out tunes on piano by ear at age seven, and began his professional career singing gospel duets with his brother in the early 1940s.[5][6] After being discovered by Dizzy Gillespie in a Detroit club in 1945, Jackson moved to New York and quickly established himself as a virtuoso vibraphonist, working with bebop's leading figures including Charlie Parker, Thelonious Monk, Coleman Hawkins, and the Woody Herman Orchestra between 1948 and 1950.[1][3]

Jackson's most significant contribution to jazz came through his co-founding of the Modern Jazz Quartet in 1952, which became his principal performance vehicle until 1974.[1][2] The MJQ, featuring pianist John Lewis, bassist Percy Heath, and drummer Kenny Clarke (later replaced by Connie Kay in 1954), became an enduring jazz institution that toured the world and recorded steadily, performing both cool jazz and third-stream music that blended European classical techniques with jazz improvisation.[2][6] Jackson's playing style was characterized by a slower vibrato than his predecessors, vocal-like inflections, and fluent lines of eighth and sixteenth notes derived from bebop's advanced harmonies.[1][5] Beyond the MJQ, he recorded prolifically as a sideman and leader, including classic sessions with Miles Davis ('Bags' Groove'), Thelonious Monk (Evidence, Criss Cross), and collaborations with tenor saxophonists Coleman Hawkins, John Coltrane, and Lucky Thompson.[1] After the MJQ disbanded in 1974, Jackson led his own groups until the quartet reunited in 1981 for a concert in Japan, subsequently performing annually through the early 1990s, making them the only group in jazz history to maintain the same personnel for over forty years.[5][6] Jackson remained active until his death on October 9, 1999, having spent 50 years at the top of his field playing bop, blues, and ballads with equal skill and sensitivity.[3]

## Fun Facts
- Jackson earned the nickname 'Bags' early in his career, which stuck with him throughout his life.[1]
- When Jackson first attempted to sit in with a bebop band at a club on New York's 52nd Street, the club owner wouldn't even let him in the door—yet within a year he was performing as a featured artist with Dizzy Gillespie's big band at the same venue.[6]
- Jackson was drafted into the military in 1942 just as he was offered a job with the Earl Hines Orchestra, delaying his breakthrough; after his discharge in 1944, he returned to Detroit and made his recording debut with Dinah Washington.[4]
- Jackson elevated the vibraphone from a novelty instrument to one that commanded respect in jazz clubs and concert halls, fundamentally changing the instrument's status in jazz.[6]
