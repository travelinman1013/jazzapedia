## Biography
Clarence Williams' Blue Five was a studio recording band formed in the early 1920s by pianist and bandleader Clarence Williams to capitalize on the market for blues-oriented music following the success of King Oliver's recordings.[1] The ensemble became one of the most significant recording projects of the early jazz era, featuring some of the finest musicians of the time. Between 1923 and 1925, the Blue Five recorded a series of landmark sessions that showcased the emerging talents of Louis Armstrong and Sidney Bechet in their only recordings together before the 1940s.[1] The band operated primarily as a studio project rather than a touring ensemble, with Williams carefully assembling different lineups of top-tier musicians for each recording session.

The Blue Five's recordings are treasured today for capturing pivotal moments in jazz history, including classics such as "Cakewalkin' Babies," "Wildcat Blues," and "Kansas City Man Blues."[2] These sessions marked the recorded emergence of Sidney Bechet and Louis Armstrong as major soloists, with Armstrong's poised and innovative playing contrasting with Bechet's passionate, dominating soprano saxophone style.[4] The ensemble typically featured Williams on piano and vocals, Armstrong on cornet, Bechet on soprano saxophone, and various supporting musicians including trombonist Charlie Irvis and banjoist Buddy Christian.[4] The Blue Five's influence extended far beyond their recording sessions, establishing a template for small jazz ensembles and helping to define the sound of early New Orleans jazz as it evolved in New York.

## Fun Facts
- The first recording session of the Blue Five occurred on October 17, 1924, for 'Texas Moaner Blues,' which is considered one of the great early jazz records, with Sidney Bechet delivering passionate, almost animalistic playing that stole the show from Armstrong's poised solo.[4]
- Clarence Williams claimed to be the first songwriter to use the word 'jazz' on a piece of sheet music and had business cards touting him as 'The Originator of Jazz and Boogie Woogie.'[6]
- Williams was so prolific that his approximately 150 recordings were issued under some two dozen different band names including Clarence Williams Novelty Four, Clarence Williams Washboard Four, Memphis Jazzers, Seven Gallon Jug Band, Jamaica Jazzers, and Dixie Washboard Band, a common industry practice when recording for competing labels.[2]
- Willie 'The Lion' Smith credited Williams as the first New Orleans musician to influence jazz in New York, recognizing his pivotal role in bringing the New Orleans sound to the northern jazz scene.[3]
