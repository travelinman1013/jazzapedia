## Biography
Robert Allen Palmer was born on January 19, 1949, in Batley, Yorkshire, England, though his family moved to Malta shortly after where his father worked in British naval intelligence. Returning to the UK at age 12, he was deeply influenced by blues, soul, and jazz from American Forces Radio and his parents' tastes. At 15, he attended Scarborough School of Art & Design but dropped out after losing coursework, forming his first band, The Mandrakes, which supported acts like The Who and Jimi Hendrix. He joined the Alan Bown Set in 1969 as lead singer, recording their album *The Alan Bown!*, then moved to London for jazz-rock band Dada, which evolved into Vinegar Joe with Elkie Brooks and Pete Gage, releasing three Island Records albums from 1972-1973.[1][2][3]
