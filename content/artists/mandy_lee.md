## Biography
Mandy Lee, born Amanda Lee Duffy in Queens, New York, discovered her passion for songwriting during a class at LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts, where she penned early tracks like 'Oceans.' Her musical career ignited in late 2012 when she sought an '80s cover band for her birthday party, leading to the formation of the indie pop band MisterWives with initial members Etienne Bowler (percussion/drums) and William Hehir (bass), later joined by Marc Campbell (guitar), Jesse Blum (multi-instrumentalist), and Mike Murphy (sax).[1][2][4][5] The band quickly gained traction, signing with Photo Finish Records, releasing the debut EP *Reflections* in 2014, and their full-length album *Our Own House* in 2015, which peaked at number 31 on the Billboard charts and featured Lee's dynamic vocals across indie pop, alternative, and punk-infused sounds.[2][4][5]

MisterWives toured extensively, opening for acts like Twenty One Pilots, Bleachers, American Authors, and Panic! at the Disco, while performing at major festivals including Lollapalooza, South by Southwest, Governors Ball, and Bonnaroo. They released subsequent albums *Connect the Dots* (2017), *SUPERBLOOM* (2020) under Fueled by Ramen, and *Nosebleeds* (2023), with Lee's songwriting often drawing from personal experiences like heartbreak following her 2019 breakup with bandmate Etienne Bowler.[2][3][5] By 2026, after the band's hiatus post-*Nosebleeds*, Lee launched her solo project Cherry Bomb, embracing disco-influenced sounds, bold visuals, and themes of joy, community, and personal evolution while maintaining her roots as a storyteller.[3][8]

Lee's style blends high-energy indie pop with eclectic instrumentation, powerful vocals, and raw emotional narratives, establishing her as a commanding frontwoman in a male-dominated genre. Her legacy includes inspiring female fans through fervent live performances and fostering community at shows, with MisterWives amassing millions of streams and Cherry Bomb marking her bold artistic independence.[2][3][5]

## Fun Facts
- MisterWives formed serendipitously when Lee booked an '80s cover band for her birthday party, recruiting Etienne Bowler and William Hehir from it to start jamming together.[1][2][3]
- She wrote much of MisterWives' debut album *Our Own House* in a treehouse in Riverdale, New York.[2]
- Lee's 2020 album *SUPERBLOOM* was inspired by a visit to California's Antelope Valley Superbloom poppy fields during a period of personal healing post-breakup.[5]
- The band name 'MisterWives' is a playful twist on 'sister wife,' highlighting Lee as the only female member.[2]
