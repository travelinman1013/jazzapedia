## Biography
Original Concept was a short-lived but influential hip-hop group from New York that emerged in the mid‑1980s out of the college radio scene. The crew initially formed around the show “The Operating Room” on Adelphi University’s WBAU-FM, where Dr. Dre (Andre Brown – not to be confused with Dr. Dre from N.W.A.), T-Money (Tyrone Kelsie), and Rapper G (Gregory Rogers) were on‑air personalities and DJs; they were closely associated with fellow WBAU crew Public Enemy, who also came out of the same station and scene.[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_Concept] Their early appearances on the influential compilation *The Uprock* (1986) and as hosts/MCs on various mix shows helped them transition from DJs and radio personalities into recording artists signed to Profile Records.[https://www.allmusic.com/artist/original-concept-mn0000485514/biography]

The group’s recording career is best known for the 1988 album *Straight from the Basement of Kooley High!*, a largely instrumental, sample‑heavy record built around sparse drum programming, funk samples, and Jamaican sound‑system sensibilities.[https://www.allmusic.com/album/straight-from-the-basement-of-kooley-high%21-mw0000652559][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_from_the_Basement_of_Kooley_High!] Their earlier 1986 single “Knowledge Me” / “Can You Feel It” showcased a minimalist, groove‑driven style and DJ‑centered production that prefigured later emphasis on beats over dense lyricism.[https://www.allmusic.com/artist/original-concept-mn0000485514/biography] Although they were from New York rather than Florida, their stripped‑down, bass‑forward, DJ‑oriented approach intersected with the broader rise of club‑ and bass‑driven hip‑hop in the late 1980s. Original Concept disbanded after one album, but members went on to careers in radio, television, and behind‑the‑scenes production, and the group’s work remains a cult favorite among DJs and crate‑diggers drawn to early sample‑based and DJ‑centric hip‑hop.[https://www.allmusic.com/artist/original-concept-mn0000485514/biography][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_Concept]

## Fun Facts
- Original Concept’s Dr. Dre is a completely different artist from the more famous West Coast Dr. Dre (Andre Young); this Dr. Dre (Andre Brown) was a New York radio personality and later a television host.[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_Concept]
- The group evolved directly from a college radio show, “The Operating Room” on Adelphi University’s WBAU-FM, turning on‑air DJs and hosts into a signed recording act.[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_Concept]
- Their only full-length album, *Straight from the Basement of Kooley High!* (1988), is predominantly instrumental and sample‑based, which was unusual for a hip‑hop group marketed in the MC‑dominated late 1980s.[https://www.allmusic.com/album/straight-from-the-basement-of-kooley-high%21-mw0000652559]
- Despite a very small catalog, Original Concept’s records—especially “Can You Feel It” and the *Kooley High* album—have become sought‑after by collectors for their early, minimal, funk‑driven production style.[https://www.allmusic.com/artist/original-concept-mn0000485514/biography]

### Mentors/Influences
- [[the_wbau-fm__adelphi_university_hip-hop_radio_community_including_chuck_d_and_public_enemy_members|The WBAU-FM / Adelphi University hip-hop radio community (including Chuck D and Public Enemy members)]] - Original Concept developed within the same WBAU-FM environment and programming circle that nurtured Chuck D and what became Public Enemy; they were colleagues and peers in a tightly knit campus-radio scene that helped shape their on-air style, DJ skills, and early exposure. (WBAU-FM shows such as “The Operating Room” and other mid‑1980s hip-hop programs where Original Concept and future Public Enemy members appeared and cross‑pollinated.) [Early–mid 1980s]

### Key Collaborators
- [[public_enemy|Public Enemy]] - Public Enemy and Original Concept came out of the same WBAU-FM crew; they appeared on each other’s recordings and shared personnel in the early stages of their careers. (Original Concept is credited with appearances and contributions around the Bomb Squad/Public Enemy camp in the late 1980s, reflecting a shared creative circle on Profile and Def Jam’s orbit.) [Mid–late 1980s]
- [[profile_records_roster_including_run-d.m.c._and_other_labelmates|Profile Records roster (including Run-D.M.C. and other labelmates)]] - As part of Profile Records, Original Concept shared label infrastructure, promotion circuits, and sometimes live bills with other Profile acts, situating them within a key 1980s New York hip-hop network. (Label compilations and joint promotional campaigns associated with Profile Records’ mid‑1980s hip-hop releases.) [1986–1989]

### Artists Influenced
- [[later_sample-based_djcentric_east_coast_producers_and_cratedigging_djs|Later sample-based, DJ‑centric East Coast producers and crate‑digging DJs]] - Original Concept’s largely instrumental, break‑ and sample‑driven album *Straight from the Basement of Kooley High!* became a cult reference point for DJs and producers interested in stripped‑down, bass‑heavy, funk‑sampled hip‑hop. (Influence is most commonly noted in relation to *Straight from the Basement of Kooley High!* (1988) and the single “Can You Feel It” among collectors and underground DJs.) [1990s–2000s (retrospective influence)]
