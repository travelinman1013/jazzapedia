## Biography
Janis Joplin was born in Port Arthur, Texas, in 1943, and fell under the sway of artists like Big Mama Thornton who influenced her to become a singer.[5] In 1966, Joplin's bluesy vocal style attracted the attention of the San Francisco-based psychedelic rock band Big Brother and the Holding Company, which had gained renown among the nascent hippie community in Haight-Ashbury.[1] She was recruited to join the group by promoter Chet Helms, a fellow Texan with whom she had hitchhiked from Texas to San Francisco years earlier.[1] Joplin joined Big Brother on June 4, 1966, and made her first public performance with them at the Avalon Ballroom in San Francisco.[1]

In 1967, Joplin rose to prominence following an appearance at the Monterey Pop Festival, where Big Brother and the Holding Company's performance became a defining moment in rock music history.[1][4] The band recorded their debut album in December 1966, which was released in August 1967 shortly after their Monterey success.[3] In 1968, Big Brother signed with Columbia Records under manager Albert Grossman, and they produced the album 'Cheap Thrills,' which many consider their masterpiece and one of the greatest albums of all time, quickly rising to #1 on the charts and staying there for eight weeks.[2] At the end of 1968, Joplin left Big Brother and the Holding Company to pursue a solo career, first forming the Kozmic Blues Band and later the Full Tilt Boogie Band, with which she expressed greater creative control, famously stating, "It's my band. Finally it's my band!"[1]

## Fun Facts
- Joplin deceived her parents about her destination when joining Big Brother, telling them she was moving to Austin, Texas to join a rock band, when she was actually relocating to San Francisco.[1]
- The Hells Angels, who had known Joplin since 1966, paid her a fee of $240 to perform at a party they hosted that was attended by 2,300 people in May 1970.[1]
- Joplin had an on-again-off-again romantic relationship with Peggy Caserta, whom she first met in November 1966 when Big Brother performed at The Matrix in San Francisco; Caserta was one of only 15 people in the audience and ran a clothing boutique called Mnasidika in the Haight-Ashbury.[1]
- Joplin took a more active role in assembling the Full Tilt Boogie Band than she had with her previous groups, and she was notably happy with this new band, which received mostly positive feedback from both fans and critics.[1]
