# JIMMIE GORDON

## Biography
Jimmie Gordon (probably 1906 – possibly October 27, 1993) was an American Chicago blues pianist, singer, and songwriter whose early life remains largely unknown, with details obscured by rumor and speculation; he was once thought to be from St. Louis based on a recording association, but this is unconfirmed. By 1934, he had secured a recording contract, primarily with Decca Records (aside from one early Bluebird side), where he became a mainstay through the 1930s and early 1940s, recording 67 tracks until 1946. His work often featured his own piano accompaniment, supplemented by guitar or small bands he assembled, blending blues and jazz elements.[1][4][7]

Gordon's career highlighted his skills as a versatile accompanist and solo artist, backing luminaries like Memphis Minnie, Bumble Bee Slim, and Big Bill Broonzy, while leading ensembles such as the Vip Vop Band and later the Bip Bop Band for 1946 jump blues releases on King and Queen labels. His songwriting shone in hits like 'I'd Rather Drink Muddy Water' (1936), a commercial success, and socially conscious tracks like 'Don't Take Away My P.W.A.' (1936), referencing Depression-era public works. He also ventured into dirty blues with songs like 'Hard Lead Pencil' and 'How You Want It Done,' later compiled on Document Records albums. Stylistically, Gordon was a passable pianist with a warm, convincing singing voice, pioneering jazz-blues fusion band arrangements that influenced later blues groups.[1][6][7]

Post-World War II, Gordon faded from prominence, with his legacy preserved through reissues and recognition as a key Chicago blues figure. Credited with writing 'Mean Mistreater,' later covered by Muddy Waters and Johnny Winter, his contributions to piano blues, ragtime, and boogie-woogie endure, though biographical gaps persist.[1][7]
