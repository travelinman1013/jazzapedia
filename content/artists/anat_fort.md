## Biography
Anat Fort is an Israeli jazz pianist, composer, and educator born on March 8, 1970, near Tel Aviv.[1] She began playing piano at age five and received classical training in Israel before discovering jazz in her late teens.[2][6] Fort moved to the United States to study jazz improvisation and composition, initially attending William Paterson University in New Jersey and later relocating to New York in 1996 to study under pianist Paul Bley and composer Harold Seletsky.[1] During her early years in New York, she supported herself through versatile piano work—accompanying actors at the Lee Strasberg school, performing classical, jazz, cabaret, and musical theater pieces, often playing multiple gigs nightly.[3] This period of immersion in New York's jazz scene proved formative for her artistic development.

Fort's professional recording career began with her self-produced debut album *Peel* in 1999, which featured all original compositions.[1][2] In the same year, she formed the Anat Fort Trio with bassist Gary Wang and drummer Roland Schneider, a collaboration that would define her career for over two decades.[4] Her breakthrough came in 2004 when she recorded *A Long Story* with drummer Paul Motian and other jazz luminaries, which caught the attention of ECM Records producer Manfred Eicher.[1][3] The album was released by ECM in 2007 to outstanding international reviews, making Fort the first Israeli artist signed to the prestigious label.[3][4] She has since released three albums with ECM—*A Long Story* (2007), *And If* (2010), and *Birdwatching* (2016)—all featuring her original compositions.[4] In December 2018, Fort won the Prime Minister's Jazz Composers Award in Israel, becoming the first woman to receive this honor.[4] Her recent work includes *Colour* (2019), celebrating the trio's 20-year anniversary on Sunnyside Records, and a collaborative lullaby album with vocalist Ayelet Rose Gottlieb.[4] Fort has also completed a PhD in composition at Bar-Ilan University and continues to perform internationally at major venues and festivals.[4]
