## Biography
Merl Saunders (1934-2008) was born in San Mateo, California, and began playing piano at a young age, performing at San Francisco rec center dances by junior high. After serving in the U.S. Army from 1953 to 1957, he launched his professional career in show bands and jazz groups, working as musical director for the Billy Williams Revue and Oscar Brown Jr.'s *Big Time Buck White*, and performing with artists like Dinah Washington, Lionel Hampton, and B.B. King. A disciple of Hammond B3 organ masters Jimmy Smith and Jack McDuff, Saunders spent years on the road with an organ trio, did session work in New York City, played commercials, and conducted at the Riviera Hotel in Las Vegas before returning to the Bay Area.[1][2][3][5]

In the late 1960s, Saunders connected with the San Francisco music scene, meeting Jerry Garcia through bassist John Kahn at Wally Heider Studios while recording with singer Danny Cox. Their collaboration ignited in 1971, forming the Garcia/Saunders band and later Legion of Mary (1974-1975), blending jazz, rock, and Latin flavors in danceable jams at Bay Area clubs and national tours, with members like Kahn, Bill Vitt, Martin Fierro, and Ron Tutt. Garcia credited Saunders with teaching him harmonic sophistication, standards, bebop, and musical structure beyond rock. They reunited for projects like Saunders' group Reconstruction (1979, with Garcia), *The New Twilight Zone* soundtrack (1985, with Grateful Dead), and *Blues from the Rainforest* (1990).[1][2][3][4]

Saunders' versatile legacy spans jamband culture, guest spots with Phish and Widespread Panic, and film/TV soundtracks like *Fritz the Cat*. After a stroke over six years prior, he died on October 24, 2008, from complications, remaining a beloved Bay Area figure.[2][3]
