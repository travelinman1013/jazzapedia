## Biography
Kris Kristofferson was a pioneering figure in the outlaw country movement who became one of America's finest living songwriters and a versatile actor.[1][3] Born on June 22, 1936, in Brownsville, Texas, Kristofferson was an accomplished writer and athlete who attended Pomona College in California.[2] After college, he enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1960, where he trained as a ranger and helicopter pilot while stationed in West Germany.[1][2] During his military service, he maintained his passion for music and eventually organized a soldiers' band. In 1965, after achieving the rank of captain, he was offered a position as an English instructor at West Point, but after visiting Nashville that June, he made a pivotal decision to resign from the military and pursue a career as a country music songwriter.[1]

Kristofferson's music career took off after being signed to Monument Records in 1969 by Chet Atkins, who was impressed by his songwriting.[3] He achieved Grammy success in 1972, sweeping the Grammy Awards with numerous nominations and winning country song of the year for "Help Me Make It Through the Night."[3] Throughout the 1970s and beyond, he recorded extensively for Monument Records and other labels, establishing himself as a major force in country music.[3] In 1985, Kristofferson was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame and joined country superstars Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson, and Waylon Jennings to form The Highwaymen, a supergroup that achieved significant commercial success with their debut album *Highwayman* reaching number one on the Billboard country charts.[1][2] The Borderlords served as his long-standing backup band during his touring years.[4][5]

Beyond music, Kristofferson became a renowned actor, landing his film debut in 1971 and earning a Golden Globe for Best Actor for his role in *A Star Is Born* (1976).[1][3] He appeared in numerous notable films including *Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid* (1973), the *Blade* trilogy (1998–2004), and *Payback* (1999).[3] His final studio album, *The Cedar Creek Sessions*, was released in 2016 and nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Americana Album.[3] Kristofferson passed away on September 28, 2024, leaving behind a legacy as an activist, country music elder statesman, and inductee of the Country Music Hall of Fame.[3][5]
