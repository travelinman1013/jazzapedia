# Billy Strings & Don Julin

## Biography
Billy Strings & Don Julin was a virtuosic bluegrass duo from Traverse City, Michigan, pairing the fiery flatpicking guitar of Billy Strings (William Apostol) with the inventive mandolin work of veteran musician Don Julin. Strings, born in 1992 and raised in a musical family, grew up steeped in traditional bluegrass and especially the music of Doc Watson, developing formidable guitar skills from a very young age.[2][3][6] Julin, who began playing mandolin in 1979 after being inspired by the David Grisman Quintet, built a wide‑ranging career in Michigan as a mandolinist, commercial composer, recording engineer, and educator before being drawn more deeply into bluegrass through his partnership with Strings.[1][5]

Around 2011–2012, after Strings moved to Traverse City, Julin sought him out at a local coffeehouse gig, immediately recognizing the young guitarist’s extraordinary command of traditional bluegrass and Doc Watson’s style.[3][5] They soon began playing together, rehearsing Doc Watson tunes and quickly discovering a natural musical chemistry that led to their first local gigs and, shortly thereafter, broader regional touring.[1][3] As a working duo, they stripped bluegrass classics and original material down to guitar and mandolin while injecting extended, jazz‑like improvisations and a subtle rock edge, creating high‑energy performances that felt both traditional and experimental.[1][4] Their collaboration produced recordings such as “Rock of Ages” (2013) and “Fiddle Tune X” (2014), helping launch Billy Strings onto the national bluegrass scene while giving Julin a widely visible platform for his boundary‑pushing mandolin style.[1][5]

Musically, Billy Strings & Don Julin balanced deep respect for first‑generation bluegrass with a willingness to stretch the form. Critics and festival programmers noted how they honored figures like Doc Watson while incorporating elements drawn from jazz, rock, and broader Americana, particularly in their extended solos and improvisational interplay.[1][3][4][5] Their time together, which lasted roughly four years, coincided with Strings’ transition from a regional “guitar‑slinger kid” to a rising bluegrass star, a period during which Julin also introduced him to artists such as John Hartford, Tom Waits, and Sun Ra and exposed him to the professional side of the acoustic music circuit.[2][3] Although both later continued on separate paths—Strings as a Grammy‑winning headliner and Julin as a respected mandolin teacher, author, and recording artist—the duo is often credited with helping redefine modern bluegrass duos and with playing a pivotal role in launching one of contemporary bluegrass’s most influential guitarists.[2][3][5][6]

## Fun Facts
- Don Julin first sought out Billy Strings after hearing rumors about a young “guitar‑slinger kid” in Traverse City; he brought his laptop to a coffeehouse gig, listened to a set, and invited Strings to play together that same night.[3]
- Early in their partnership, Billy Strings impressed Julin by producing what Julin called the largest collection of Doc Watson LPs he had ever seen, and the two spent the evening playing Doc Watson tunes together.[3]
- In live shows, the duo routinely departed from traditional bluegrass norms by launching into five‑minute or longer guitar and mandolin solos, an approach Julin explicitly traced to jazz rather than bluegrass.[1]
- Their success as a hard‑touring two‑piece eventually landed them a booking deal with the same agency that handled bluegrass heavyweights like Del McCoury and Hot Rize, a significant step up from their early coffeehouse gigs.[1]
