## Biography
Full Cord is a bluegrass band from West Michigan, particularly associated with Grand Haven, Michigan, USA, that formed around 2012 as a serendipitous meeting between guitarist Eric Langejans and bassist Todd Kirchner while camping at the Charlotte Bluegrass Festival. The band evolved from this 'total fluke' encounter, with Langejans and Kirchner building a core that blended traditional bluegrass with jazz, western swing, rock n' roll, and newgrass elements, maintaining a banjo-less sound at times while occasionally incorporating banjo players. Members bring decades of experience: Kirchner started on bass in his early teens with family bluegrass sessions, Langejans is known as 'Fast Eric' for his rapid guitar riffs and multi-instrumental skills including mandolin and fiddle, while later additions like mandolinist Brian Oberlin and fiddler Grant Flick elevated their sound with international acclaim and award-winning pedigrees.[1][2][5]

The band's career gained momentum with albums like *Choreomania* (2019), which won WYCE’s Jammie award for Best New Album by a New Band and featured originals from Oberlin, Langejans, and Flick; *Hindsight* (2021), focused on pandemic-era originals; *Chop* (2018); and their Nashville-recorded debut *Cambium* (2023) on Dark Shadow Recording, which charted into 2024 and earned praise from Billy Strings. They earned the “Momentum Award Band of the Year” and have performed at festivals like North Cascades Bluegrass Festival, Charlotte Bluegrass Festival, and others, delivering high-energy shows with contemporary sensibilities rooted in deep bluegrass tradition.[2][3][4][5]

Full Cord's musical style emphasizes fresh, original material alongside covers, sparking seasoned fans with innovative takes on classics, as noted by Oberlin. Their legacy includes building a regional following in Michigan over 14 years, fostering collaborations with top players, and contributing to the newgrass evolution through skilled instrumentation and songwriting that transports listeners to jam sessions.[1][2][9]
