## Biography
John Coltrane was born on September 23, 1926, in Hamlet, North Carolina, into a family shaped by deep faith and music, with his father a preacher and his grandfather a minister. He began playing clarinet as a teenager before switching to saxophone in high school, enlisted in the Navy where he performed with the band in Hawaii from 1945-1946, and after discharge immersed himself in Philadelphia's jazz scene. His early career involved paying dues as a sideman in R&B groups like Eddie 'Cleanhead' Vinson's (1947-1948), Jimmy Heath’s band, Howard McGhee All Stars, and Dizzy Gillespie's big band (1949-1951), switching to tenor sax and taking his first recorded solo in 1951, though heroin addiction led to firings, including from Gillespie in 1954.[1][2][3][4][5]

## Fun Facts
- Coltrane developed his 'sheets of sound' technique in 1957 through relentless practice, slaloming through scalar patterns and harmonic stacks, as coined by critic Ira Gitler.[2]
- His 1957 Blue Train album, recorded for Blue Note with peers like Johnny Splawn and Sahib Shihab, is hailed as one of the greatest jazz records ever.[1]
- Coltrane kicked his heroin habit around 1957 after firings, including from Miles Davis, which freed him to record prolifically as a leader starting May 31, 1957.[1]
- He viewed music as a spiritual force for good, stating: 'I want to be the force which is truly for good,' aligning his work with civil rights era consciousness.[2][4][5]
