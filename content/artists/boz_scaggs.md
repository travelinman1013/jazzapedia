## Biography
William Royce "Boz" Scaggs was born on June 8, 1944, in Canton, Ohio, and grew up in Oklahoma and Texas, where he developed a deep passion for blues, R&B, and rock music.[3][5] He began his musical journey in 1959 as the vocalist for Steve Miller's band, the Marksmen, and later attended the University of Wisconsin–Madison with Miller, playing in blues bands including the Ardells and the Fabulous Knight Trains.[3] After leaving school in 1963 to pursue music full-time, Scaggs formed the band the Wigs and briefly relocated to London in 1965 to participate in the emerging R&B scene, though the group disbanded after achieving little success.[2][3] In 1967, he rejoined Steve Miller in San Francisco and appeared on the Steve Miller Band's first two albums, *Children of the Future* and *Sailor* (1968), before departing due to musical differences.[2][3]

Scaggs launched his solo career in 1968 with a contract from Atlantic Records, releasing his self-titled debut album in 1969, which featured the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section and session guitarist Duane Allman but achieved only moderate commercial success.[2][3] Throughout the early 1970s, he recorded several albums for Columbia Records, including *Moments* (1971) and *My Time* (1972), before achieving breakthrough success with *Silk Degrees* (1976), which peaked at number 2 on the Billboard 200 and produced hit singles "Lido Shuffle" and "Lowdown."[1][3] He followed this with two more platinum-certified albums, *Down Two Then Left* and *Middle Man*, the latter generating top-40 singles "Breakdown Dead Ahead" and "Jojo."[1][3] After a hiatus during most of the 1980s, Scaggs returned to recording and touring in 1988 with the album *Other Roads*, which produced his last top-40 hit "Heart of Mine."[3] He has continued to record and tour throughout subsequent decades, with recent albums including 2018's *Out of the Blues* and 2025's *Detour*.[3] Beyond music, Scaggs opened the San Francisco nightclub Slim's in 1988, which remained a popular music venue until its closure in 2020.[1][3]

## Fun Facts
- Scaggs traveled to San Francisco via India and Nepal in 1967 after receiving a postcard invitation from Steve Miller to join his band, demonstrating the informal nature of musical connections in that era.[2]
- The album Silk Degrees was so influential that it directly led to the formation of Toto; band members Dennis Paich and Steve Porcaro were touring with Scaggs when they solidified their plan to start their own band, which Columbia Records then signed without requiring an audition.[1][3]
- Scaggs opened and owned the San Francisco nightclub Slim's in 1988, which became a popular music venue and remained operational until 2020, demonstrating his impact beyond recording and touring.[3]
- Despite receiving good reviews for his early solo work, Scaggs did not achieve major commercial success until his 1976 album Silk Degrees, which peaked at number 2 on the Billboard 200—a breakthrough that came seven years after launching his solo career in 1969.[1][3]
