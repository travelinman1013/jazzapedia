## Biography
Baby Rose, born Jasmine Rose Wilson, is an American singer, songwriter, and producer from Washington, D.C.[2] Growing up in the nation's capital, she first discovered the power of her voice by reading aloud original poems at family gatherings.[2] Despite being bullied throughout her childhood and teenage years for her distinctive lower vocal register, she found solace in songwriting and piano, drawing inspiration from legendary vocalists with unique voices such as Nina Simone, Billie Holiday, and Janis Joplin.[2] She moved to Fayetteville, North Carolina for middle and high school before relocating to Atlanta for college in 2013, where she became deeply immersed in the city's vibrant music scene.[2]

Baby Rose's breakthrough came with the release of her seminal projects *From Dusk Til Dawn* and *To Myself*, which earned early recognition from prominent artists including SZA, J. Cole, James Blake, Kehlani, and LeBron James.[2] Her emotionally raw and universally relatable songwriting on *To Myself* garnered critical acclaim from major publications including The New York Times, Pitchfork, Vogue, NPR, Rolling Stone, and Billboard.[2] She made her late-night television debut performing her breakout song "Show You" on *The Late Show with Stephen Colbert* in late 2020 and was featured on J. Cole's Dreamville compilation *Revenge of the Dreamers III*.[2] Her music has been featured on HBO's *Insecure* and Kenya Barris' award-winning series *Grownish*.[2]

As of 2024, Baby Rose is signed with Secretly Canadian and Island Records.[1] Her recent album *Slow Burn*, produced in collaboration with BADBADNOTGOOD, showcases her evolution as an artist, blending progressive R&B with rawer, more expansive American music influences including Muscle Shoals soul, psychedelia, jazz, and Americana.[3] The album was inspired by her experiences driving between her family homes in Washington, D.C. and rural North Carolina, with songs exploring themes of lost friendships, memory, and self-discovery.[3] Baby Rose is recognized as a "once-in-ten-lifetimes vocalist" and formidable songwriter who creates healing music characterized by piercing honesty, vulnerability, and a determination to live and create on her own terms.[2][3]
