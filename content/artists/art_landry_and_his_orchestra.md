## Biography
Art Landry (1896-1990) was a Canadian-born musician and bandleader from Montréal, Quebec, who rose to prominence in the United States during the 1920s jazz and dance band era. A multi-instrumentalist proficient on alto saxophone, clarinet, and violin, Landry formed Art Landry and His Orchestra, a jazzy dance band that recorded prolifically between 1924 and 1927 for labels including Victor and Gennett. His group's style blended ragtime, syncopated rhythms, and hot jazz elements, as heard in tracks like 'I Don’t Mind Being All Alone' (Victor 20337-B, 1926) with vocalist Al Marineau, featuring sudden arrangement shifts and brief hot passages that added intrigue to their pleasant dance-oriented sound.[1][5][6]
