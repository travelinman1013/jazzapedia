## Biography
Ubirajara Guimarães Almeida, known as Mestre Acordeon, was born in 1943 in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil, and is recognized as one of the few officially graduated masters of capoeira from the legendary school of Mestre Bimba. Beginning his capoeira training in 1958, Acordeon quickly established himself as both a martial artist and cultural ambassador. In 1959, he opened his first academy in Boa Vista de Brotas, attracting students seeking a holistic approach to capoeira that combined rigorous physical training with music and artistic expression. His reputation grew substantially throughout the 1960s and 1970s, culminating in winning three Brazilian National Capoeira Championships during the 1970s. In 1966, he founded the Grupo Folclorico da Bahia, one of the first groups to perform capoeira in theatrical shows, including the influential production "Vem Camará: Histórias de Capoeira" at Teatro Jovem in Rio de Janeiro, which shaped the modern capoeira regional movement.

In 1978, Mestre Acordeon relocated to the United States and became a pioneering figure in introducing capoeira to the West Coast, particularly the San Francisco Bay Area. For over four decades, he served as a guiding force for generations of capoeira practitioners, establishing multiple schools and becoming the first artist to receive the Tinker Visiting Professorship at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1994. In 1998, he co-founded the Capoeira Arts Café in downtown Berkeley with Mestre Rã. Beyond his martial arts contributions, Acordeon is an accomplished musician and composer who has recorded multiple capoeira music albums and authored several books, including "Capoeira: A Brazilian Art Form," one of the few comprehensive capoeira texts in English. His cultural impact was formally recognized in 2008 when the City of Berkeley proclaimed October 18 as Mestre Acordeon Day in recognition of his thirty years of continuous work on the West Coast.
