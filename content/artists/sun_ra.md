## Biography
Sun Ra, born Herman Poole Blount on May 22, 1914, in Birmingham, Alabama, displayed prodigious musical talent from a young age, performing his first professional gig in high school with the Sax-O-Society Orchestra and later touring with groups like the Troubadours and the Ethel Harper Band under bandleader John T. 'Fess' Whatley. After moving to Chicago in the 1940s, he worked as a sideman in various styles including boogie-woogie and bebop, making his first commercial recordings in 1946, before legally changing his name to Le Sony'r Ra in 1952 and forming the Space Trio, which evolved into the Sun Ra Arkestra known for its experimental structures, electronic instruments, and elaborate theatrical performances blending jazz, dance, poetry, and cosmic philosophy.

Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, Sun Ra pioneered avant-garde jazz in Chicago, releasing recordings on his own Saturn Records label as one of the first self-produced jazz artists, incorporating electric pianos, synthesizers, clavioline, and extensive percussion as early as 1956. The Arkestra relocated to New York around 1960-1961, establishing a communal Sun Palace and residencies like Slug's nightclub, fully embracing free jazz with albums like *The Magic City* (1965/66), while drawing from ragtime to fusion and emphasizing African origins of jazz and Afrofuturism. He led big bands of up to 30 musicians, innovating with modal jazz, group improvisations, two double basses, electric bass, and polyrhythms, producing over 100 albums and 1,000 songs despite limited mainstream success.

Sun Ra's legacy endures through the Arkestra, which continues performing under Marshall Allen, influencing Afrofuturism and generations of musicians with his prolific output, mystical persona denying his earthly past, and multi-disciplinary art until his death on May 30, 1993, in Birmingham, Alabama.
