## Biography
Josh Kagler, born December 5, 1986, is a musician associated with the New Orleans-based jazz funk band Naughty Professor, where he is listed as a key member on their official website. Limited public information is available on his early life beyond his birthplace in the New Orleans area, but he has been involved in the local music scene, contributing to projects featuring collaborations with artists such as Marcus King, Tarriona 'Tank' Ball, and Maggie Koerner. Kagler previously worked as a teacher at New Orleans-area schools including George Washington Carver, McDonough 35, and Warren Easton High Schools.[1][3]

In July 2025, Kagler was arrested by the New Orleans Police Department on multiple felony charges related to the sexual exploitation of minors, including five counts of trafficking of children for sexual purposes, five counts of indecent behavior with juveniles, one count of third-degree rape, and one count of sexual battery. The investigation by NOPD's Special Victims Division's Child Abuse Cold Case Unit identified him as the alleged perpetrator in crimes involving juveniles. He is presumed innocent until proven guilty, and the investigation remains ongoing.[1][3]

Kagler's musical style aligns with jazz funk as per Spotify data, though comprehensive details on his career development, specific contributions, or legacy are not well-documented in available credible sources due to the recent legal developments overshadowing his professional profile.
