# Quentin Angus Quintet

## Biography
Quentin Angus is an Australian jazz guitarist and composer who was born in Eden Valley, a small South Australian country town with a population of only 200.[1][2] He began his musical journey inspired by Australian guitarist Tommy Emmanuel and developed his core musicianship through his entire childhood and education in Australia, including earning a Bachelor of Music Degree (Jazz Performance).[1][2] In 2010, at age 24, Angus relocated to New York City to pursue advanced studies, earning a Master of Music Degree (Jazz Performance) from SUNY Purchase College under the tutelage of jazz great John Abercrombie, awarded 'Summa Cum Laude', and subsequently completing a PhD in "Phrasing and Polyrhythm in Contemporary Jazz Guitar" with a Dean's Commendation.[1][2][4]

Since establishing himself in New York, Angus has achieved significant national and international recognition as both a performer and composer.[1][2] He is an Associate Professor of Music and program coordinator of jazz and popular music at the Borough of Manhattan Community College, City University of New York, a position he assumed in 2018.[3][4] His accolades include an APRA Art Music Award for 'Excellence in Jazz' (2012), three ASCAP 'Young Jazz Composer Awards' (2012/2013/2015), five Downbeat Magazine Awards in the 'Composition' and 'Soloist' categories (2011/2012/2014), and the Channel 9 'Young Achiever of the Year' award in the Arts Category (2013).[1][2][4] Critics have described him as the "Lord of the strings," "The Future of Jazz Composition," and "A Force on the Scene in New York."[1][2][4]

Angus has performed and recorded extensively throughout the world, appearing at prestigious festivals including the Montreux International Jazz Festival (Switzerland), Melbourne International Jazz Festival (Australia), and Jazz Hoeilaart Festival (Belgium), with performances across Holland, Belgium, Romania, Switzerland, Turkey, New Zealand, Australia, and the United States.[1][2][4] He has released four critically acclaimed albums as a band leader, including 'In Stride' (2018) and 'The State of Things' (2022).[4] Beyond his performance career, Angus is an accomplished academic researcher and content creator, having published research in journals and books, presented at international music conferences, and worked with major record labels including Universal, Impulse, and Verve Records.[1][4]
