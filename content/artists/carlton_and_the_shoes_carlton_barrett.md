## Biography
Carlton 'Carly' Barrett (17 December 1950 – 17 April 1987) was born in Kingston, Jamaica, the second son of Wilfred and Violet Barrett. As a teenager, he constructed his first drum set from empty paint cans found on the street and was heavily influenced by the ska drumming of Lloyd Knibb from the Skatalites. Working as a welder, Barrett initially experimented with guitar before focusing on drums, beginning to perform in the 1960s alongside his brother Aston 'Family Man' Barrett in groups such as The Soul Mates, The Rhythm Force, and The Hippy Boys, which featured Max Romeo on vocals and became a prolific session band backing artists like Slim Smith and recording hits like 'Liquidator' and 'Return of Django'.[2][3]

In the late 1960s, the Barrett brothers joined Lee 'Scratch' Perry's house band, The Upsetters, where they first collaborated with Bob Marley, Peter Tosh, and Bunny Wailer, contributing to Wailers singles like 'Duppy Conqueror' and albums such as *Soul Rebels* and *Soul Revolution*. By 1970, they became permanent members of Bob Marley and the Wailers, forming the band's signature rhythm section. Barrett popularized the 'one-drop' rhythm—a syncopated style emphasizing the third beat with minimal kick drum—featured on classics like 'No Woman, No Cry', 'Jamming', and 'Exodus'. His innovative hi-hat triplets, punchy snares, and subtle grooves defined reggae's golden era, while he co-wrote tracks like 'Talkin' Blues', 'Them Belly Full', and 'War'.[1][2][3]

Barrett continued session work for artists including Bunny Wailer (*Blackheart Man*), Peter Tosh (*Legalize It*, *Equal Rights*), and Augustus Pablo (*King Tubby's Meets Rockers Uptown*). Tragically murdered outside his home in Jamaica on 17 April 1987, Barrett's understated yet dynamic style, using Ludwig kits and a signature Supraphonic snare tuned high with disengaged wires for a timbale-like crack, left an enduring legacy as one of reggae's most influential drummers, shaping roots reggae, dub, and global percussion.[1][2][3]
