## Biography
Marlene Dietrich, born Marie Magdalene Dietrich on December 27, 1901, in Berlin, Germany, grew up in a middle-class family and initially pursued music, studying violin with aspirations of becoming a concert violinist. A wrist injury ended those dreams, leading her to theater and acting; she trained at Max Reinhardt's drama school in 1921, performed as a chorus girl in vaudeville and revues, and debuted in silent films like *The Little Napoleon* (1923). She married Rudolf Sieber in 1923, with whom she had a daughter, Maria, in 1924, though they separated in 1929 without divorcing.[1][2][3][4]

Dietrich's breakthrough came in 1930 as the seductive cabaret singer Lola Lola in Josef von Sternberg's *The Blue Angel*, introducing her signature song 'Falling in Love Again (Can't Help It)' and launching her to international fame. She moved to Hollywood, signing with Paramount Pictures, and starred in six films directed by Sternberg, including *Morocco* (1930, her sole Oscar nomination), *Shanghai Express* (1932), and *The Scarlet Empress* (1934), cultivating a glamorous femme fatale persona marked by androgynous style and contralto vocals. Later, she transitioned to cabaret, refining her act with arranger Burt Bacharach in the 1950s-1960s, performing worldwide until a 1975 stage fall ended her career.[1][2][4]

Dietrich's legacy endures as a style icon and boundary-pusher, rejecting Nazi overtures during World War II to entertain Allied troops, becoming a U.S. citizen in 1937, and influencing fashion and queer culture with her tuxedo-clad performances. She retired to Paris, making a final film appearance in *Just a Gigolo* (1978), and died there on May 6, 1992.[1][3][4]

## Fun Facts
- Dietrich kissed a woman on the lips in *Morocco* (1930), one of Hollywood's earliest on-screen same-sex kisses, while performing in a tuxedo and top hat.
- She turned down massive offers from the Nazis to return to Germany, instead selling bonds and entertaining Allied troops during WWII, becoming a symbol of resistance.
- A wrist injury from playing violin ended her musical ambitions, leading her to pit orchestras and then acting; she was fired after four weeks from her first job.
- Dietrich was one of the highest-paid stars of her era, earning $450,000 for *Knight Without Armour* (1937), equivalent to millions today.
