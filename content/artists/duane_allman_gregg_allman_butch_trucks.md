## Biography
Duane Allman (born November 20, 1946, in Nashville, TN) and younger brother Gregg Allman (born December 8, 1947, in Nashville, TN) grew up after their father's murder, raised by their single mother Geraldine, frequently moving including to Florida. They began playing music together in bands like the Allman Joys and 31st of February, which included drummer Butch Trucks (born Claude Hudson Trucks, May 11, 1947). Duane became a renowned session guitarist at FAME Studios in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, working with artists like Wilson Pickett, Aretha Franklin, and King Curtis, while Gregg recorded unsuccessfully in Los Angeles. In 1969, Duane assembled the Allman Brothers Band in Jacksonville, Florida, recruiting Gregg (vocals, organ), Dickey Betts (guitar), Berry Oakley (bass), Butch Trucks (drums), and Jai Johanny 'Jaimoe' Johanson (drums), pioneering a sound blending southern rock, blues, jazz improvisation, and dual lead guitars/drums.[1][2][3][5][6]

The band's breakthrough came with their 1971 live album At Fillmore East, but tragedy struck when Duane died in a motorcycle accident on October 29, 1971, followed by bassist Oakley in 1972. Despite losses, the band continued, achieving success with Eat a Peach and later reunions, incorporating southern rock, blues rock, and jam elements. Butch Trucks' powerful drumming complemented Jaimoe's jazz style, forming the core rhythm section. The Allman Brothers Band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995, influencing jam bands and southern rock.[1][3][6]

Butch Trucks passed away on January 24, 2017. The trio's collaboration defined the band's legacy of extended jams and raw energy, with Gregg leading through lineup changes until his death in 2017.
