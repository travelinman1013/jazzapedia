## Biography
James Ingram was an American R&B singer, songwriter, and musician born on February 16, 1952, in Akron, Ohio, to Alistine and Henry Ingram.[1][3] Largely self‑taught and initially inspired by jazz organist Jimmy Smith, he began playing music at an early age and came up through the local Akron scene with the funk band Revelation Funk, which opened for the Ohio Players and worked alongside other regional funk outfits.[1][3] In the early 1970s he moved with his band to Los Angeles, but when the group dissolved, Ingram stayed behind, supporting himself as a keyboardist and backup vocalist, including work with Ray Charles and live and studio gigs that built his reputation as a versatile session musician.[1][2][3]

Ingram’s breakthrough came when producer Quincy Jones heard his demo performance of “Just Once” and invited him to sing on three tracks on Jones’s 1981 album *The Dude*: “Just Once,” “The Dude,” and “One Hundred Ways.”[1][2][3] “One Hundred Ways” earned Ingram a Grammy Award for best R&B vocal performance before he had even released a solo album, and he also garnered nominations for Best New Artist and Best Pop Male Vocal.[2][3] Signed to Jones’s Qwest label, he issued his debut solo album *It’s Your Night* in 1983, which went gold and included the Grammy‑winning duet “Yah Mo B There” with Michael McDonald.[1][2][3] Through the 1980s and early 1990s he became known for sophisticated pop and R&B ballads and high‑profile collaborations, co‑writing Michael Jackson’s hit “P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing),” singing the Oscar‑nominated and Grammy‑winning duet “Somewhere Out There” with Linda Ronstadt from *An American Tail*, and later scoring a No. 1 hit with “I Don’t Have the Heart” from his album *It’s Real*.[1][3]

Over the course of a career that brought him multiple Grammy Awards, numerous nominations, and two Academy Award nominations for best original song, Ingram cultivated a style rooted in gospel‑trained baritone warmth, smooth R&B phrasing, and pop‑oriented songwriting.[2][3] After releases such as *Never Felt So Good*, *It’s Real*, and the greatest‑hits set *The Power of Great Music*, he eventually turned toward inspirational material with the 2008 gospel album *Stand (In the Light)* while continuing to tour internationally into the 2010s.[1][3] Ingram died in Los Angeles on January 29, 2019, from brain cancer, leaving a legacy as one of the defining R&B vocalists and collaborators of the 1980s and 1990s whose voice and songs were closely associated with Quincy Jones’s productions and mainstream adult contemporary radio.[3]

## Fun Facts
- Ingram won his first Grammy Award for “One Hundred Ways” before he had even released a solo album, thanks to his featured vocals on Quincy Jones’s album *The Dude*.[2][3]
- His first live performance as a lead singer was on the Grammy Awards telecast, where he opened the show with “Just Once” and went on to win a Grammy without yet having an album of his own in stores.[2]
- Before breaking through as a vocalist, Ingram seriously pursued music as a keyboardist and musical director, working behind the scenes for artists like Leon Haywood and backing iconic acts such as Ray Charles and the Coasters.[1][2]
- Ingram’s career bridged pop, R&B, film music, and gospel: he co‑wrote a track on Michael Jackson’s *Thriller*, sang an Oscar‑nominated movie duet (“Somewhere Out There”), and later returned to his roots with the 2008 gospel album *Stand (In the Light).*[1][3]
