## Biography
Eddy Senay was born in Lanett, Alabama, and raised by his grandmother. His early musical influences included Little Richard, who lived nearby, and Sam Cooke, whom he witnessed practicing on Saturday mornings; his father was friends with Otis Redding. At age 6, he crafted his own guitar from a cigar box, fish string, nails, and wood. At 14, he moved to Detroit, attending Northern High School with classmates like Melvin Franklin of the Temptations and drummer Kenneth 'Spider Webb' Rice.[1]

By age 28, Senay secured a recording contract with L.A.-based Sussex Records, releasing his debut album *Hot Thang* in 1972, followed by *Step By Step*. These albums featured soulful, imaginative jazz-funk instrumentals with psychedelic guitar-powered funk, including tracks like the oft-sampled 'Zambezi' and a cover of 'Ain’t No Sunshine.' His style blended soul jazz, jazz funk, and blaxploitation-inspired grooves, though they gained limited commercial success at the time.[1][2]

Despite not becoming a household name, Senay's music has been rediscovered by new generations through online platforms and vinyl reissues. He continues to write, record, and perform music.[1]
