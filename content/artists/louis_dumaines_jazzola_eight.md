## Biography
Louis Dumaine's Jazzola Eight was a prominent New Orleans jazz ensemble led by cornetist and bandleader Louis Dumaine (1889-1949), active in the 1920s during the golden era of traditional jazz and ragtime. Dumaine, who served as a bugle boy in the U.S. Army during World War I, emerged as a key figure in the city's brass and marching band scene before forming the Jazzola Eight. The group exemplified authentic New Orleans jazz with its driving ensemble work, spirited solos, and blues-inflected ragtime style, capturing the raw energy of the era's street parades and dance halls.[1][2][3][4]

In March 1927, Victor Recording Company traveled to New Orleans to record the band, producing five tracks: 'Franklin Street Blues' (composed by Louis Dumaine and Eddie Jackson), 'Red Onion Drag' (Dumaine and Eddie Jackson), 'Pretty Audrey' (Dumaine and Morris Rouse), 'To-Wa-Bac-A-Wa' (Dumaine and Eddie Jackson, an early version of 'The Bucket's Got a Hole in It'), and a folk tune. These recordings, featuring Dumaine's mellow cornet leadership, clarinet fluidity, and tight teamwork, remain celebrated historical documents of 1920s New Orleans jazz, influencing traditional jazz revivalists.[3][4][7][8]

Dumaine led various brass bands alongside the Jazzola Eight until his death in 1949. The group's legacy endures through these rare Victor sides, preserved on compilations like 'The Very Best Of' and 'Really The Blues?: A Blues History,' highlighting their role in preserving the unpretentious, collective polyphony of early jazz.[3][5]
