## Biography
Bob Weir (born Robert Hall Parber, October 16, 1947 – January 10, 2026) was an American musician and songwriter best known as a founding member of the Grateful Dead. At age 16, he began his musical journey in 1963, joining Jerry Garcia in 1964 to form Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions, which evolved into the Warlocks and then the Grateful Dead by 1965. The youngest member at 17, Weir played rhythm guitar and emerged as co-lead vocalist and key songwriter, partnering with lyricist John Perry Barlow on classics like 'Cassidy,' 'Estimated Prophet,' and 'Throwing Stones,' while staples such as 'Sugar Magnolia,' 'Playing in the Band,' and 'The Other One' defined the band's live sets. His style blended rock & roll, country & western, blues, psychedelia, folk, and country, shaping the jam band genre.[1][2][3]

Throughout the Grateful Dead's 30-year run until Jerry Garcia's death in 1995, Weir was a rhythmic anchor and innovator, briefly fired in 1967 for needing to improve but quickly rebounding. Post-Dead, he led side projects like Kingfish (1975-1976), Bob Weir Band (1978), Bobby and the Midnites (1980), RatDog (mid-1990s), and co-led Furthur with Phil Lesh. In 2015, he co-founded Dead & Company with Mickey Hart, Bill Kreutzmann, John Mayer, and others, performing over 350 shows. Weir received Kennedy Center Honors in 2024 and MusiCares Person of the Year in 2025 with the Dead, passing at 78 after battling cancer.[2][3][4][5]

Weir's legacy as a distinctive rhythm guitarist and steward of the Grateful Dead's music endures, inspiring generations through fearless improvisation and carrying the band's ethos forward in iconic venues like London's Royal Albert Hall in 2025.
