## Biography
Walter Trout is an American blues guitarist, singer, and songwriter born in 1951 in Ocean City, New Jersey.[1] His musical journey began at age ten when he picked up a guitar, though his initial instrument was trumpet, which he played in his school band.[1][2] A pivotal moment came at his tenth birthday when his mother arranged a meeting with jazz legends Duke Ellington, Cat Anderson, Johnny Hodges, and Paul Gonsalves, planting the seed for a professional music career.[1] In the mid-1960s, after hearing the Paul Butterfield Blues Band featuring Mike Bloomfield, Trout switched to electric guitar and committed himself to the blues genre.[1] As a shy teenager in a turbulent household, guitar became his solace for expressing emotions, and by his late teens and early twenties, he was performing in numerous New Jersey bands, competing for recognition alongside a young Bruce Springsteen's Steel Mill.[1]

In 1973, Trout made the pivotal decision to drive cross-country to Los Angeles with minimal possessions, beginning his apprenticeship as a sideman in California's blues scene.[1] He worked with blues legends including Deacon Jones, John Lee Hooker, Big Mama Thorton, and Joe Tex, establishing himself as a top-flight lead guitarist.[1] From 1981 to 1984, Trout joined the venerable blues-rock band Canned Heat, where he refined his touring abilities and solidified his reputation.[1] He then joined John Mayall's Bluesbreakers in the mid-1980s, where he shared guitar duties with Coco Montoya in what was the only time in Mayall's career that he featured two lead guitarists, lifting the band to unprecedented album sales and high-profile tours.[1][5] By 1989, Trout embarked on a solo career, forming The Walter Trout Band and immediately launching extensive European tours that resulted in radio hits and chart success throughout the 1990s, releasing eight recordings during that decade.[1]

Trout's career has been marked by numerous accolades, including Blues Music Awards, SENA European Guitar Awards, British Blues Awards, and Blues Blast Music Awards.[4] British DJ 'Whispering' Bob Harris declared him "the world's greatest rock guitarist" in his 2001 autobiography.[4] Beyond his musical achievements, Trout faced life-threatening health issues, including a liver transplant, which he overcame to continue performing at the highest level.[3] His distinctive blend of fiery guitar solos, heartfelt lyrics, and emotive vocals has cemented his status as a blues guitar virtuoso and living legend in the blues music landscape.[2][3]

## Fun Facts
- At age 14, while flunking out of school, Trout told his guidance counselor he was going to be a blues guitar player—a commitment he has maintained throughout his life.[5]
- In 1973, Trout drove cross-country to Los Angeles in a VW Beetle with only a few changes of clothes, a trumpet, a mandolin, and his guitars.[1]
- Early in his career, Trout and his bass player in Idaho slept in a dog kennel with individual cages during a road trip because they had no other place to stay.[5]
- After recording the title track for one of his albums, his keys player Teddy Andreadis remarked, 'Well, you won't be winning a blues award this year'—reflecting the album's unusually hard rock sound compared to traditional blues.[4]
