## Biography
The Hawks were a Canadian rock and roll backing band that originated in Toronto, Ontario, forming around 1958 as the supporting ensemble for rockabilly singer Ronnie Hawkins[1]. The group's core lineup—Levon Helm (drums), Robbie Robertson (guitar), Rick Danko (bass), Richard Manuel (keyboards/vocals), and Garth Hudson (organ)—came together gradually between 1957 and late 1961, with each member joining after relocating to Canada or being recruited by Hawkins[1][4]. Under Hawkins' leadership, the Hawks became renowned as the finest rock and roll band in Toronto's thriving music scene, honing their instrumental prowess through intensive all-night rehearsals following lengthy club performances[1]. The band's reputation caught the attention of Bob Dylan, who hired them as his backing band for his U.S. tour in 1965 and world tour in 1966, marking a pivotal moment in rock history as Dylan's first electric band[1]. Following their work with Dylan, the group relocated to Saugerties, New York, where they recorded the influential informal sessions known as The Basement Tapes with Dylan in 1967, ultimately adopting the name "The Band" and releasing their acclaimed 1968 debut album Music from Big Pink[1]. The Hawks' legacy rests on their role as a transitional force in rock music, bridging the gap between American rockabilly and blues traditions and the emerging electric rock sound of the 1960s.

## Fun Facts
- Levon Helm's name was originally pronounced 'Lavon,' but band members had difficulty with the pronunciation, so it morphed into 'Levon,' which stuck permanently[5]
- Garth Hudson negotiated a new Lowery organ as part of his recruitment deal with Ronnie Hawkins in late 1961, and then charged other band members $10 per week for 'music lessons' to justify to his parents that he was still a music consultant rather than a full-time rock musician[5]
- The Hawks set a thousand or more patrons 'on fire nightly' during a four-month stand in Somers Point, New Jersey, performing their blend of blues and R&B before Dylan discovered them[3]
- Rick Danko was only 17 years old when Ronnie Hawkins recruited him in May 1961 after watching him perform at Pop Ivey's Summer Garden Pavilion in Port Dover, Ontario[1]
