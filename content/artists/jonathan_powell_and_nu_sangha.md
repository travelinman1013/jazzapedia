## Biography
Jonathan Powell, born in Largo, Florida, began playing trumpet at age eleven or twelve, inspired by jazz legends like Louis Armstrong, Dizzy Gillespie, Freddie Hubbard, and Miles Davis. In high school, he excelled in the All-State Band and All-State Jazz Band, then studied under Raymond Mase at the North Carolina School of the Arts, where he formed the jazz group Quantum, winning Best Student Jazz Group in the Downbeat Student Awards in 1998 and 1999. After high school, he explored Florida's music scene with groups like Bogus Pomp, SHIM, and Rocksteady @ 8 before moving to New York City in 2001 at age 19, immersing himself in its jazz and Latin scenes.

In New York, Powell gigged with La Creacion, Sam Rivers' Fluid Motion, and built a reputation in Latin jazz, earning Best Latin Jazz Trumpeter from The Latin Jazz Corner in 2007 and 2009. He formed Nu Sangha—meaning 'community' in Tibetan—in the late 2000s, blending jazz with Latin music, North Indian classical, Drum'n'Bass, hip hop, death metal, and 20th-century classical elements. The group released acclaimed albums *Transcend* (2010) and *Beacons of Light* (2015), featuring up-and-coming NYC musicians. Powell also leads Mambo Jazz Party and freelances extensively.

A versatile sideman, Powell has performed with Eddie Palmieri's Latin Jazz Septet and Salsa Orchestra (first-call trumpeter since 2013), Arturo O'Farrill's Afro Latin Jazz Orchestra (contributing to GRAMMY wins in 2014 and 2015), Blood Sweat & Tears, Darcy James Argue's Secret Society, Miguel Zenón, and others. His career reflects a fusion of jazz roots with global influences, establishing him as a dynamic force in NYC's eclectic music landscape.
