## Biography
Mitch Woods is an American boogie-woogie, jump blues, and jazz pianist and singer born on April 3, 1951, in Brooklyn, New York.[2] He began classical piano studies at age eleven and was already forming blues bands around Greenwich Village by his mid-teens.[6] After relocating to the West Coast in the early 1970s, Woods initially performed as a soloist in San Francisco clubs, drawing inspiration from jump blues pioneers like Louis Jordan.[2] In 1980, he formed Mitch Woods and His Rocket 88s, initially inheriting members from the David Bromberg Band.[4] Since the early 1980s, Woods has been touring and recording extensively with the Rocket 88s, establishing himself as a fixture on the Northern California club scene before achieving widespread acclaim at the national and international levels.[2]

Woods' musical style, which he calls "rock-a-boogie," synthesizes multiple American musical traditions including 1940s and 1950s jump blues, Chicago blues, Kansas City boogie-woogie, West Coast jump blues, and New Orleans rhythm and blues.[2] His virtuosity spans four distinct piano styles, and his dynamic performances have earned him recognition as one of the best modern players in traditional musical forms.[3] Over a career spanning more than three decades, Woods has recorded numerous albums and collaborated with blues legends, earning multiple nominations including a 2007 Pinetop Perkins Piano Player of the Year Award nomination at the Blues Awards in Memphis.[2] In 2025, he received nominations for both Pinetop Perkins Piano Player and Traditional Blues Album for his album "Happy Hour" at the Blues Music Awards.[3]

New Orleans has been a major inspiration throughout Woods' career, particularly since attending the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival beginning in 1981.[4] His 2019 album recorded at the festival was nominated for Best Live Blues Recording at the Blues Blast Music Awards.[3] Woods' 2019 release, "A Tip of the Hat to Fats," is a tribute to rock pioneer Fats Domino, reflecting his deep admiration for the New Orleans piano tradition.[6]
