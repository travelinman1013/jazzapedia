## Biography
Florence and the Machine is an English indie rock band formed in London in 2007, fronted by lead vocalist and primary songwriter Florence Welch (born 28 August 1986).[1][5] Welch began her musical journey in her hometown of Blackpool, England, where she sang at local gigs while playing guitar and piano.[3] By age 14, she had moved to New York and was performing in pubs and clubs, later relocating to London where she gained attention after a chance nightclub performance in December 2006 that impressed manager Mairead Nash.[2][3][6] The band's name originated as a playful joke between Welch and her collaborator Isabella Summers, evolving from their initial monikers "Florence Robot" and "Isabella Machine" into the more streamlined Florence + the Machine.[1]

The band achieved rapid commercial and critical success following their formation in 2007 with keyboardist Isabella Summers, guitarist Rob Ackroyd, drummer Christopher Lloyd Hayden, and harpist Tom Monger.[5] Their debut studio album *Lungs* (2009) topped the UK Albums Chart and won the Brit Award for Best British Album, establishing their signature sound as a dramatic blend of baroque pop, rock, and soul.[1][2] Florence and the Machine scored their first U.S. number one with their third album *How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful* in June 2015, followed by continued success with *High As Hope* (2018), which featured the hit single "Hunger."[2] The band's music is characterized by Welch's powerful, distinctive vocals and eccentric, dramatic production, with a fluid lineup of supporting musicians throughout their career.[5][6]

Beyond music, Welch has expanded her creative pursuits into literature and fashion, publishing the book *Useless Magic: Lyrics and Poetry* in 2018 and modeling for prestigious fashion labels including Burberry and Maison Martin Margiela.[2][3] Over the following decade, Florence has won two Brit Awards and six Grammy Awards, earning recognition from Forbes Magazine as one of the top 10 influential women in music.[3] The band made their American television debut on the Late Show with David Letterman on March 6, 2010, marking the beginning of their international prominence.[3]

## Fun Facts
- The band's name originated from a private joke between Florence Welch and Isabella Summers. Welch was called 'Florence Robot' and Summers was 'Isabella Machine,' leading to the initial concept of 'Florence Robot Is A Machine' before being shortened to Florence + the Machine.[1]
- Florence Welch's breakthrough moment came from an impromptu, drunken performance of Etta James's classic 'Something's Got a Hold on Me' in a nightclub restroom in December 2006, which impressed her future manager Mairead Nash so much that it launched her professional career.[2][6]
- Before forming Florence and the Machine, Welch was signed to a band called Ashok but realized she was in the wrong group and successfully extricated herself from the contract to pursue her own musical vision.[6]
- Florence Welch has pursued a parallel career in fashion, modeling for prestigious labels including Burberry and the French fashion house Maison Martin Margiela while maintaining her music career.[3]
