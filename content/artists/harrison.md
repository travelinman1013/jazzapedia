## Biography
DJ Harrison, born Devonne Harris in 1988 in Petersburg, Virginia, grew up immersed in music through his father Lovander Shelton Jr., a radio DJ on Magic 99 FM who exposed him to funk, R&B, and soul, and his music aficionado mother with an extensive vinyl collection. He developed perfect pitch and musical talent early, joining the drumline at Thomas Dale High School in 2002, where band director Jason Morehouse and other instructors nurtured his skills as a multi-instrumentalist. Harrison evolved into a versatile producer and player, blending hip-hop, jazz, R&B, soul, funk, and rock into a unique style of Black American Music, often recording himself playing all instruments or sampling his own chops.[1][4][2]

His career gained momentum as a session musician and band member, including with Butcher Brown—a garage punk jazz funk group—and The Spacebomb House Band, while building a solo catalog on Stones Throw Records with albums like *HazyMoods*, *Tales From The Old Dominion* (2021, inspired by Black Lives Matter protests and Richmond's history), *Shades of Yesterday* (2024, covers of deep cuts from his heroes), and the surprise hit *A DJHarrison Xmas*. A two-time GRAMMY nominee for contributions to Kurt Elling’s albums, he has produced for Phonte, Steve Arrington, Pink Siifu, Joyce Wrice, Jack White, Natalie Prass, and Sherman Holmes, showcasing his genre-blurring prowess.[2][1][4]

Harrison's legacy lies in his homespun, experimental hip-hop and psychedelic funk sound, rooted in self-production and influences from Marvin Gaye, Jimi Hendrix, D’Angelo, P-Funk, and Ohio Players, while pushing boundaries through reel-to-reel recording and multi-tracking techniques honed on childhood karaoke machines. Based in Richmond, Virginia, he continues to innovate, reflecting personal and cultural narratives in his work.[5][2][4]
