Lalah Hathaway (born December 16, 1968) is an American singer-songwriter and music producer credited as the "First Daughter of Soul."[1] Born in Chicago, Illinois, she is the daughter of legendary soul musician Donny Hathaway.[2] She pursued formal education at the Berklee College of Music, where her talent flourished during her high school years.[2] Hathaway recorded her self-titled debut album while still a student at Berklee, which was released in 1990 under Virgin Records.[1][2] The album peaked at number 18 on the US R&B Albums chart, with the lead single "Heaven Knows" reaching the top five on the US Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.[1]

Beyond her musical achievements, Hathaway has demonstrated entrepreneurial vision and social commitment. In 2015, she founded Hathaway Entertainment, her own independent entertainment company, which has distributed her recent albums including *Honestly* (2017) and *VANTABLACK* (2024).[1][5] She received an honorary doctorate from Berklee College of Music in 2022, recognizing her contributions to music.[1] Hathaway has also been active in philanthropy, serving as a national ambassador for Susan G.
