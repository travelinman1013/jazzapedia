## Biography
Henry 'Hank' Mobley, born on July 7, 1930, in Eastman, Georgia, and raised primarily in Elizabeth, New Jersey, began playing tenor saxophone as a teenager, inspired by family musicians who played piano and church organ, as well as jazz icons like Lester Young and Charlie Parker. Overcoming a childhood ailment that kept him housebound, he started his professional career in the late 1940s, joining Paul Gayten’s R&B band in 1949 on Clifford Brown’s recommendation, then moving to Max Roach (1951-1953), Dizzy Gillespie (1954), and briefly Duke Ellington in 1953. In 1954, he joined Horace Silver’s group, which evolved into the original Jazz Messengers with Art Blakey, helping pioneer hard bop through their landmark 1955 Blue Note album.[1][2][3][4][7]

Mobley’s career peaked in the late 1950s and early 1960s as a Blue Note leader, recording classics like Soul Station (1960), Roll Call (1960), Workout (1961), No Room for Squares (1963), and A Caddy for Daddy (1965), noted for his melodic fluency, round buttery tone, intricate rhythmic precision, and sophisticated yet soulful hard bop style blending bebop complexity with earthy swing. He briefly replaced John Coltrane in Miles Davis’ quintet (1961-1962), contributing to Someday My Prince Will Come and Blackhawk live albums, though the fit was stormy. Drug issues interrupted his career multiple times, including incarcerations in the late 1950s and 1964, but he persisted with freelance work in the U.S. and Europe into the 1970s.[1][2][3][5]

Health declined due to drug and alcohol abuse, losing a lung, limiting performances after the early 1970s; his final recording was in 1980 with Tete Montoliu. Mobley died penniless and homeless on May 30, 1986, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, after missing a scheduled appearance at the 1985 Blue Note relaunch. Dubbed the 'middleweight champion' of the tenor saxophone by Leonard Feather, his legacy endures as a musicians’ musician whose imaginative compositions and impeccable interplay defined hard bop.[1][2][3]
