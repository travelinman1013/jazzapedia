# Little Benny & The Masters

## Biography
Little Benny & the Masters were a Washington, D.C.–based go-go band led by trumpeter and vocalist Benny Anthony Harley, better known as **Little Benny**.[1][2] Formed in the mid‑1980s while Harley was emerging from his key role in Rare Essence, one of D.C.’s most influential go-go groups, the band crystallized the hyper-local party sound of Washington into songs that briefly crossed over to international audiences. Their breakout single, “Who Comes to Boogie,” released in 1984, became a club favorite and reached No. 33 on the UK Singles Chart in February 1985, giving go-go a rare mainstream foothold outside its home city.[1][2] Building on Harley’s raucous call‑and‑response vocals, percussive grooves, and punchy horn lines, Little Benny & the Masters quickly became a staple of the mid‑’80s D.C. go-go circuit.

The group’s debut album *Cat in the Hat* appeared in 1987, followed by the live set *Little Benny Gettin' Funky Up In Here* (1991), *Little Benny Take Me Out To The Go-Go Live* (1992), the studio album *Gett Your Drink On* (1997), and *Live at the Cafe* (2000), reflecting go-go’s emphasis on extended, groove‑driven performances documented in both studio and club settings.[1][2] Although the band went through numerous lineup changes over the years, Harley’s energetic stage presence, powerful vocal style, and distinctive trumpet work—including a much‑noted ability to play two trumpets at once—remained its defining features.[2] Within the broader history of go-go, Harley is frequently cited as one of the genre’s foundational figures, expanding the sound pioneered by Chuck Brown and Rare Essence while helping to carry D.C.’s homegrown party music onto international dance floors.[2][7] The enduring popularity of “Who Comes to Boogie” on compilations and in DJ sets, alongside the band’s influential live recordings, has secured Little Benny & the Masters a lasting legacy as one of go-go’s signature outfits.

Beyond charts and discography, the band’s legacy is tightly woven into Washington’s cultural fabric. Go-go historians and local chroniclers often single out Little Benny as part of the core pantheon that shaped the music’s golden era, crediting his work in Rare Essence and with the Masters as central to the genre’s evolution from neighborhood parties to a fully formed regional culture.[2][7] Harley’s later reunions with Rare Essence and his frequent performances with Chuck Brown in the years before his death in 2010 further reinforced his status as a bridge between go-go’s early innovators and subsequent generations of musicians and fans.[2][7] In this context, Little Benny & the Masters are remembered less as a conventional chart act and more as a crucial live band whose recordings capture the communal, percussive, and improvisatory spirit that defines Washington, D.C. go-go.
  

## Fun Facts
- Little Benny & the Masters scored a surprise international success when their single “Who Comes to Boogie” reached No. 33 on the UK Singles Chart in February 1985, a rare overseas chart appearance for a D.C. go-go act.[1][2]
- Anthony “Little Benny” Harley first joined Rare Essence when the band was still known as The Young Dynamos, long before he broke out with Little Benny & the Masters.[2]
- Harley became locally famous for his high‑energy stage presence and a party trick of playing two trumpets at once during performances.[2]
- The band’s discography is unusually weighted toward live recordings—such as *Little Benny Gettin’ Funky Up In Here* and *Live at the Cafe*—which reflects go-go’s identity as a live, dance‑floor‑driven genre rather than a studio‑singles format.[1][2]
