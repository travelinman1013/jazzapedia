## Biography
Kenny Barron, born Kenneth Barron on June 9, 1943, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, began playing piano at age 12 with encouragement from Ray Bryant's sister and started his professional career as a teenager with Mel Melvin's orchestra, which featured his brother Bill on tenor saxophone, and drummer Philly Joe Jones while still in high school[1][2][4]. At 19, he moved to New York City in 1961-1962, freelancing with Roy Haynes, Lee Morgan, and James Moody after Moody heard him at the Five Spot, leading to his hiring by Dizzy Gillespie on Moody's recommendation, where he developed an appreciation for Latin and Caribbean rhythms[1][2][3][5]. Encouraged by Yusef Lateef, Barron pursued education, earning a B.A. in Music from Empire State College while touring, and joined Rutgers University faculty in 1973, teaching until 2000[1][2].

Barron's career spans over 40 albums as a leader and hundreds as a sideman, marking his debut recording as composer/arranger on Lateef's 'The Centaur and the Phoenix' (1960) and as performer in New York with his brother, Ted Curson, and Booker Ervin[1][2][4]. In 1974, he released his first leader album 'Sunset to Dawn' on Muse, co-founded Sphere in 1982 with Buster Williams, Ben Riley, and Charlie Rouse to honor Thelonious Monk, and collaborated extensively in the 1980s with Stan Getz on albums like 'Anniversary,' 'Serenity,' and the Grammy-nominated 'People Time'[2][3][6][7]. His style blends bebop, hard bop, cool jazz, and jazz ballads, showcasing mastery in solo, trio, and larger formats with elegant playing, sensitive melodies, and infectious rhythms[1][6].

Barron's legacy includes 14 Grammy nominations for albums like 'Spirit Song,' 'Sambao,' 'Night and the City' with Charlie Haden, and 'Wanton Spirit' with Roy Haynes and Haden; induction into the American Jazz Hall of Fame (2005); Living Legacy Award (2009); seven-time Jazz Journalists Association Best Pianist winner; and mentorship of talents like David Sanchez, Terence Blanchard, and Regina Bell[1][2][3]. He received honorary doctorates from Berklee (2010) and SUNY Empire State (2013), and continues touring internationally as a NEA Jazz Master[2][3][7].
