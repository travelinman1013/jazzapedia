## Biography
Johnny Pacheco (March 25, 1935 – February 15, 2021) was a Dominican-born musician, arranger, composer, bandleader, and record producer who became a seminal figure in the New York salsa scene. Born in Santiago de los Caballeros, Dominican Republic, Pacheco grew up immersed in merengue through his mother's love of Dominican music and his father Rafael Azarias Pacheco's passion for Cuban danzón and clarinet. He began his musical journey at age seven, playing harmonica and merengue, before relocating to Santo Domingo where he absorbed Cuban music through radio broadcasts. In the 1950s, Pacheco moved to New York and quickly established himself as a versatile percussionist and multi-instrumentalist, playing with orchestras led by Tito Puente, Xavier Cugat, and others, while also studying classical percussion at Juilliard School under Morris Goldberg.

Pacheco's most transformative contribution came through his co-founding of Fania Records in late 1963 with lawyer Jerry Masucci. As Vice President, A&R creative director, and musical producer, Pacheco revolutionized Latin music by popularizing the term "salsa" and establishing the Fania All-Stars, which showcased leading artists of the genre and propelled him to worldwide fame. In 1964, frustrated with finding reliable violinists, he transitioned from the charanga sound to a two-trumpet conjunto style, a shift musicologists termed "la matancerización de la salsa." His production work revitalized Celia Cruz's career with the megahit album *Celia and Johnny* (1974), and he produced and oversaw hundreds of releases that earned Fania Records the nickname "the Motown of Salsa." Pacheco was a nine-time Grammy nominee and received the Latin Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2005, cementing his legacy as a pioneer who blended Cuban, Puerto Rican, and Dominican musical traditions to define the salsa genre.

## Fun Facts
- Pacheco received his first musical instrument—a harmonica—as a Three Kings Day gift at age seven and immediately learned to play 'Compadre Pedro Juan,' a merengue composed by Luis Alberti.
- He abandoned his engineering career after a friend offered him $95 plus room and board to play music for a weekend in Villa Perez, a decision that launched his legendary music career.
- By 1958, Pacheco had become so skilled at sight-reading percussion that he became a go-to studio musician in New York City and a staff musician at NBC, frequently called for the Tonight Show Orchestra.
- Pacheco named Fania Records after the song 'Fanía' by Reinaldo Bolaños, made famous by Estrellas de Chocolate in Cuba in 1960, rather than using a completely original name.
