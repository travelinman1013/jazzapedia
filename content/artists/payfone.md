# Payfone

## Biography
Payfone is an electronic music duo formed in 2013 by multi-instrumentalist Phil Passera and keys player Jimmy Day, initially based in East London, with Passera later relocating to Barcelona while Day remains in Brighton.[1][2][3] Phil Passera, born and raised in London to an Italian father and Welsh mother, began his musical journey in the 1990s as a saxophonist for six years before switching to bass and forming the indie punk band MEAT, influenced by My Bloody Valentine, Pixies, and The Wedding Present; he started DJing through his older brother and producing records in 1998 as part of Kitty Bronx.[1][5] Payfone emerged from a remix project Passera and Day undertook together for Black Devil Disco Club under Passera's alias Leon Lace, leading to their debut track 'International Smark' in 2013, followed by 'Paradise' on Golf Channel, which gradually built a dedicated audience despite lacking immediate hits.[1][4]

The duo's sound fuses disco-leaning electronic grooves with warm-blooded soul, synthetic boogie, and artsy electronica, characterized by analogue recording on tape, classic drum machines, JUNO-60 synthesizers, and a mix of upbeat, downtempo, and lyrical tracks that balance machine-fuelled precision with organic feel.[1][2][3][6][9] Passera handles primary songwriting, while Day excels in studio production; after initial solo efforts by Passera, they reunited fully around the time of their album 'Sofian,' maintaining consistent output including a 10-year compilation, singles on Passera's Otis label, and projects like 'Lunch / Otis' that have amassed millions of streams.[1] Live performances feature Passera with rotating musicians, such as vocalist April Pittmann from Brooklyn and bassist Joseph Gabriel Harris from North Carolina.[1]

Over a decade, Payfone has cultivated a maturing appeal through patient releases that prioritize freshness over trends, earning a large, loyal following for tracks evoking instinctive emotional resonance, with recent works like 'Sofian' blending slinky grooves and Moroder-styled synths.[1][6]

## Fun Facts
- Payfone's breakthrough track 'International Smark' was initially overlooked but gained a dedicated fanbase over time, exemplifying their philosophy of creating fresh music rather than chasing trends.[1]
- Phil Passera sold his saxophone after six years to buy a bass guitar and immediately formed the indie punk band MEAT.[1]
- The duo records entirely in analogue fashion on tape due to geographical separation, with Jimmy Day handling studio production in Brighton.[1]
- Passera avoids playing Payfone tracks in his DJ sets to prevent feeling 'cheesy,' preferring live shows for that indulgence.[1]
