## Biography
José Gonzaga Ferreira, better known as Carlos Gonzaga, was born on February 10, 1924, in Paraisópolis, Minas Gerais, Brazil.[1] He grew up in a modest environment, initially working as a porter at the local train station before seeking better opportunities in larger cities during the late 1940s. After relocating to São Paulo, he settled in the Cambuci region and worked in a furniture manufacturing company while pursuing music as an amateur performer. His vocal talent impressed colleagues and acquaintances, leading to regular performances on freshman programs where he won multiple competitions.[1]

Gonzaga's professional breakthrough came in the late 1950s when he became Brazil's most popular rock and roll singer of the early rock era (1958–1963).[2] His 1958 recording of "Diana," a Brazilian cover of Paul Anka's Canadian hit, catapulted him to national success and marked his transition from guarânia and semi-sertanejo music to rock and ballad-rock.[1][2] He achieved a string of number-one hits throughout 1958–1961, including "Oh Carol" (1959), "Bat Masterson" (1960), and "Cavaleiros do Céu" (1961).[2] Despite his commercial dominance and recognition as the "King of Ballad-Rock" by industry publications, Gonzaga was notably denied the broader "King of Rock" title, which was instead awarded to younger white singers such as Sergio Murilo and Ronnie Cord.[2] He continued recording prolifically across multiple record labels including RCA Victor, Philips, and others, maintaining an active career for decades. Gonzaga died on August 25, 2023, at the age of 99 in Velletri, Italy.[1]

## Fun Facts
- Despite achieving massive commercial success with multiple number-one hits in the late 1950s and early 1960s, Carlos Gonzaga was systematically denied the prestigious title of 'King of Rock' due to racial discrimination and his age (he was already in his thirties when he achieved rock stardom), with the crown instead given to younger white singers.[2]
- Gonzaga experienced a career resurgence in 1976–1977 at age 52 due to the popularity of a Brazilian television novela (soap opera), demonstrating his enduring appeal across generations.[2]
- Before becoming a rock and roll sensation, Gonzaga was initially launched as a singer of guarânias and semi-sertanejo music, recording versions of Paraguayan folk songs and regional Brazilian styles between 1954–1957.[2]
- He was recognized as the 'Rei do Rock Balada' (King of Ballad-Rock) by Revista do Rádio in May 1959 and received the Roquette Pinto Award for Best Singer of 1958, the year 'Diana' topped the charts.[2]
