## Biography
Patti LaBelle is an American singer and actress widely regarded as the **queen of rock and soul music** and the "Godmother of Soul."[1][3] Born in 1944, she began her career in the early 1960s as lead singer of the vocal group the Ordettes, formed in 1960 with friend Cindy Birdsong after dropping out of her last semester of high school.[4] The group achieved their first top 20 pop hit in 1962 with "I Sold My Heart to the Junkman" and underwent several name changes—becoming the Bluebelles in 1961 and later LaBelle in the early 1970s.[1][3][4] As LaBelle, the group released the iconic disco song "Lady Marmalade," which later was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, making them the first African-American vocal group to land the cover of Rolling Stone magazine and the first pop group to play at the Metropolitan Opera House.[3]

Following the group's split in 1976, LaBelle launched a highly successful solo career beginning in 1977 with her self-titled debut album on Epic Records.[1][2][4] Her breakthrough as a mainstream solo star came in 1984 with hit singles including "If Only You Knew," "New Attitude," and "Stir It Up," the latter two crossing over to pop audiences.[3] In 1986, she achieved both a US number-one album, *Winner in You*, and a US number-one single with "On My Own," a duet with Michael McDonald.[2] Her 1991 album *Burnin'* went gold and featured three top five hits on the R&B charts, earning her a Grammy Award for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance in 1992 (in a rare tie with Lisa Fischer).[2][4] She won a second Grammy in 1999 for the live album *Live! One Night Only*.[2]

In a career spanning seven decades, LaBelle has sold more than 50 million records worldwide and received numerous accolades including induction into the Grammy Hall of Fame, a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1993, and induction into the Apollo Legends Hall of Fame in 2009.[1][2] She reunited with her LaBelle bandmates Nona Hendryx and Sarah Dash in 2008 to release *Back to Now*, their first full album as a group in 32 years, followed by a successful reunion tour.[1] Beyond music, LaBelle has appeared in films and television, including a role in *A Soldier's Story* (1984) and recurring roles on television series such as *Daytime Divas*, *Greenleaf*, and *Star*.[2]
