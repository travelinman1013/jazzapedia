## Biography
Marvin Louis Sapp was born on January 28, 1967, in Grand Rapids, Michigan, where he began his musical journey singing in church at age four. He attended Aenon Bible College in Indianapolis, Indiana, and in 1990 joined the legendary gospel group Commissioned, with whom he recorded throughout the 1990s. This early experience established him as a skilled vocalist within the gospel music community and provided crucial training in contemporary gospel performance.

In 1996, Sapp transitioned to a solo career, releasing his self-titled debut album on Word Records, which featured gospel hits "Calling Me" and "In His Presence." Over the following decade, he released seven albums including "Grace and Mercy," "Nothing Else Matters," "I Believe," "Diary Of A Psalmist," "Be Exalted," and "Thirsty." Sapp achieved unprecedented crossover success with "Never Would Have Made It" from his 2007 album *Thirsty*, which became a record-breaking achievement—the song spent 45 weeks at No. 1 on Billboard's gospel radio charts and became the longest-running No. 1 single across all genres in Billboard history. The album *Here I Am* (2010) further cemented his legacy, making him the all-time highest charting gospel artist in Billboard's 54-year history of tracking album sales.

Beyond his recording career, Sapp serves as senior pastor of Lighthouse Full Life Center Church and as Bishop over Global United Fellowship North Central Providence. Known for his characteristically raspy, powerful voice and his integration of biblical knowledge with musical excellence, Sapp has become one of the most recognizable voices in contemporary gospel music. He has received multiple accolades including BET Awards for Best Gospel Artist (2008, 2010), Grammy nominations, Stellar Awards, and recognition from his hometown of Grand Rapids, including the city's highest African American honor, the Giants Award.
