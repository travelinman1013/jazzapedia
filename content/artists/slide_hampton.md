## Biography
Locksley Wellington 'Slide' Hampton, born on April 21, 1932, in Jeannette, Pennsylvania, grew up in a musical family of 12 children led by his father, Duke Hampton, who formed the family band that toured the Midwest from Indianapolis. A rare left-handed trombonist, Hampton began playing trombone at age 12, performing as a singer and dancer before focusing on the instrument, influenced early on by encounters with J.J. Johnson and Wes Montgomery during family tours.[1][2][3][4] After attending Crispus Attucks High School alongside future trombone greats David Baker and J.J. Johnson, he rapidly advanced, joining Lionel Hampton's orchestra at age 20 for a Carnegie Hall performance in 1952, followed by stints with Maynard Ferguson's big band in the late 1950s, where he contributed compositions like 'The Fugue' and 'Three Little Foxes.'[3][4]

Hampton's career peaked with the formation of his Slide Hampton Octet in 1960, modeled after Miles Davis' group and featuring Freddie Hubbard, George Coleman, and Booker Little, which toured the U.S. and Europe while recording for multiple labels. He arranged and composed for luminaries including Art Blakey, Dizzy Gillespie, Thad Jones/Mel Lewis, Max Roach, Tadd Dameron, and Barry Harris, showcasing his mastery in blending small ensembles to sound orchestral. After touring Europe with Woody Herman in 1968, he stayed as an expat, collaborating with Dexter Gordon and others, before returning to the U.S. in the late 1970s. He led the World of Trombones ensemble, served as music director for projects like Dizzy Gillespie's 75th birthday celebrations with Paquito D'Rivera, and worked at Motown with Stevie Wonder and The Four Tops.[1][2][3][4]

Hampton's legacy as a trombonist, arranger, composer, and educator spanned eight decades, earning him the NEA Jazz Masters Award in 2005, two Grammy Awards (1998 for 'Cotton Tail' with Dee Dee Bridgewater and 2005 for Best Large Jazz Ensemble Album), and teaching roles at Harvard, DePaul, and other universities. He passed away on November 18, 2021, at age 89 in Orange, New Jersey, leaving an indelible mark on jazz through his innovative arrangements and profound blues-infused solos.[1][2][3][4]
