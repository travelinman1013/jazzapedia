## Biography
Joaquim Maria Dias de Castro, known professionally as Mestre Cupijó, was born on July 26, 1936, in Cametá, Pará, Brazil, into a musical family. His father, Vicente Castro (Mestre Sicudera), was a music professor and conductor of the Banda Sociedade Euterpe Cametaense, one of Brazil's oldest municipal bands founded in 1874. Cupijó began studying music at age 12 and by 13 was already performing clarinet in the Jazz Batuta do Ritmo group and later in the Euterpe band. He initially pursued careers as a provisional lawyer and city councilman in Cametá, but his true passion remained music.

Cupijó earned the title "Reinventor of Siriá," a traditional Pará folk rhythm historically sung by Black communities and considered a cousin of carimbó. He modernized this regional rhythm by accelerating its beat, adding brass arrangements, and incorporating Caribbean influences such as mambo and merengue, transforming it into a nationally recognized musical style. Beginning as a clarinetist, he became famous for his saxophone work after taking over the position when the city band's saxophonist passed away. During the 1970s and 1980s, he released six official LP albums through labels including Continental, Escorpião, and Chantecler, though he never achieved financial success from his music and worked as a state public servant to support himself.

Mestre Cupijó passed away on September 25, 2012, in Belém from organ failure, following years of illness including lung cancer, prostate cancer, and diabetes. His legacy was preserved through a 2019 biographical documentary titled "Siriá por Mestre Cupijó" directed by his niece Jorane Castro, and through the formation of the Baile do Mestre Cupijó ensemble in 2024, which released a studio album featuring 15 tracks of his compositions performed by 11 young musicians from the region.

## Fun Facts
- Cupijó switched from clarinet to saxophone not by choice but by necessity—he took over the saxophone position in the city band after the original saxophonist passed away, and this instrument change led to his greatest fame.
- Despite being one of Brazil's most important traditional musicians and a master composer and orchestrator, Cupijó never achieved financial success from his music and had to work as a state public servant and provisional lawyer to support himself throughout his life.
- The Banda Sociedade Euterpe Cametaense, where Cupijó performed and which was directed by his father and grandfather, was the only band to perform at the festivities marking the end of slavery in Pará in 1888, making it historically significant beyond just music.
- After his death in 2012, family members and fans secured funding through Brazil's Lei Semear cultural incentive law to digitize and re-record his 1970s vinyl albums, preserving 12 selected songs and numerous unpublished compositions he had written throughout his life.
