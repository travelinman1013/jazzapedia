## Biography
Earl Rudolph 'Bud' Powell was born on September 27, 1924, in Harlem, Manhattan, New York City, to William Powell, a building superintendent who played piano, and Pearl Young. Surrounded by music from a young age, Powell began picking out tunes on the piano by 1929, learned from his father starting at age three, and took professional lessons at six. His brothers, William (trumpet and violin) and Richie (piano), also influenced his early musical environment. Initially trained classically and mastering pieces like James P. Johnson's 'Carolina Shout,' Powell shifted to jazz as a preteen, frequenting Harlem venues like Uptown House and Minton’s Playhouse. He quit DeWitt Clinton High School at 15 to play professionally, joining his brother’s band and gigs at spots like the Chicken Coop and Palace.

Powell’s career took off in the early 1940s, playing with Cootie Williams’s band (1942–1944), where he recorded the first version of Thelonious Monk’s '’Round Midnight.' Emerging as a bebop pioneer by the mid-1940s, he collaborated with Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie at the Three Deuces in 1945, and formed his own trio with Curly Russell and Max Roach in 1947. His revolutionary style—featuring a sparse, syncopated left-hand chordal accompaniment supporting rapid, single-note right-hand lines—influenced by Art Tatum, Billy Kyle, Monk, and Parker, redefined jazz piano, emphasizing speed and improvisation akin to horn players. Despite severe setbacks, including a 1945 beating by police leading to psychiatric hospitalizations, tuberculosis, and alcoholism, Powell recorded classics like 'Hallucinations (Budo),' 'Un Poco Loco,' 'Dance of the Infidels,' 'Tempus Fugue-It,' and 'Wail' for labels like Blue Note and Clef. He lived in Paris from 1959–1964 under the care of Francis Paudras, returning to New York where his health declined.

Powell died on July 31, 1966, in Brooklyn, New York, at age 41 from complications including alcoholism and tuberculosis. His legacy as bebop’s most influential pianist endures, shaping modern jazz piano with standards like 'Bouncing with Bud' and 'Parisian Thoroughfare,' and inspiring films like *Round Midnight*. Even amid institutionalizations and legal incompetence rulings, his tireless creativity and digital dexterity left an indelible mark, with admirers noting his ability to produce startling ideas against all odds.
