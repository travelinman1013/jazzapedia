## Biography
The Rhythm Makers were a Bronx-based funk and proto-disco band active in the mid-1970s, emerging from the vibrant New York R&B scene just as disco was beginning to take shape.[1][4] Originally formed under the name Sabu and the Survivors, the group eventually settled on The Rhythm Makers, with a core lineup of bassist Keith "Sabu" Crier, keyboardist Herb Lane, drummer Kenny Banks, and rhythm guitarist Rahiem LeBlanc.[1] Drawing on soul, funk, and Latin-tinged New York club sounds, they crafted tight, groove-oriented arrangements that captured the energy of Bronx dance floors in the period leading up to disco’s commercial explosion.[1]

In 1976 the band released its sole album, *Soul On Your Side*, now regarded by collectors and funk aficionados as a quintessential example of mid-’70s proto-disco funk.[1] Featuring driving bass lines, crisp rhythm guitar, and lush keyboards, the record blended deep funk with smoother, dance-friendly textures that anticipated the sound of late-’70s disco and boogie.[1] Although The Rhythm Makers did not enjoy major mainstream success at the time, their work laid the foundation for the more commercially successful group GQ, which included several of the same members and went on to score hit singles in the disco and post-disco era.[1][4] Over time, tracks from *Soul On Your Side* have been championed by DJs, reissue labels, and hip-hop producers, leading to renewed appreciation for the band’s contribution to funk and disco history.[1]

The group’s legacy rests on the enduring cult status of *Soul On Your Side* and its influence on later R&B and dance music through both direct continuity (via GQ) and sampling.[1][4] Funk enthusiasts often cite the album’s seamless blend of hard-edged grooves and melodic, club-ready arrangements as emblematic of the Bronx sound of the era, and individual members—particularly Rahiem LeBlanc (also known as Mr. Q)—continued performing into the 1980s and beyond, keeping the group’s stylistic spirit alive on stage even after The Rhythm Makers name faded from the charts.[1] Though their recorded output was limited, The Rhythm Makers occupy a distinct niche in the evolution of New York funk and early disco, bridging underground dance-floor culture and the more polished R&B that followed.[1][4]
