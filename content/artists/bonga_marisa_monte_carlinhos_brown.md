## Biography
“Bonga, Marisa Monte, Carlinhos Brown” is not a fixed band but rather a notable one‑off collaboration between three established Lusophone artists: Angolan singer Bonga, and Brazilian musicians Marisa Monte and Carlinhos Brown. Their best‑known joint appearance is on the track “Mulemba Xangola,” recorded in 1998 for the AIDS‑benefit compilation *Onda Sonora: Red Hot + Lisbon*, an album organized by the Red Hot Organization to spotlight Portuguese‑language music while raising funds and awareness around HIV/AIDS.[1][5] On this recording, Bonga’s soulful semba vocals and Angolan rhythmic sensibility intertwine with Monte’s refined Brazilian popular and bossa‑influenced singing and Brown’s Afro‑Bahian percussion, creating a cross‑Atlantic dialogue that links Angola’s post‑colonial musical identity with contemporary Brazilian pop and samba‑reggae currents.[1][4][5]

Though this trio has not functioned as a formal, ongoing group, the collaboration sits at the intersection of their individual careers and exemplifies broader Lusophone musical exchange in the late 1990s. By 1998, Bonga was already a major figure in Angolan music and diaspora culture, known for helping to “place Angola in the world” through the dissemination of semba and politically conscious songs.[4] Marisa Monte, emerging from Rio de Janeiro’s MPB and bossa nova milieu, had by then built a critically acclaimed discography blending classic Brazilian songwriting with contemporary production and had begun deep creative partnerships with artists such as Carlinhos Brown and Arnaldo Antunes.[3][8] Brown, a pioneering percussionist and composer from Salvador’s Candeal neighborhood and co‑creator of samba‑reggae, was simultaneously consolidating his solo career and projects like Timbalada, using experimental percussion and Afro‑Brazilian rhythms to expand Brazilian popular music’s palette.[1][2] “Mulemba Xangola” thus represents a moment where these three trajectories converge in service of a global, socially engaged Lusophone project.[1][5]

Musically, their joint track is rooted in Angolan melodic and rhythmic patterns associated with semba and Afro‑Lusophone tradition, animated by Brown’s layered percussion and the Brazilian pop sophistication Monte brought from her work with Blue Note and her own Phonomotor label.[3][4][5] The blend underscores shared Afro‑diasporic roots between Angola and Brazil while highlighting each artist’s distinct voice: Bonga’s husky, emotionally resonant singing, Monte’s controlled and lyrical phrasing, and Brown’s polyrhythmic drive and studio inventiveness. Within the broader Red Hot catalog—which frequently pairs artists across geographies and genres—the song stands as a small but emblematic contribution to the visibility of Portuguese‑language music in the global “world music” market and a snapshot of late‑1990s Lusophone collaboration.[1][5]

Because this was a special‑project studio collaboration, there is no evidence that “Bonga, Marisa Monte, Carlinhos Brown” toured or recorded as a standing ensemble beyond this track, nor that they adopted a collective identity separate from their individual careers and, in Monte and Brown’s case, their more formal group Tribalistas.[1][3][8] Their legacy as a trio is therefore primarily discographic and symbolic: a single, well‑documented collaboration illustrating the cultural and musical ties between Angola and Brazil within an international, philanthropic context.[1][4][5]

## Fun Facts
- The only widely documented recording credited jointly to Bonga, Marisa Monte, and Carlinhos Brown is the track “Mulemba Xangola,” created specifically for the AIDS‑benefit compilation *Onda Sonora: Red Hot + Lisbon* rather than for any of their solo albums.[1][5]
- Carlinhos Brown, who brings the distinctive percussion colors to the trio’s collaboration, grew up in the Candeal neighborhood of Salvador and became a leading figure in the creation and popularization of samba‑reggae before working on projects like *Onda Sonora*.[1][2]
- Marisa Monte not only collaborated vocally with Carlinhos Brown but also produced his second solo album *Omelete Man*, underscoring the depth of their creative relationship beyond their appearance with Bonga on “Mulemba Xangola.”[1][3]
- Bonga is often described as a voice that “helps to place Angola in the world,” and his participation in a globally distributed Red Hot compilation with Brazilian stars like Monte and Brown extended that mission to new international audiences.[4][5]
