## Biography
Roberto Torres, born February 10, 1940, in Güines, Cuba, is a renowned Cuban musician, composer, singer, and producer who became a pivotal figure in spreading Cuban music throughout the diaspora. He began his singing career at age 16 in 1956 and emigrated to the United States in 1959 following the Cuban Revolution, initially settling in Miami before relocating to New York. Torres established himself as a versatile performer, serving as a member of La Sonora Matancera for three years before launching his solo career and founding his own musical groups.

Torres is best known for creating and popularizing "charanga vallenata," a distinctive fusion genre combining Cuban charanga music with Colombian vallenato rhythms. His most significant commercial success came with his interpretation of Simón Díaz's "Caballo Viejo," which became a massive hit across Latin America. Beyond this signature sound, Torres revitalized traditional Cuban rhythms including guajira, guaracha, son cubano, and montuno, establishing himself as a cultural ambassador for Cuban music. In 1979, he founded the record labels Guajiro Records and SAR Records, through which he produced numerous albums and contributed to a broader renaissance of authentic Cuban music in the early 1980s.

Throughout his career, Torres demonstrated exceptional versatility as both a vocalist and multi-instrumentalist, performing on claves, maracas, and güiro in addition to his primary vocal work. His contributions to Latin music extended beyond performance; in 1999, he participated in the documentary "Son sabrosón: antesala de la salsa" alongside legendary artists Arturo Sandoval, Rosendo Rosell, and Celia Cruz. Torres's legacy encompasses not only his distinctive artistic innovations but also his role in preserving and evolving Cuban musical traditions for international audiences.
