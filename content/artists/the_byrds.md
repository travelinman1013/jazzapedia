## Biography
The Byrds were formed in Los Angeles in 1964 as one of the most influential American rock groups of all time, initially called the Jet Set before changing their name to the Beefeaters and finally the Byrds.[1][2] The core members—Jim (Roger) McGuinn, Gene Clark, and David Crosby—all had roots in the folk world, having performed in coffee houses with groups like the New Christy Minstrels.[3] Inspired by the Beatles' success, they combined their folk background with rock instrumentation, with McGuinn's Rickenbacker 12-string electric guitar becoming a trademark of their sound.[3] After adding bassist Chris Hillman and drummer Michael Clarke, the band was signed to Columbia Records and achieved immediate success with their 1965 debut single, a reworked version of Bob Dylan's "Mr. Tambourine Man," which reached number one and broke the British Invasion's dominance of American Top 40 airplay.[1][2]

Throughout the mid-to-late 1960s, the Byrds pioneered multiple genres and remained at the forefront of rock innovation.[1][2][3] They popularized folk rock and introduced Dylan's songwriting to a mainstream teenage audience, establishing a distinctly American "mod" style of rock.[2] As the 1960s counterculture evolved, their sound became increasingly psychedelic, evident in their 1966 single "Eight Miles High."[3] In 1968, the band underwent significant changes when David Crosby left to join Crosby, Stills and Nash, and Gram Parsons briefly joined, profoundly influencing the album "Sweetheart of the Rodeo"—considered the first country-rock album by a mainstream rock band.[1][2][3] By 1973, with McGuinn as the sole remaining founding member, the band went on hiatus.[2] The Byrds reunited briefly in 1990 to record four new songs for a boxed set and were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1991.[1][2]

## Fun Facts
- When the band was first forming, drummer Michael Clarke didn't own a drum kit, so he learned to play on a set of cardboard boxes with a tambourine taped to the top, and bassist Chris Hillman was playing a cheap Japanese bass until manager Jim Dickson obtained a $5,000 loan to purchase real instruments.[1]
- The band's name was a playful homage to the Beatles—both groups used animal names that were deliberately misspelled, and McGuinn bought a Rickenbacker 12-string electric guitar after seeing the Beatles play similar instruments in the film "A Hard Day's Night."[3]
- Jim McGuinn changed his first name to Roger in the late 1960s at the urging of an Indonesian guru, who claimed that a name beginning with 'R' would 'resonate better with the universe.'[1]
- Gram Parsons quit the band during their South African tour in 1968 because he refused to play in the country due to its racial policies, and Chris Hillman left in disgust after the band was booked into White-only clubs despite being promised integrated audiences; Hillman and Parsons subsequently formed The Flying Burrito Brothers.[1]
