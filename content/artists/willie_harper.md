## Biography
Willie Harper was a rhythm and blues singer and songwriter from New Orleans who emerged as a notable but underrecognized talent in the city's R&B scene during the 1960s and early 1970s.[1][3] Associated closely with producer Allen Toussaint throughout most of the 1960s, Harper worked steadily as both a backing vocalist and featured artist, though he never achieved major commercial success despite releasing more than a dozen singles.[1] His collaboration with Toussaint on the Alon label produced quality work across multiple genres, showcasing Harper's versatility and raw, emotive vocal style.[1][3]

Harper's recording career began with his debut single "New Kind Of Love/But I Couldn't" (Alon 9000) in 1961, which marked both his solo debut and the label's first release.[1] Over the following years, he recorded for various labels including Alon and Sansu, with notable releases such as "Power Of Love/Cloudy Weather" (1962) and collaborations like "Grumblin' Fussin' Nag Nag/Kolank Kolank" with The Man in 1964.[1] Despite the quality of his recordings and Toussaint's faith in his talent, Harper remained largely obscure outside of dedicated soul music circles, though his work has since been rediscovered by Northern Soul enthusiasts and music historians.[1][3]

## Fun Facts

- Despite releasing more than a dozen singles as lead or co-vocalist throughout the 1960s, only a couple achieved even local hit status in New Orleans, making him one of the city's most underrecognized talents.[1]
- His recordings were eventually compiled on a Japanese LP titled 'Battle of Soul,' which featured released and unreleased tracks from several artists on the Sansu family of labels, demonstrating his enduring appeal to dedicated soul music collectors.[1]
