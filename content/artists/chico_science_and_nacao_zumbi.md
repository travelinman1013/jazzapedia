## Biography
Chico Science & Nação Zumbi emerged from Recife, Pernambuco in Brazil's impoverished Northeast, founded around 1991 by Francisco de Assis França (March 13, 1966 – February 2, 1997), known as Chico Science, alongside Fred 04 of Mundo Livre S/A. The band evolved from earlier musical projects including Loustal (formed 1989) and Lamento Negro, eventually solidifying as an eight-member ensemble by 1994. The group's name references Zumbi dos Palmares, a 17th-century Capoeira warrior chief who led the quilombo Republic of Palmares as a refuge for escaped slaves and the oppressed. Chico Science served as the charismatic lead vocalist and primary creative force, bringing an intense stage presence compared by critics to Jimi Hendrix.

The band pioneered the manguebeat cultural movement, a revolutionary fusion that blended rock, funk, hip-hop, and electronica with traditional Brazilian rhythms, particularly maracatu and regional folk styles of the Northeast. Their groundbreaking 1994 debut album 'Da Lama Ao Caos' (From Mud to Chaos) created a cultural shockwave comparable to the Sex Pistols' impact in Britain. Drawing influences from James Brown, Grandmaster Flash, Kurtis Blow, Public Enemy, and Pink Floyd, they created music that world critics found 'original and distinctive of his region.' The band made their US debut at New York's Central Park Summerstage in 1995, opening for Gilberto Gil, and performed at venues including CBGB's, SOB's, and Bryant Park. Their 1996 album 'Afrociberdelia' continued their innovative trajectory, and they toured extensively throughout Europe and the United States, bringing international attention to Brazil's new generation of artists.

Chico Science's tragic death in a car accident on February 2, 1997, at age 30, shocked the Brazilian music world. The New York Times hailed him as 'the future of Brazilian music,' and the Governor of Pernambuco declared three days of mourning. Despite releasing only two full albums during his lifetime, his influence became foundational for a new generation of Brazilian musicians. Nação Zumbi continued without him, releasing the posthumous album 'CSNZ' in 1998 and maintaining an active international presence for three decades. In 2008, Rolling Stone Brasil ranked Chico Science as the 16th greatest Brazilian artist of all time.

## Fun Facts
- The band's name 'Nação Zumbi' is often mistranslated as 'Zombie Nation,' but actually references Zumbi dos Palmares, a 17th-century Capoeira warrior chief who defended the quilombo Republic of Palmares as a refuge for escaped slaves and the oppressed.
- Chico Science's stage presence was compared by critics to Jimi Hendrix, and he was described as an 'intense frontman' who didn't merely dabble in culture but lived it—simultaneously functioning as a rapper, embalador (singer of embolada), rocker, and ragamuffin singer.
- The manguebeat movement was symbolized by the tidal mudflats ('manguezis') surrounding central Recife, with its founders and artists collectively dubbed 'caranguejos com cerebro' (crabs with brains), representing a fusion of global cultural influences with the fertile local scene.
- Their 1994 debut album 'Da Lama Ao Caos' created a cultural shockwave in Brazil comparable to the Sex Pistols' impact in Britain, yet their second album 'Afrociberdelia' (1996) received minimal acknowledgment in some markets before Chico's untimely death in February 1997.
