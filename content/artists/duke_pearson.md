# Duke Pearson

## Biography
Columbus Calvin 'Duke' Pearson Jr. was born on August 17, 1932, in Atlanta, Georgia, where he began studying brass instruments and piano as a youth. His uncle, an admirer of Duke Ellington, nicknamed him 'Duke' after recognizing his piano talent. Initially favoring trumpet through high school and college at Clark College, dental problems forced him to switch to piano, especially after being inspired by pianist Wynton Kelly during his U.S. Army service in 1953-54.[1][2][3][4]

Pearson moved to New York in January 1959, quickly joining Donald Byrd's band and the Art Farmer-Benny Golson Jazztet, while also accompanying Nancy Wilson. He became a key figure at Blue Note Records, producing sessions from 1963 to 1970 after Ike Quebec's death, shaping the label's hard bop sound. As a leader, he recorded albums like *A New Perspective* (1964), *Wahoo!* (1964), *Sweet Honey Bee* (1966), *The Right Touch* (1967), and *The Phantom* (1968), known for compositions such as 'Cristo Redentor,' 'Jeannine,' and 'Idle Moments.' His style blended hard bop, soul jazz, and innovative arrangements.[1][2][3][4][5]

Pearson retired from Blue Note in 1971 amid label changes, taught at Clark College, toured with Carmen McRae and Joe Williams until 1973, and reformed his big band. Diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in the 1970s, he died on August 4, 1980, at Atlanta Veterans Hospital, leaving a legacy as a pivotal behind-the-scenes architect of 1960s jazz.[2][3][5]

## Fun Facts
- Pearson once fell ill before a Donald Byrd-Pepper Adams show in 1961, leading Herbie Hancock to substitute and eventually take his spot permanently in the quintet.[2][3][4][5]
- 'Cristo Redentor' was inspired by a trip to Brazil during his tour with Nancy Wilson.[4][5]
- He recorded with his co-led big band with Donald Byrd for Atlantic Records while contracted with Blue Note, insisting on a stipulation allowing this.[5]
- Dental problems in youth forced him to abandon brass, shifting fully to piano despite early trumpet passion.[1][2][3][4]
