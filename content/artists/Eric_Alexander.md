## Biography
Eric Alexander is an American jazz saxophonist, composer, and educator born on August 4, 1968, in Galesburg, Illinois.[3][8] He began his musical journey as a classical pianist at age six, later taking up clarinet at nine and switching to alto saxophone at twelve.[1][4] During his one year at Indiana University, Bloomington (1986-87), Alexander's passion for jazz ignited, prompting him to switch to the tenor saxophone.[1][6] He subsequently transferred to William Paterson University in New Jersey, where he studied under jazz luminaries including Harold Mabern, Joe Lovano, Rufus Reid, Gary Smulyan, Norman Simmons, and Steve Turre.[2][3] This rigorous training in the bebop tradition shaped his sophisticated approach to hard bop and post-bop jazz.

Alexander gained international recognition after placing second behind Joshua Redman at the 1991 Thelonious Monk International Jazz Saxophone Competition, ahead of Chris Potter and Tim Warfield.[3] This achievement led to a recording contract, and he made his recording debut with organ great Charles Earland in 1991, followed by his debut album as leader, "Straight Up," on Delmark in 1992.[1][3] Throughout the 1990s and beyond, Alexander established himself as a prolific recording artist and bandleader, releasing over 80 albums as leader and appearing on over 300 recordings as a sideman.[1][3] In 1998, he co-founded One For All, an ongoing hard-bop ensemble with Jim Rotondi, Steve Davis, Joe Farnsworth, Peter Washington, and Dave Hazeltine, which drew comparisons to Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers.[1][4]

Alexander's career is defined by his warm, finely burnished tone and robust melodic and harmonic imagination within the bop-based jazz tradition.[1] He has worked extensively with jazz luminaries including Harold Mabern, Ron Carter, Idris Muhammad, Pat Martino, Mike LeDonne, and McCoy Tyner.[3][7] Since signing with HighNote Records in 2004, he has released numerous acclaimed albums including "Chicago Fire," "The Real Thing" (with Pat Martino), and "Song of No Regrets."[5] Beyond his prolific recording career, Alexander serves as an educator, leading masterclasses and passing his knowledge to the next generation of jazz musicians.[5]
