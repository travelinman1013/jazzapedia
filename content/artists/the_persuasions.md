## Biography
The Persuasions, an a cappella vocal group renowned for their doo-wop, gospel, soul, and eclectic reinterpretations of popular music, formed in 1962 in Brooklyn, New York, when five friends—Jerry Lawson, Jimmy Hayes, Joe Russell, Jayotis Washington, and Herbert “Toubo” Rhoad—began harmonizing on outdoor basketball courts after pickup games. Hailing from diverse backgrounds including Florida, North Carolina, Virginia, and Detroit, all members drew heavily from church gospel traditions, blending it with soul, early rock, jazz, and pop into rich five-part harmonies sung under streetlights and in subway corridors. Their street-corner style evolved into a professional career after a chance discovery in 1968-1969, when producer David Dashev played their tape over the phone to Frank Zappa, who signed them to his Straight label and produced their debut album *A Cappella* in 1970.[1][2][3][4]

Over a five-decade career, The Persuasions released 25-28 albums, tributing artists like Frank Zappa (*Frankly A Cappella: The Persuasions Sing Zappa*, 2000), The Grateful Dead, The Beatles, U2, Bob Dylan, and even a children's album *On The Good Ship Lollipop* (1999), which won multiple parents' awards. Led by Jerry Lawson's smoky baritone (originally a tenor), effortless arrangements, and charismatic stage presence—often compared to Sam Cooke, Brook Benton, and Otis Redding—the group performed worldwide, opening for legends and joining tours like Joni Mitchell's *Shadows and Light* (1979). Despite limited mainstream radio play and mislabeling as 'doo-wop oldies,' they built a devoted audience, influencing modern a cappella acts with their instrument-free virtuosity.[1][2][3]

The group's legacy endures as pioneers who paved the way for contemporary a cappella stars like Take 6, Bobby McFerrin, Boyz II Men, and Pentatonix, while maintaining sold-out shows into recent years under vocal arranger Dave Revels, with original member Jayotis Washington still performing. Original members like Joe Russell, Jimmy Hayes, and Toubo Rhoad passed away (most recently Hayes in 2017), but The Persuasions remain 'Kings of A Cappella,' celebrated for their organic sound and live legend status.[1][2][3]
