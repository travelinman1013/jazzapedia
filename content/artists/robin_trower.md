## Biography
Robin Leonard Trower, born on March 9, 1945, in Catford, London, England, began his musical career in the mid-1960s with the Southend rhythm and blues band The Paramounts alongside Gary Brooker and B.J. Wilson, focusing on rock and roll and R&B.[2][3][5][6] He gained prominence in 1967 joining Procol Harum, contributing to five albums and extensive tours, though not on their hit 'A Whiter Shade of Pale,' helping define their baroque rock sound during the late 1960s.[1][2][3][4][5] Leaving Procol Harum in 1971, Trower launched a solo career modeled after power trios like Cream, Taste, and Jimi Hendrix Experience, assembling a band with vocalist/bassist James Dewar and drummer Reg Isidore.[1][2][4]

His 1973 debut solo album *Twice Removed from Yesterday* set the stage, but 1974's *Bridge of Sighs* propelled him to international fame as a guitar hero, selling a million copies with standout tracks like 'Day of the Eagle,' 'Too Rolling Stoned,' and 'Lady Love,' featuring his atmospheric, effects-laden Fender Stratocaster style often compared to Hendrix but distinctly blues-infused.[1][2][4][5] Trower's career evolved through the 1970s and beyond, exploring blues rock on albums like *In City Dreams* and *Caravan to Midnight*, starting his own V12 label in 1994 with *20th Century Blues*, and collaborating on projects into the 2000s and 2010s, including *Seven Moons* with Jack Bruce and *Something’s About To Change* in 2015, maintaining a vital sound rooted in post-war U.S. blues.[2][4]

Known for his 'heavy strings' style with heavy reverberation, Trower's musical legacy spans over six decades, influencing guitarists while retaining a dedicated U.S. live following despite shifts in popular music; at 76, he continues touring with innovative late-period work using Fender Stratocaster and Marshall amps.[2][4][5]

- He started his own V12 record label in 1994 to gain creative control, releasing *20th Century Blues* and bypassing traditional industry constraints.[2]
- Trower began taking lead vocals in the 1990s to ensure songs matched his original vision, noting, 'When you sing it yourself it tends to come out how you heard it in your head.'[2]
- An ardent Fender Stratocaster user, Trower is known for his 'heavy strings' style with heavy reverberation, favorably compared to Jimi Hendrix.[5]
