## Biography
John Roger Stephens, known professionally as John Legend, was born on December 28, 1978, in Springfield, Ohio. A child prodigy, he was taught piano by his grandmother and sang in the church choir from a young age. He attended the University of Pennsylvania, graduating with a B.A. in 1999, after which he worked as a management consultant for the Boston Consulting Group while performing in New York nightclubs and releasing independent albums: his self-titled demo (2000) and Live at Jimmy's Uptown (2001).[1][2][3][4]

Legend's career breakthrough came after Devo Springsteen introduced him to Kanye West in 2001. As the first signee to West's GOOD Music label, he released his debut album Get Lifted in 2004, featuring the hit 'Ordinary People,' which earned him three Grammy Awards including Best New Artist. His style fuses R&B, soul, neo soul, and soft pop, with subsequent albums like Once Again (2006), Evolver (2008), Wake Up! with the Roots (2010), and Love in the Future (2013) solidifying his success. Notable collaborations include 'Glory' with Common for the 2014 film Selma, winning an Oscar and Golden Globe.[1][2][3][4]

Legend's legacy extends beyond music as an EGOT winner (Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, Tony)—the first Black male and second youngest recipient—achieved in 2018 via Jesus Christ Superstar Live in Concert, where he portrayed Jesus and won for producing. He has released albums like Bigger Love (2020, Grammy for Best R&B Album) and Legend (2022), served as a coach on The Voice since 2019, and acted as Chief Music Officer for Headspace since 2025, with 12 Grammy Awards overall.[2][3]
