## Biography
Diana Gordon, born August 25, 1985, in Queens, New York, is an American singer, songwriter, and producer who has built a multifaceted career spanning both behind-the-scenes songwriting and independent artistry. She began her musical education at the Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts in New York, where she was exposed to diverse musical traditions and cultures that would shape her artistic sensibility. After high school, Gordon worked as an intern at a record company while supporting herself as a coat-check girl in Brooklyn clubs. Her breakthrough came in 2004 when she began collaborating with producer D'Mile, leading to her writing "Gonna Breakthrough," the title track for Mary J. Blige's 2005 album *The Breakthrough*. This success led to a recording contract with Atlantic Records in 2006.

For 12 years, Gordon released music under the stage name Wynter Gordon, becoming known for her work in electronic dance music and pop. Her 2011 debut album *With the Music I Die* featured the hit single "Dirty Talk," which reached number one in Australia and achieved triple platinum certification there, while also charting in the UK and Ireland. During this period, she established herself as a prolific songwriter and collaborator, contributing to albums by major artists including Jennifer Lopez, Danity Kane, and David Guetta. Her most significant songwriting achievement came in 2016 when she co-wrote and produced multiple tracks on Beyoncé's critically acclaimed album *Lemonade*, including "Sorry," "Don't Hurt Yourself," and "Daddy Lessons," earning her a Grammy nomination for Album of the Year as a producer.

In 2016, Gordon reclaimed her birth name and shifted toward independent artistry, releasing the EP *Pure* (2018) and *Wasted Youth* (2020). This transition reflected her desire to express her authentic voice rather than conform to commercial expectations. She has continued collaborating selectively with artists like Brent Faiyaz, Mark Ronson, and Lil Yachty, while maintaining creative control over her solo work. Her career demonstrates a deliberate evolution from club-oriented pop music to more introspective, genre-blending compositions that draw from gospel, country, R&B, and world music influences.
