## Biography
Tiffany Austin, born and raised in South Los Angeles, grew up immersed in music through her parents' love for soul and pop artists like Donny Hathaway and Stevie Wonder, and her Louisiana Creole grandmother's introduction to jazz, which instilled in her a deep sense of soul and self-assurance. She graduated from the Los Angeles High School of the Arts, majored in creative writing at Cal State Northridge while studying classical voice, and spent time in the U.K. sitting in on jazz sessions. After graduating in 2004, she moved to Tokyo, where she worked steadily as an R&B singer for five years, honing her skills full-time.[2][1][3]

Returning to the U.S. in 2009 to attend UC Berkeley School of Law on scholarship, Austin initially set aside music but soon sought a creative outlet, enrolling at the California Jazz Conservatory (formerly Jazzschool) on a full scholarship. There, her original style caught the attention of Bay Area bandleaders, leading her to work with bassist Marcus Shelby and saxophonist Howard Wiley. Earning her Juris Doctorate in 2012, she chose music over the bar exam, founding her label Con Alma Music and launching her career with the 2015 debut album *Nothing But Soul*, featuring Hoagy Carmichael reimaginings, which earned acclaim from DownBeat, NPR's Fresh Air, and others. Her 2017 follow-up *Unbroken* showcased her songwriting, addressing Black history and resilience through pieces evoking Amédé Ardoin, Charles Mingus, and the Tulsa Greenwood massacre.[1][2][3][5][6]

Based in the San Francisco Bay Area (Berkeley/East Bay), Austin blends **vocal jazz** with blues, R&B, gospel, and soul, drawing melismatic influences from Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, Nina Simone, and Ella Fitzgerald, while incorporating Coltrane's spiritual depth. A rising star, she performs internationally, teaches vocals, music theory, and leads choirs, establishing a legacy as a modern jazz vocalist rooted in African-American traditions who challenges purists by embracing soulful expressiveness.[1][2][3][6][7]
