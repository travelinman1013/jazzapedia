# SAM CHATMON

## Biography
Vivian 'Sam' Chatmon (January 10, 1897 – February 2, 1983) was born in Bolton, Mississippi, into a renowned musical family known for their string band performances of rags, ballads, and popular dance tunes. He began playing guitar at age three, laying it flat on the floor, and by age four was singing blues songs; he performed regularly for white audiences in the 1900s and played banjo, mandolin, harmonica, and guitar at parties and street corners throughout Mississippi. Chatmon may have been half-brother to Charley Patton, and in the 1920s-1930s, he recorded with brothers Lonnie Chatmon and Bo Carter alongside Walter Vinson as the Mississippi Sheiks, and separately as the Chatmon Brothers.[1][3][6]

In the early 1940s, Chatmon moved to Hollandale, Mississippi, working on plantations and as a night watchman, playing music sporadically until his rediscovery in 1960, which launched a prolific folk-blues revival career. He recorded for Arhoolie in 1960, Blue Goose (1970), Albatros (1977), Rounder (1979), and Flying Fish (1981), and toured extensively in the 1960s-1970s, performing at major festivals like the Smithsonian Folklife Festival (1972), Mariposa Folk Festival (1974), and New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival (1976). In 1970, while in California, he formed 'The California Sheiks' with Sue Draheim, Kenny Hall, and others, and reunited with Walter Vinson as the New Mississippi Sheiks in 1972.[1][3]

Chatmon's style blended Delta blues with country blues, ragtime, and classic blues, characterized by his rich voice and deft guitar work. He died in Hollandale at age 86; Bonnie Raitt funded his headstone inscribed 'Sitting on Top of the World' in 1998, and he received a Mississippi Blues Trail marker.[1]
