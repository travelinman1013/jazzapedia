# BATISTE BROTHERS BAND

## Biography
The Batiste Brothers Band emerged from the renowned musical Batiste family of New Orleans, formed in 1976 when David Batiste's group, David Batiste and the Gladiators, evolved into the family band. Comprising seven brothers including Paul (guitar, flute, songwriter), Michael (bassist), Damon, and Russell Jr. (drummer), the band blended R&B, soul, funk, and quintessential New Orleans music. David Batiste, the patriarch and keyboardist, had earlier performed on the Chitlin' Circuit with artists like Jackie Wilson and Isaac Hayes, instilling a deep-rooted tradition of performance from a young age; his children, including Damon who joined at age 13 and Russell at 15, began performing on stage as early as six or seven.

The band's career highlighted their commitment to New Orleans culture, with regular performances at events like the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, where they appeared multiple times, and international tours to Japan that made young members world travelers. Damon Batiste, a key figure, contributed to Frenchmen Street music venues and performed with side projects like Damon Batiste and the New Orleans All Stars alongside Mardi Gras Indian Chief Shaka Zulu. Their style emphasized jamming, happiness, and community grooves, influencing younger generations within the family.

The Batiste Brothers Band's legacy endures as part of New Orleans' musical royalty, setting a foundational course for family members like Jon Batiste, who played percussion with them at age 8 before rising to national prominence. They represent the Batiste family's multi-generational impact, with the band active since the late 1970s and continuing to embody the city's vibrant R&B, funk, and brass traditions.

## Fun Facts
