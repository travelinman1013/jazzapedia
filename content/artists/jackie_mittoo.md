## Biography
Donat Roy 'Jackie' Mittoo, born in Brown's Town, Jamaica, in March 1948, was a musical prodigy who showed interest in music from age four, learning piano from his grandmother and playing professionally by age thirteen after moving to Kingston. He joined early bands like the Rivals and Sheiks, where he met future Skatalites members, before becoming a founding member of the Skatalites at age 16 in 1964, credited with inventing the ska sound under Coxsone Dodd at Studio One. After the Skatalites disbanded in 1965, Mittoo formed the Soul Brothers with Roland Alphonso, transitioned to rocksteady with hits like 'Ram Jam,' and led the Sound Dimension as reggae emerged, serving as Studio One's musical director and arranging thousands of tracks for artists including the Wailers.[1][2][3][4]

Mittoo emigrated to Toronto, Canada, in 1969, becoming part of the local reggae scene while continuing to record in Jamaica with the reformed Skatalites, Byron Lee and the Dragonaires, and others. In Canada, he released albums like *Wishbone*, *Reggae Magic*, and *Let’s Put it All Together*, worked with Summer Records, and explored easy listening, but his most influential work remained rooted in Jamaican styles. His expressive organ playing, innovative arrangements, and pioneering bass-heavy reggae shaped the evolution from ska to roots reggae, dub, and beyond.[1][2][3][5]

Mittoo died of cancer in Toronto in 1990 at age 42, receiving a grand send-off in Kingston that reflected his stellar status. His legacy as a keyboardist, arranger, and pioneer endures, influencing global reggae with indelible contributions like 'Hot Milk,' 'Peenie Wallie,' and 'Drum Song,' and collaborations extending to the UK and USA.[2][4][5]

## Fun Facts
- Mittoo had exceptional musical ear; a colleague recalled he could identify a 'minor' chord from a penny dropping on the floor.
- He unusually served as lead singer on his ska single 'Got My Bugaloo,' rare for the primarily instrumentalist.
- Pioneered bass-heavy reggae by writing bass lines himself for the Jackie Mittoo Trio with Leroy Sibbles.
- Died tragically young at 42, but his Kingston funeral at the National Arena highlighted his immense respect in Jamaica.
