## Biography
Alberta Hunter (April 1, 1895 – October 17, 1984) was an American blues and jazz singer who rose from poverty in Memphis, Tennessee to become one of the most influential vocalists of the 20th century. She left home at age twelve to pursue singing in Chicago, where she performed in South Side clubs and bordello houses before landing her breakthrough engagement at the prestigious Dreamland Café in 1917, where she performed alongside King Oliver and Louis Armstrong. Her career flourished throughout the 1920s and 1930s as she recorded prolifically for major labels including Paramount, Okeh, Victor, and Bluebird, becoming known for her vigorous, rhythmically infectious style and gift for improvising lyrics. She achieved international fame performing in Europe, appearing on Broadway, and recording with jazz legends including Fats Waller, Fletcher Henderson, Eubie Blake, Duke Ellington, and Sidney Bechet.

After decades of performing, Hunter made an unexpected career shift, working as a nurse for twenty years while making only two secret recordings during that period. In 1977, at age eighty-two, she triumphantly returned to the stage at The Cookery nightclub in Greenwich Village, launching a remarkable career revival that exceeded her earlier fame. This comeback led to four well-received albums, including the acclaimed *Amtrak Blues* (1978), performances at Carnegie Hall, and an appearance at the White House for President Jimmy Carter. Hunter continued performing until her death in 1984, leaving behind a legacy as a true jazz pioneer and survivor who demonstrated remarkable resilience and artistry across nearly seven decades.
