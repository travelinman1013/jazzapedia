## Biography
Veronica 'Randy' Crawford was born on February 18, 1952, in Macon, Georgia, and raised in Cincinnati, Ohio, where she began singing in church and performed her first lead vocals with a band featuring Bootsy Collins on bass at age 15. She started club gigs across locations from Cincinnati to Saint-Tropez, gaining prominence in mid-1970s New York by singing with jazz luminaries like George Benson and Cannonball Adderley, and appeared in a 1975 tribute concert with Quincy Jones and Benson. Signing briefly with Columbia Records, she released her debut single 'Knock On Wood' in 1972 and 'Don't Get Caught (In Love's Triangle)' in 1973, marking her entry into R&B and jazz fusion.[1][2][3][4]

Her breakthrough came in 1979 when The Crusaders, led by Joe Sample, invited her to sing lead on 'Street Life,' which topped American jazz charts for 20 weeks, reached #17 R&B and #36 Hot 100 in the US, and #5 in the UK, launching her international career despite greater success in Europe than the US. Follow-up hits included 'One Day I'll Fly Away' (#2 UK, 1980, co-written by Sample and Will Jennings) from *Now We May Begin*, and 'You Might Need Somebody' (1981), with albums like *Secret Combination* (1981) charting for 60 weeks in the UK and 'Almaz' returning her to the UK Top 10 in 1986. She released over 16 solo albums blending jazz, soul, R&B, and pop, won a 1982 Brit Award for Best British Female Solo Artist (despite being American), and earned Grammy nominations in 2007 and 2009 with Joe Sample.[1][2][3][5]

Crawford's legacy endures through her powerful, versatile vocal style and standards like 'Street Life,' re-recorded for films such as *Sharky's Machine* and *Jackie Brown*. She reunited with Sample for albums like *Feeling Good* (2006) and *No Regrets* (2009), toured extensively in Europe, and retired after a stroke cancelled her 2018 farewell concert in South Africa, leaving a half-century impact more celebrated abroad.[2][3][4]
