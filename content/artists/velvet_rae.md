## Biography
Based on available search results, comprehensive biographical information about the musical artist Velvet Rae could not be verified from credible sources. While Spotify metadata indicates Velvet Rae is classified as a soul blues artist with a popularity rating of 32, the search results provided do not contain substantive biographical details about this artist's early life, career development, or musical journey. One search result references a young singer-songwriter (velvetraemusic.com) who is 19 years old and creates indie music with an old soul, but this cannot be definitively confirmed as the same artist referenced in the Spotify data without additional verification.
