# Bob Weir

## Biography
Bob Weir (born Robert Hall Parber on October 16, 1947, later known as Robert Hall Weir) was an American guitarist, singer, and songwriter best known as a founding member of the pioneering jam band the Grateful Dead.[3] Raised in the San Francisco Bay Area after being adopted as an infant, he struggled with dyslexia in school but gravitated early toward music and guitar, which he began playing in his early teens.[3] On New Year’s Eve 1963–64, he met Jerry Garcia at a music store in Palo Alto; the two spent the night playing together and soon formed the jug band Mother McCree’s Uptown Jug Champions, which evolved into the electric band the Warlocks and, by 1965, the Grateful Dead.[1][3] Though only 17 when the Dead began, Weir quickly became central to the group’s sound and stage presence, earning the nickname “the kid.”[1]

Over the Dead’s 30-year run, Weir developed into one of rock’s most distinctive rhythm guitarists, known for his contrapuntal, jazz‑inflected chord voicings and off‑kilter accents that threaded through the band’s improvisations.[1][2][3] He sang and co‑wrote many of the band’s signature rock and country‑influenced songs, including “Playing in the Band,” “Sugar Magnolia,” “Truckin’,” “The Other One,” and “One More Saturday Night,” often in collaboration with lyricist John Perry Barlow.[1][3][4] Weir also pursued parallel projects, releasing solo albums such as *Ace* (1972) and leading or co‑founding bands including Kingfish, Bobby and the Midnites, the Bob Weir Band, RatDog, Furthur (with Phil Lesh), Bob Weir & Wolf Bros, and later Dead & Company, which carried the Dead’s repertoire to new generations starting in 2015.[2][3][4] He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Grateful Dead in 1994 and received Kennedy Center Honors with the band in 2024.[2][3]

Weir’s musical style blended American roots traditions—blues, folk, country & western—with psychedelic rock, improvisational jazz concepts, and an adventurous sense of time and harmony.[1][2][3] His rhythm‑guitar approach, often functioning like a second lead instrument, helped define the Grateful Dead’s elastic, conversational ensemble sound and became a touchstone for jam‑band rhythm players who followed.[1][2] Beyond the Dead, he remained a relentless live performer, participating in various post‑Dead configurations such as The Other Ones, The Dead, Furthur, Wolf Bros, and Dead & Company, and reimagining the band’s songbook in orchestral settings, including a 2025 performance at London’s Royal Albert Hall with the Royal Philharmonic Concert Orchestra.[2][3] Celebrated for more than six decades on the road, Weir emerged as a key architect of the Grateful Dead’s enduring legacy in American music and culture, continuing to tour and record until his passing in January 2026 at age 78.[2][3][4]

## Fun Facts
- Before he was known as Bob Weir, he was born Robert Hall Parber; after being adopted he took the Weir surname, and he later became widely known by the nickname “Bobby.”[3]
- Weir was only 17 years old when the Grateful Dead formed in 1965, leading the rest of the band to call him “the kid” in their early years.[1]
- According to Weir, seeing and hearing the Beatles was the key catalyst that pushed his early jug band with Jerry Garcia to plug in, become the Warlocks, and ultimately transform into the Grateful Dead: “The Beatles were why we turned from a jug band into a rock ’n’ roll band.”[3]
- His 1972 solo album *Ace* is effectively a stealth Grateful Dead record: the entire band played on it, and many of its songs—like “Playing in the Band” and “One More Saturday Night”—became staples of the Dead’s live repertoire.[3][4]
