## Biography
The Casa Loma Orchestra emerged in 1929 from the remnants of The Orange Blossoms, a band run by impresario Gene Goldkette out of Detroit.[1] The musicians were stranded in Toronto after being scheduled to play the grand Casa Loma hotel, which suddenly closed; whether they ever performed there remains unclear.[1] Stranded but determined, the musicians formed an independent, collectively-run corporation under the Casa Loma banner, making it a unique business model for its time.[1][2] By fall 1929, the band had relocated to the Roseland Ballroom in Manhattan and made their first recordings on October 29 for the Okeh label.[4]

During the early 1930s, the Casa Loma Orchestra dominated the dance band field and became one of the most celebrated swing orchestras before the rise of Benny Goodman.[1] The band's cohesion and distinctive sound were forged during 1931-33 through 101 consecutive weeks of one-night stands across America, during which they endured the hardships of the Great Depression, dangerous roads, blizzards, and even an arrest on suspicion of bank robbery in Kentucky.[1][2] Their success stemmed from exceptional musicianship, innovative arranging by Gene Gifford, and a team-oriented spirit with no individual stars.[1] In 1933, saxophonist Glen Gray was elected to manage and front the band, which was then formally incorporated with each sideman becoming a shareholder.[4] The orchestra performed on the first network radio broadcast of Camel Caravan, the foremost swing music program, in December 1933 and sustained this presence until June 1936, significantly shaping the emerging sounds of popular music.[1] The band remained active until 1947 and re-emerged in 1957, with Glen Gray continuing as the most notable leader.[3]

## Fun Facts
- The entire Casa Loma Orchestra band was arrested in Kentucky on suspicion of bank robbery during their 101 consecutive weeks of one-night stands in 1931-33, though the circumstances remain somewhat mysterious.[1][2]
- The Casa Loma Orchestra operated as a cooperative corporation with musicians as shareholders and board members—an extraordinarily progressive business model for the 1930s where members had active votes in management and finances.[1][3]
- The band's name comes from Casa Loma, a grand Toronto hotel where they were scheduled to play in 1927-1929, though it remains unclear whether they ever actually performed there before the hotel closed.[1][4]
- Cornet player Grady Watts described the early years as 'a young football team with a bunch of rookies...blending together, enjoying each other's company,' and one observer called it 'the band that's organized like a corporation and run like a college fraternity.'[1]
