## Biography
The Bad Plus is an American jazz group formed in Minneapolis, Minnesota in 2000, though the members began playing together informally starting in 1989.[2][3] The band was originally conceived as a piano trio featuring pianist Ethan Iverson, bassist Reid Anderson, and drummer Dave King, all hailing from the Midwest (Reid and Dave from Minnesota, Ethan from Wisconsin).[3] From their debut in 2000, The Bad Plus distinguished themselves by refusing to conform to jazz conventions, blending original compositions with unconventional covers spanning genres from ABBA and Nirvana to Aphex Twin and Black Sabbath.[4][5] Their 2001 debut album *Flim* became a watershed moment for redefining the piano trio genre, drawing new audiences to jazz through their brash, clever approach that combined the heart of stadium rock with sophisticated musicianship.[3]

After 27 years as a trio, Ethan Iverson departed the band in 2017 due to differences regarding the production process.[2] Pianist Orrin Evans joined in early 2018, and the band released two acclaimed albums including 2019's *Activate Infinity* on Edition Records.[1] However, in 2021, founding members Reid Anderson and Dave King made a bold creative decision to abandon the piano-trio format entirely, enlisting guitarist Ben Monder (known for work with David Bowie's *Black Star* and other visionary projects) and saxophonist Chris Speed (an award-winning leader of modern ensembles and longtime collaborator with Anderson and King).[1][4] This quartet iteration, unveiled officially in September 2021 at Yoshi's in Oakland, California, represents the band's second major reinvention and marks their most expansive sonic range to date.[4]

Throughout their 26-year history, The Bad Plus have maintained a democratic creative philosophy centered on bridging genres and exploring the infinite possibilities of exceptional musicians working in perfect synchronization.[5][7] The band's evolution reflects their core belief that "evolution is necessary for life and creativity," with each iteration maintaining their original statement while employing completely different instrumentation.[1] Their influence extends across jazz, experimental jazz, jazz fusion, and nu jazz genres, establishing them as one of the most enduring and acclaimed working bands in contemporary jazz.[4]
