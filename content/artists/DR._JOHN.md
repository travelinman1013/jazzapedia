## Biography
Malcolm John Rebennack Jr., better known as Dr. John, was born on November 20, 1941, in New Orleans, Louisiana.[2] Exposed to music from an early age through his father's record and musical-equipment repair shop, Rebennack began his musical journey by observing legendary musicians like Professor Longhair perform in local nightclubs.[5] At age 16, he was hired by Johnny Vincent as a producer at Ace Records, where he gained experience working with artists including James Booker, Earl King, and Jimmy Clanton.[2] While attending Jesuit High School, he formed his first band, The Dominoes, and played in local nightclubs—activities that led to his expulsion from school in 1954.[2] Throughout the late 1950s and early 1960s, Rebennack became a prolific session musician and producer, working on numerous recordings and performing with various bands, though his career was marked by involvement in illegal activities and drug use.

Rebennack's life took a dramatic turn in 1960 when a portion of his left ring finger was shot off in a barroom altercation, forcing him to transition from guitar to keyboards as his primary instrument.[4] Following a narcotics arrest in 1963, he served two years in the Federal Correctional Institution in Fort Worth, Texas.[2] Upon his release in 1965, he relocated to Los Angeles, where he reinvented himself as Dr. John the Night Tripper in 1967, adopting face paint, glitter, and theatrical costumes inspired by medicine shows, Mardi Gras traditions, and voodoo ceremonies.[1][2] His breakthrough came with the release of his album *Gris-Gris* in 1968, which reflected the turbulent social landscape of America and his own chaotic personal experiences.[3] Rebennack went on to record thirty studio albums and nine live albums, achieving mainstream success with the 1973 top-10 hit single "Right Place, Wrong Time."[2] Throughout his nearly five-decade career, he remained rooted in New Orleans musical traditions while drawing on diverse styles, and he continued to be an active performer until his death on June 6, 2019.[2][4]

## Fun Facts
- In 1967, after being exiled from New Orleans due to a drug conviction that forbid him from entering the city, Rebennack reinvented himself as Dr. John the Night Tripper by donning face paint, glitter, and plumes, creating one of rock music's most theatrical personas.[1]
- Rebennack's teenage bands were known for being "always high, always late," yet despite the haze, he simultaneously wore multiple hats as talent scout, A&R man, composer, producer, arranger, session musician, and singer.[1]
- The Dr. John persona was originally invented for another musician, Ronnie Barron, who refused to take on the character—Barron's refusal led to Rebennack adopting the iconic stage name and theatrical style.[1]
- Rebennack developed a self-invented quasi-beatnik/New Orleans language based on the concept of "trickonology," famously summarized in his statement: "Life is always gonna be off the chain, and you can't never hang no jacket on it."[5]
