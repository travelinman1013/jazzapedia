## Biography
Henry Gray (January 19, 1925 – February 17, 2020) was an American blues pianist and singer born in Kenner, Louisiana, who grew up on a farm near Baton Rouge and began playing piano at age eight, initially gospel in church under his deacon father's strict rules, but sneaking blues lessons with his teacher Mrs. White and performing professionally by 16 at local clubs in Alsen.[1][2][4] Self-taught in many ways, he served in World War II, then migrated to Chicago in 1946, immersing himself in the postwar jazz and blues scene, learning from top pianists and gigging while working day jobs.[1][2][3] There, he caught the eye of Big Maceo Merriweather, whose influence refined his style, particularly his left-hand technique, and he transitioned fully to blues after balancing gospel gigs with his Red Devils Trio band for better pay.[1][2][3]

In Chicago from 1946 to 1968, Gray became a cornerstone of the blues world, joining Howlin' Wolf's band in 1956 as his primary pianist for 12 years—Wolf's longest-tenured bandmate—while serving as a prolific Chess Records session musician for stars like Muddy Waters, Sonny Boy Williamson II, Little Walter, Otis Rush, Buddy Guy, Jimmy Reed, and Koko Taylor, helping define the Chicago blues piano sound with its rollicking riffs and turnarounds.[1][2][3][4] In 1968, following his father's death, he returned to Alsen, Louisiana, to support his mother’s fish market and worked as a roofer until 1983, while integrating his big sound into the swamp blues style and recording singles with Whispering Smith.[1][3] From the mid-1980s, he released key albums like *Lucky Man* (1988, Blind Pig Records, produced by Steve Freund), performed at major festivals including New Orleans Jazz & Heritage (nearly every year), Chicago Blues Festival, San Francisco Blues Festival, and European tours, and earned a 2017 Blues Hall of Fame induction and 1999 Grammy nomination for *Tribute to Howlin' Wolf*.[1][2][4]

Gray's legacy endures as a bridge between rural Southern blues and electrified Chicago blues, with over 58-75 albums to his credit across seven decades; scholars note that much of modern blues piano traces back to his blueprint, influencing countless players through his recordings and live prowess.[1][2][3][5]
