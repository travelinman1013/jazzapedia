## Biography
Unable to provide comprehensive biographical information for the artist 'M LUCAS' based on available search results. While the search results reference several musicians with the surname Lucas (Joyner Lucas, Lucas Home, Moyes Lucas, Mark Lucas, Mike Lucas, and Matt Lucas), none of these appear to match the specific artist identifier 'M LUCAS' in the future house genre with a Spotify popularity rating of 57.
