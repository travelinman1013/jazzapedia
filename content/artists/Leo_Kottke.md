## Biography
Leo Kottke, born on September 11, 1945, in Athens, Georgia, experienced a nomadic childhood, moving across 12 different states with his family, which exposed him to diverse musical influences. In Muskogee, Oklahoma, he was particularly drawn to folk and delta blues, especially Mississippi John Hurt, initially learning trombone and violin before switching to guitar at age 11 and developing his distinctive fingerpicking style blending blues, jazz, and folk elements with syncopated, polyphonic melodies.[1][2][7] After a military stint, he settled in Minneapolis in 1966, becoming a regular at the Scholar Coffeehouse, where he recorded his debut *12-String Blues* in 1969 on Oblivion Records, followed by the seminal *6- and 12-String Guitar* (the 'Armadillo album') on John Fahey's Takoma label.[1][3]

Kottke's career gained momentum in the early 1970s with Capitol Records, releasing albums like *Mudlark* (1971), *Greenhouse* (1972), *My Feet Are Smiling* (1973), *Ice Water* (1973), and *Chewing Pine* (1975), which charted in the U.S. top 30 and built an international following through folk festivals.[1][3][4] Despite challenges including partial hearing loss and right-hand tendon damage that nearly ended his career, he persisted, moving to Chrysalis in 1976 and later releasing annual albums from 1989-1991 such as *My Father's Face*, *That's What*, and *Great Big Boy* featuring Lyle Lovett and Margo Timmins, followed by *Peculiaroso* (1993) with Rickie Lee Jones and solo works like *One Guitar, No Vocals* (1999) and *Try and Stop Me* (2004).[1][2]

In his later career, Kottke collaborated extensively with Phish bassist Mike Gordon on *Clone* (2002), *Sixty Six Steps* (2005), and *Noon* (2020), touring in support, while maintaining his reputation as a master of acoustic guitar with a five-decade legacy of innovation in fingerstyle playing.[1][3][4] He has toured with virtuosos like Paco de Lucia and Al Di Meola, and his *Ice Fields* suite for guitar and orchestra marks a milestone in guitar concertos.[7]
