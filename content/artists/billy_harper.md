## Biography
Billy Harper (born January 17, 1943) is an American jazz tenor saxophonist and a living legend of the genre, recognized as one of a generation of Coltrane-influenced saxophonists who built upon the master's work rather than simply copying it.[3][4] Born in Houston, Texas, Harper was immersed in music from infancy, singing solos in church at age three and later at age five at sacred and secular functions.[2][7] He discovered the saxophone at age 11 after admiring one in a store window on his walk home from school, and by age 14 had formed his first Billy Harper Quintet while a student at Evan E. Worthing High School, where he graduated cum laude.[1][2]

Harper attended North Texas State University in 1961, where he studied saxophone and music theory in the prestigious jazz program.[1][2] He progressed through the university's Four, Three, and Two O'Clock Lab Bands before joining the renowned One O'Clock Lab Band in 1964, becoming the first Black performer in the band's history.[1] Under the direction of Leon Breeden, Harper credits his time at North Texas with preparing him for the professional level and the New York jazz scene.[1] After earning his Bachelor of Music degree and completing graduate studies, Harper moved to New York in 1966, where he would achieve legendary status.[2][3]

In New York, Harper quickly attracted attention from jazz giants including Gil Evans, Max Roach, Thad Jones, Mel Lewis, Lee Morgan, and Art Blakey.[2][3] He began a long-lasting association with bandleader and arranger Gil Evans in 1967, served with Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers for two years (1968–1970), and was a member of Max Roach's quartet from 1971–1978.[3][4] His 1973 album *Capra Black*, featuring Elvin Jones on drums, remains a seminal recording of jazz's black consciousness movement, channeling both the intellectual complexity of the avant-garde and the emotional potency of gospel.[4] Harper has recorded nearly two dozen solo albums, toured extensively throughout Europe, Japan, Africa, and the United States, and continues to perform as an active musician well into his eighties, maintaining a distinctively stern, hard-as-nails sound infused with the blues and spiritual depth rooted in his Texas heritage.[1][6][7]

## Fun Facts
- Harper discovered the saxophone at age 11 simply because he liked the way it looked in a store window, and he immediately put it on his Christmas wish list.[1]
- In 1966, Harper was featured on an NBC-TV special called 'The Big Apple' as the jazz musician representative, alongside a boxer (Jerry Quarry), a business person, an opera singer, and a model, showcasing how he would try to sit in with New York musicians.[5]
- Harper's 1973 album 'Capra Black' is considered a seminal recording of jazz's black consciousness movement and remains one of the most important works documenting the spiritual and intellectual dimensions of jazz during that era.[4]
- At age 82, Harper continues to perform with remarkable vitality, leading his classically arranged quintet and maintaining the powerful, emotional playing style that has defined his six-decade career.[6]
