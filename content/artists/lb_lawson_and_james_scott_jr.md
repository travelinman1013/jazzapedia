## Biography
L.B. Lawson and James Scott Jr. were a blues duo active in the early 1950s, known for their recordings with the pioneering Sun Records label in Memphis, Tennessee. James Scott Jr., born in 1913 in Lexington, Mississippi, United States, developed a local reputation as a guitarist leading his band, the Blues Rockers. He passed away in 1983 in Chicago, Illinois. Little is documented about L.B. Lawson's early life, but he served as the vocalist for the Blues Rockers alongside Scott's guitar work.

In approximately January 1952, the duo, as part of the Blues Rockers, recorded several tracks for Sun Records, including 'Scott's Boogie,' 'Flypaper Boogie,' and 'Got My Call Card.' These sessions captured their raw blues rock sound during the label's formative 'Blues Years' from 1950-1958, though the recordings were not commercially released at the time. Their style aligned with the gritty, boogie-infused blues emerging from the Mississippi Delta region, reflecting Scott's hometown roots.

Limited information exists on their later careers or broader legacy, with no evidence of extensive discography or major commercial success. Their contributions represent an early, obscure chapter in Sun Records' history, predating the label's rockabilly fame, and highlight the blues talent scouted by Sam Phillips before Elvis Presley.
