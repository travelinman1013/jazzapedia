## Biography
Matthew 'Hogman' Maxey was an African American blues musician known for his work in traditional folk and country blues styles, primarily recorded while incarcerated at Angola Prison in Louisiana. In 1938, he began playing guitar for the Greenville Pepper Shakers, performing at house parties, bar rooms, and country suppers, marking the start of his early career in the regional blues scene.[1] His music gained wider recognition through recordings made in the 1950s by LSU English professor Dr. Harry Oster, who captured performances by prisoners at the infamous Angola facility.[3]

Maxey's style stood out for its unique harmonic approach, notably employing polytonality—a rare practice in blues harmony—alongside raw, emotive tracks like 'Stagolee,' 'Black Night Is Fallin',' 'Worried Blues,' and 'Fast Life Woman,' featured on the Smithsonian Folkways album *Angola Prisoners' Blues*.[3][4] Discovered by Oster alongside other notable inmates such as Robert Pete Williams and Guitar Welch, Maxey's prison recordings highlighted the gritty country blues tradition born from hardship.[2][3] In the 1960s and 1970s, he performed at several festivals, bringing his Angola-era sound to broader audiences.[2]

Maxey's legacy endures through these archival recordings, preserving the voices of Angola prisoners and showcasing an unconventional blues artistry shaped by incarceration. His contributions remain a testament to the resilience of blues musicians within the prison system, influencing folk and blues preservation efforts.[2][3]
