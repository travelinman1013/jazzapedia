## Biography
Jean Batiste "J.B." Fuselier (April 17, 1901 – August 16, 1976) was a pioneering Cajun musician who became one of the few artists in his genre able to sustain a career through music alone. Born in Oberlin, Louisiana, Fuselier began playing fiddle at age five, initially so small he had to lie on a bed to play the instrument. He started accordion at a young age as well, and by nine years old was already performing at dances. His early career flourished in the 1930s when he recorded extensively with Victor Records under banjoist Beethoven Miller's Merrymakers, eventually leading his own group, J.B. and His Merrymakers, which drew large crowds at venues like the Step Inn Club in Lawtell and Fais Do Do in Ville Platte.

Fuselier's career spanned nearly five decades and was marked by significant innovations in Cajun music. Most notably, he is credited with being the first to incorporate the steel guitar into Cajun music by hiring Atlas Frugé to play in his band. He recorded for multiple labels including Bluebird, Folkways, and Goldband, and his compositions became standards in the Cajun repertoire. His three most famous songs—"Ma chère Bassette," "Jongle à Moi," and "Chère Tout-Toute" (written for his daughter)—have been covered by numerous musicians. A tragic accident in 1955 claimed the life of his collaborator Iry LeJeune when a car struck their vehicle while Fuselier was changing a tire; despite suffering a collapsed lung and multiple broken bones, Fuselier continued performing with his Merrymakers until his death in 1976.
