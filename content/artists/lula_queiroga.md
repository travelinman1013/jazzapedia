## Biography
Luiz de França Guilherme de Queiroga Filho, known as Lula Queiroga, was born on March 17, 1960, in Recife, Brazil, into a musically rich family—his father was journalist and composer Luís Queiroga, and his mother was singer Meves Gama.[1] He relocated to Rio de Janeiro in the 1980s, where he established himself as a multifaceted artist working across music, poetry, cinema, and visual arts. In 1983, he recorded his debut album "Baque Solto" in partnership with Lenine on the Philips label, which featured his compositions "Êxtase" and "Essa Alegria" (the latter recorded by Elba Ramalho), immediately establishing his presence in the Brazilian music scene.[1]

Throughout his career, Lula Queiroga has worked as an independent artist, releasing five solo albums: "Aboiando A Vaca Mecânica" (2001), "Azul Invisível e Vermelho Cruel" (2004), "Tem Juízo Mas Não Usa" (2009), "Todo Dia é O Fim do Mundo" (2011), and "Aumenta o Sonho" (2015).[1] Beyond his solo work, he has composed numerous songs for prominent MPB (Música Popular Brasileira) artists and collaborated extensively with musicians including Pedro Luís, Marcelo Falcão, Zé Renato, Arnaldo Antunes, and Braulio Tavares.[1] He is also a founding partner of Luni Produções, a production and publishing company, and was instrumental in creating the multimedia project "Falange Canibal" alongside Mu Chebabi, Lucky Luciano, Fernando Piancó, and Ivan Santos.[1]

Lula Queiroga's artistic identity is characterized by his ability to blend multiple cultural and musical genres, creating what has been described as an "electrorganic" sound.[2] His work spans rock, pop, and Latin influences, and he has contributed to various media including graphic novels and film.[3] As a songwriter, his compositions have been recorded by major names in Brazilian music, cementing his role as both a performer and influential composer within the contemporary MPB landscape.[3]
