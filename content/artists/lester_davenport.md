## Biography
Lester 'Mad Dog' Davenport (January 16, 1932 – March 17, 2009) was an American Chicago blues harmonica player and singer born in Tchula, Mississippi. He moved to Chicago in 1945 at age 14, where he immersed himself in the local blues scene, learning from Arthur 'Big Boy' Spires, Snooky Pryor, and Homesick James, who invited him to jam sessions and tutored him on harmonica.[1][3][5] Davenport's early career included gigs with Spires and James, followed by a notable stint with Bo Diddley in the 1950s, contributing harmonica to the 1955 Chess session that produced 'Pretty Thing' and 'Bring It to Jerome,' and performing at New York's Apollo Theater.[1][2]

During the 1960s, Davenport led his own band while working a day job as a paint sprayer on Chicago's West Side, maintaining activity in the blues circuit. In the 1980s, he joined Big Daddy Kinsey & the Kinsey Report, solidifying his reputation as a harmonica player with a powerful, traditional Chicago blues style known for its sweet tone and perfect phrasing.[1] His solo recognition came later with albums like Earwig's *When the Blues Hit You* (1992), featuring him prominently, and Delmark's *I Smell A Rat*, alongside contributions to other artists' records such as Aron Burton's *Live* and Jack Johnson's *Live in Chicago*.[1]

Davenport retired from music around 2007 and passed away in Chicago on March 17, 2009, from prostate cancer. Renowned for his warm personality, humor, and willingness to mentor aspiring harmonica players, his legacy endures through his tenacious stage presence and contributions to Chicago blues.[1]
