## Biography
Jon Cleary, born August 11, 1962, in Cranbrook, Kent, England, discovered his passion for music early, starting on guitar at age five and forming his first band, Delta Wing, at 16 with blues guitarist Roger Hubbard. Inspired by his uncle's records of New Orleans artists like Professor Longhair, he left school after art studies and moved to New Orleans in 1981 at age 19. His first job was painting the Maple Leaf Bar, where he soon transitioned to playing piano, immersing himself in the city's R&B and funk scene.[1][2][3][4]

Cleary's career took off as a session musician for New Orleans legends including Earl King, Johnny Adams, Walter ‘Wolfman’ Washington, Snooks Eaglin, Ernie K-Doe, Jessie Hill, and as a guitarist for Dr. John. He released his debut album *Alligator Lips & Dirty Rice* in 1989, formed Jon Cleary & The Absolute Monster Gentlemen, and toured with icons like Bonnie Raitt (for a decade, contributing five songs), Taj Mahal (who covered four of his compositions), B.B. King, Eric Clapton, and others. His band, featuring core members Cornell C. Williams (bass), Thomas Glass or A.J. Hall (drums), and expandable to include Nigel Hall, Pedro Segundo, and Xavier Lynn, released six albums, with *Go Go Juice* winning a Grammy in 2016 for Best Regional Roots Music Album.[1][2][3][5]

Renowned for his mastery of New Orleans piano, funk, and R&B—blending blues, jazz, soul, and Afro-Cuban influences—Cleary has earned OffBeat awards, Gambit 'Best Of's, the 2017 Ascona Jazz award, and 2020 JazzFM 'Best International Blues Act.' Based in New Orleans' Bywater for over 40 years, he continues performing worldwide, teaching styles via PianoGroove, and upholding the Crescent City's musical legacy.[1][2][3][4]
