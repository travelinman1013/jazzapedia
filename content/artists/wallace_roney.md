## Biography
Wallace Roney (May 25, 1960 – March 31, 2020) was an American jazz trumpeter born in Philadelphia who became one of the most significant voices in hard bop and post-bop jazz. Discovered to have perfect pitch at age four, Roney began his musical training at Philadelphia's Settlement Music School under Sigmund Hering, trumpeter for The Philadelphia Orchestra. He made his recording debut at age 15 and became the youngest member of the Philadelphia Brass Ensemble at age 12. After his parents' divorce, he moved to Washington, D.C., where he enrolled in the Duke Ellington School of the Arts, a pivotal institution that shaped his early development. He continued his education at Howard University and Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts.

Roney's professional career accelerated dramatically in the mid-1980s after meeting Miles Davis in 1983 at a tribute event in Manhattan. This connection proved transformative—Davis personally mentored Roney from 1985 until Davis's death in 1991, making Roney the only trumpet player Davis formally mentored. In 1986, Roney joined Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers, succeeding Terence Blanchard, and simultaneously became an integral member of Tony Williams's quintet in the late 1980s and early 1990s. His debut album as a leader, *Verses*, was released on Muse Records in 1987. By age 40 in 2000, Roney had appeared on over 250 audio recordings and recorded more than a dozen albums as a leader across labels including Warner Bros. Records and Concord Records.

Praised by *Time* magazine for his "amber tone and patient and considered phrasing," Roney became one of the leading figures of the Young Lions Movement in the 1980s. He won a Grammy Award for the 1992 tribute album *A Tribute to Miles*, recorded with Davis alumni Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter, Ron Carter, and Tony Williams. Despite critical comparisons to his mentor Miles Davis, Roney demonstrated versatility and innovation, incorporating Brazilian rhythms, strings, and fusion elements into his compositions. His later work, including albums like *Village* (1997) and *No Room for Argument* (2000), showcased his evolution toward a jazz/bop/urban fusion sound. Roney passed away on March 31, 2020.
