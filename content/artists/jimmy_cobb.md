## Biography
Wilbur James "Jimmy" Cobb was born on January 20, 1929, in Washington, D.C., and became one of jazz's most accomplished and understated drummers. Largely self-taught, Cobb began his professional career in the late 1940s, initially performing with saxophonist Charlie Rouse in Washington before relocating to New York at age twenty-one. His early work included engagements with Earl Bostic, Billie Holiday, Dinah Washington, Pearl Bailey, Dizzy Gillespie, Cannonball Adderley, and Stan Getz, during which he developed a mature, adaptable style influenced by bebop pioneers Max Roach and Kenny Clarke. His propensity for subtle, understated playing and his preference for avoiding publicity meant he did not achieve the same level of recognition as some contemporaries, despite his exceptional musicianship.

Cobb's most significant contribution to jazz came when he joined Miles Davis in 1958 as part of the First Great Sextet, recommended by Cannonball Adderley. Between 1957 and 1963, he played on some of Davis's most celebrated recordings, including the masterpiece *Kind of Blue* (1959)—the most popular jazz recording in history—as well as *Sketches of Spain*, *Someday My Prince Will Come*, *Live at Carnegie Hall*, *Live at the Blackhawk*, and *Porgy and Bess*. During this period, he formed a formidable rhythm section with pianist Wynton Kelly and bassist Paul Chambers. After leaving Davis in 1962, Cobb continued to work prolifically, including touring and recording with guitarist Wes Montgomery and later forming the Wynton Kelly Trio, which remained active until Paul Chambers's death in 1969.

Cobb remained active as a performer and recording artist well into his later years, earning an NEA Jazz Masters Fellowship in 2009 and releasing albums including *So Nobody Else Can Hear* (1983), *Only For The Pure Of Heart* (1998), *Cobb's Corner* (2007), *The Original Mob* (2014), and *This I Dig Of You* (2019). He was the last surviving musician from the *Kind of Blue* sessions for nearly three decades after Miles Davis's death in 1991. Cobb passed away on May 24, 2020, at age 91, leaving behind a legacy as one of jazz's most reliable, tasteful, and influential accompanists.

## Fun Facts
- Cobb was the last surviving musician from the *Kind of Blue* sessions for nearly three decades after Miles Davis's death in 1991, holding this distinction until his own passing in 2020.
- Despite his monumental contributions to jazz history, Cobb's subtle and understated demeanor meant he did not achieve the same level of recognition as fellow drummers, and he did not record his first album as a bandleader until 1983—more than 30 years into his professional career.
- Cobb left Miles Davis's band in 1962 and recorded *Boss Guitar* with Wes Montgomery the very next day, demonstrating his continued demand as a session and touring musician.
- Largely self-taught, Cobb developed his mature playing style through work in rhythm and blues bands that emphasized shuffle rhythms and backbeats, particularly under bandleader Earl Bostic, before transitioning to bebop and modal jazz.
