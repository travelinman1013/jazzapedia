## Biography
Pete "El Conde" Rodríguez (January 31, 1933 – December 1, 2000) was a legendary salsa singer born in Barrio Cantera, Ponce, Puerto Rico. After military service, he returned to New York and honed his musical skills performing with bands including La Oriental Cubana and Los Jóvenes Estrella de Cuba. His career trajectory changed dramatically when Dominican bandleader Johnny Pacheco spotted him singing at the Bronx club Los Panchos and invited him to join his ensemble. This partnership became one of the most significant in Latin music history, beginning with their 1963 collaboration on *Suavito* for the Alegre label and solidifying with the 1964 release of *Cañonazo*, the inaugural album on the newly founded Fania Records label.

Throughout the 1960s and early 1970s, Rodríguez and Pacheco recorded seven albums together, including *La Perfecta Combinación* (1970), *Los Compadres* (1971), and *Tres De Café Y Dos De Azúcar* (1973), establishing themselves as architects of modern salsa music. Rodríguez's distinctive vocal style—marked by his majestic interpretation of boleros and rootsy conjunto arrangements—made him Pacheco's favorite vocalist. In 1974, he embarked on a solo career with his self-titled debut *El Conde*, which Pacheco produced as musical director, featuring memorable tracks like the autobiographical "El Conde Negro" and "Fiesta En El Cielo." His solo output during the mid-to-late 1970s, including *Este Negro Sí Es Sabroso* (1976) and *A Touch of Class* (1977), showcased his versatility as a performer.

During the 1980s, as Fania All-Stars faced decline, Rodríguez reunited with Pacheco to record four additional albums between 1983 and 1989, including the 1987 Grammy-nominated album *Salsobita*. His career exemplified the evolution of Latin music from Cuban charanga traditions to the modern conjunto format, and his partnership with Pacheco helped establish salsa as a dominant force in global popular music. Rodríguez's legacy endures as a defining voice of the salsa era and a testament to the creative synergy between two musical titans.

## Fun Facts
- Pacheco, who worked with renowned singers including Celia Cruz, Rolando Laserie, and Héctor Casanova, has always stated that El Conde was his favorite singer, demonstrating the exceptional regard in which he held Rodríguez's vocal talents.
- The 1964 album *Cañonazo* marked a pivotal moment in Latin music history—it was not only Rodríguez's first Fania release but also the label's inaugural recording, and it documented Pacheco's momentous transition from Cuban charanga to the traditional conjunto format.
- Despite leaving Pacheco's band in 1974 to pursue a solo career, the split was remarkably amicable; Pacheco himself served as musical director on Rodríguez's solo debut album, an unusual arrangement that reflected their mutual respect and artistic partnership.
