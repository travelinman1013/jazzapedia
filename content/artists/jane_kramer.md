## Biography
Jane Kramer is an accomplished folk-Americana singer-songwriter from Asheville, North Carolina, known for her sultry vocals and lyrically eloquent songwriting rooted in Appalachian musical traditions.[2] She began her professional music career as a founding member, guitarist, vocalist, and songwriter of The Barrel House Mamas, an all-female Appalachian folk ensemble that toured nationally from 2003 to 2010.[2][3] After experiencing significant personal upheaval—including the dissolution of a 12-year partnership, the loss of a close friend, and a miscarriage—Kramer relocated to Portland, Oregon, where she lived on a houseboat and wrote the material for her debut solo album, Break & Bloom, released in 2013.[2][3]

Kramer's musical style is characterized by introspective, gracefully gritty songwriting that explores themes of resilience, grief, loss, and human connection.[2][3] Her second solo album, Carnival of Hopes, was released in February 2016 and earned critical acclaim, establishing her as a distinctive voice in contemporary folk music.[2] Her third album, Valley of the Bones (2018), emerged from a place of deep emotional processing and represents her artistic evolution toward self-love and storytelling beyond personal experience.[3][8] Beyond her recording career, Kramer has become deeply committed to music as a tool for healing and social change, teaching songwriting in prisons, rescue missions, programs for at-risk youth, hospitals, and animal shelters.[2]

Kramer's work has garnered international recognition, with UK music reviewers describing her as sounding like she was "born to gypsy poets and raised by Emmylou Harris."[2][6] She maintains a loyal following spanning from Portland, Oregon to Scotland, and continues to perform in listening rooms, theaters, festivals, and arts venues across North America and internationally.[2] Her career reflects a deliberate integration of artistic expression with humanitarian work and social advocacy.

## Fun Facts
- Kramer grew up outside Philadelphia in a Jewish family that observed both Jewish and Christian holiday traditions, but didn't feel a true sense of home until attending Warren Wilson College in North Carolina, where she bonded with the women who would become The Barrel House Mamas.[3]
- During a period of profound personal crisis, Kramer lived on a houseboat in Portland, Oregon while writing her debut solo album, Break & Bloom, though she felt the songs were so deeply rooted in Asheville that she returned to the city just to hold the album-release party.[3]
- Beyond music, Kramer has worked as a social worker and former domestic violence crisis counselor, and she now devotes significant time to teaching songwriting in unconventional settings including prisons, rescue missions, hospitals, and animal shelters as a form of healing and community engagement.[2]
- The title track of her 2018 album Valley of the Bones emerged from a dream in which Kramer discussed a miscarriage with a deceased friend, representing her artistic processing of grief and her journey toward self-love and wholeness.[3]
