## Biography
Paul Alton "Lil' Buck" Sinegal (often spelled Senegal due to a long‑standing passport error) was born on January 14, 1944, in Lafayette, Louisiana, in a Creole family where music was part of daily life.[1] His mother, Odette Broussard, played guitar, and by the late 1950s he was performing locally with artists such as Carol Fran, James "Thunderbird" Davis, Lee Dorsey, and Joe Tex, after his father bought him his first electric guitar on installments.[1][3] In 1959 he formed his first band, the Jive Five, followed in the early 1960s by Little Buck and the Top Cats, a powerful horn‑driven R&B and soul outfit that became one of southwest Louisiana’s dominant live bands and even hosted a weekly Saturday afternoon TV show.[3] During this period he began recording blistering guitar instrumentals such as "Monkey in a Sack" and "Cat Scream" for the La Louisianne label, establishing his reputation as a fiery, modern guitarist steeped in blues and Gulf Coast R&B.[1][3]

Sinegal’s national and international profile grew dramatically after he joined Clifton Chenier’s Red Hot Louisiana Band in 1969–72, becoming a key architect of the modern zydeco guitar style through the 1970s and helping define how electric guitar fits alongside accordion in zydeco.[1][3][5] Urged by Chenier to deepen his command of blues, he immersed himself in B.B. King’s recordings, refining a searing, vibrato‑rich, blues‑inflected approach that blended urban blues phrasing with Creole rhythms and funk undercurrents, a sound that later critics and fellow musicians hailed as quintessential Louisiana guitar.[3][5] After leaving Chenier’s band in the early 1980s, he toured and recorded extensively with Rockin’ Dopsie and then with Stanley “Buckwheat” Dural Jr. (Buckwheat Zydeco) into the early 2010s, while also leading his own bands, including the Cowboy Stew Blues Revue.[1][3][5] He released leader albums such as *The Buck Starts Here* (1999), produced and largely written by Allen Toussaint, and *Bad Situation* (2002), appeared on Paul Simon’s Grammy‑winning album *Graceland*, and became a staple of the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival and the Ponderosa Stomp, backing dozens of classic soul, blues, and zydeco artists.[1][2][3] Inducted into the Louisiana Blues Hall of Fame in 1999 and the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame in 2013, Sinegal remained a patriarch of the Lafayette scene until his death on June 10, 2019, leaving a legacy as one of the most important zydeco and Louisiana blues guitarists of his generation.[1][2][3]

## Fun Facts
- The spelling "Sinegal" instead of his family name "Senegal" originated from a passport error that he never bothered to correct, so the misprint became his professional surname.[1]
- As leader of Little Buck and the Top Cats in the 1960s, he was so popular in southwest Louisiana that he hosted his own weekly Saturday afternoon TV show on a local station, a rare platform for a regional R&B band at the time.[3]
- Eric Clapton once referred to him as "the best blues guitarist alive," a testament to how highly other guitar greats regarded his playing.[2]
- His Lafayette home on St. Charles Street functioned as a community hub for decades, where musicians dropped by for lessons, jam sessions, stories, and crawfish boils, making his front porch an informal blues school.[2][3]
