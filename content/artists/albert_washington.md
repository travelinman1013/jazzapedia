# Albert Washington

## Biography
Albert Washington (August 17, 1935 - October 23, 1998) was born in Georgia and moved with his family to the greater Cincinnati area, where he began his musical journey singing in the gospel group the Gospelaires. A self-taught musician, he crafted his own guitar and mastered wind instruments, eventually securing a house band gig at Cincinnati's Vets Inn that lasted around 15-16 years starting in the late 1950s. His career took off with his first secular R&B recording for Finch in 1958, followed by a deal with Fraternity Records, where he recorded notable tracks as Albert Washington and the Kings, achieving regional hits and airplay.[1][2][5]

## Fun Facts
- Washington was entirely self-taught, talented enough to build his own guitar and play wind instruments.
- His 1968 single 'I'm The Man' became a worldwide club dance favorite, particularly in the New Breed R&B scene.
- Complications from diabetes led to deteriorating vision in the 1970s, causing him to scale back his career until a 1990s revival.
- He co-created the Preston record label in the late 1970s with blues historian Steve Tracy.
