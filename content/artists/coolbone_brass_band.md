## Biography
Coolbone Brass Band is a New Orleans–based ensemble that fuses the city’s brass‑band street tradition with hip‑hop, R&B, and acid‑jazz aesthetics. Emerging amid the wave of modern brass bands that followed groups like Dirty Dozen and Rebirth Brass Band, Coolbone developed a sound that keeps the classic second‑line horn lineup but layers it with rap, funk grooves, and contemporary production ideas.[1][3][6] Sometimes billed simply as **Coolbone** or as **Coolbone Swing Troupe**, the band reflects the musical versatility of its founders and their grounding in both traditional New Orleans music and more modern Black popular styles.[2][3][5]

Led by trombonist and producer **Steven “Coolbone” Johnson**, the band has included several of his family members, notably co‑founder and fellow trombonist **Ronell Johnson**, who has spoken of Coolbone as a “family band.”[3][4][5] Across albums such as *Brass-Hop*, Coolbone have pursued a stylistic hybrid sometimes labeled “brass‑hop,” using the raw timbre of horns and second‑line rhythms as a platform for rap verses and R&B‑tinged hooks.[6][8] While they have not reached the mainstream visibility of some New Orleans brass bands, their work is frequently cited in discussions of younger groups that expanded the brass‑band vocabulary by incorporating hip‑hop and funk, positioning Coolbone as part of the broader evolution from traditional parade bands toward club‑ and studio‑oriented hybrids in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.[1][3][6][8]

In this context, Coolbone’s legacy lies less in chart success and more in their role as one of several New Orleans ensembles that helped normalize and codify the fusion of brass‑band horn lines with hip‑hop beats and flows. Their recordings and live performances stand alongside those of contemporaries like the Soul Rebels and other “funk/rap”–leaning brass bands mentioned in surveys of the New Orleans scene, marking Coolbone as a contributor to an ongoing lineage of stylistic experimentation rooted in the city’s parade traditions.[1][3][6] Due to limited publicly available documentation, many details of the band’s early years and later activities remain under‑reported in mainstream reference sources.
