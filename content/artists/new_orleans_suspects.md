## Biography
The New Orleans Suspects formed in 2009 as a pick-up band called The Unusual Suspects at the Maple Leaf Bar in New Orleans, bringing together some of the city's most seasoned and respected musicians. Initially a local favorite, they transitioned to full-time touring by summer 2011, dropping 'New Orleans' from their name and quickly drawing large crowds across the U.S., from San Francisco to New York. Their sound fuses New Orleans funk, brass band traditions, boogie-woogie piano, rock, jazz, blues, and R&B, often compared to Little Feat meets swamp rock, with high-energy performances designed to fill dance floors.[1][2][3][5][6]

The band's core revolves around principal songwriters and vocalists Jake Eckert (guitar) and CR Gruver (keys), supported by a rotating rhythm section including drummers like Eddie Christmas, Willie Green, and Edward Christmas, bassists Eric Vogel, Charlie Wooton, and founding member Reggie Scanlan (who left due to illness), and saxophonists like Brad Walker and Jeff Watkins. They have released at least five full-length albums since 2011, including their self-titled debut, live album 'Caught Live at the Maple Leaf' (2012), 'Ouroboros' (2014), and 'Kaleidoscoped' (around 2016), with a sixth planned for 2023, earning praise from outlets like Village Voice, The New Yorker, and San Diego Union Tribune for their deep-rooted New Orleans groove.[1][2][3][4]

Recognized as standard bearers of New Orleans music by Jazzfest founder Quint Davis, the Suspects have become festival staples and have contributed to the community by organizing benefits for the New Orleans Musicians Clinic, inspired by Scanlan's health challenges. Their music features compelling originals alongside tasteful covers, showcasing the versatility of members with pedigrees from Dirty Dozen Brass Band, The Meters, James Brown, and more, ensuring a legacy as a premier export of NOLA's funky heritage.[2][3][4]
