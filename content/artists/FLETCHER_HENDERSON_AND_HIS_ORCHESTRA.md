## Biography
James Fletcher Hamilton Henderson, born on December 18, 1897, in Cuthbert, Georgia, grew up in a middle-class African-American family and studied music from an early age, initially pursuing chemistry before accidentally entering the music industry as a song demonstrator in New York City with Black Swan Records around 1920. He formed the Fletcher Henderson Orchestra in the early 1920s during the Harlem Renaissance, starting as a dance band that evolved into a pioneering jazz ensemble, securing residencies at venues like Club Alabam and the Roseland Ballroom from 1924, where it gained fame as New York's top African-American band[1][2][3][4][6]. Henderson's musical style blended intricate arrangements with improvisation, bridging Dixieland and swing eras through expanded big band instrumentation—three trumpets, two trombones, and saxophone sections—featuring hot solos and call-and-response riffs, largely crafted by arranger Don Redman[1][2][3][7].

The orchestra's golden era in the 1920s and early 1930s showcased talents like Louis Armstrong (1924-1925), Coleman Hawkins, Benny Carter, Charlie Green, Joe Smith, and later Roy Eldridge, Chu Berry, and Sid Catlett, producing hits like 'Sugar Foot Stomp' and 'King Porter Stomp'[1][2][3][4][5][6]. Despite financial struggles, leadership issues, and band breakups (notably 1929 and 1939), Henderson sold arrangements to Benny Goodman in 1934, fueling Goodman's success, and reformed bands intermittently until a 1950 stroke; he died on December 29, 1952, in New York[2][3][4][5][6].

Henderson's legacy as the 'Birthplace of Swing' and architect of big band jazz endures, having established the saxophone as a solo instrument, innovated orchestration, and shifted jazz's center from New Orleans/Chicago to New York, influencing the swing era alongside Duke Ellington[1][2][3][5][7]. Inducted into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame in 1989, his work laid foundational arrangements for future big bands[4].
