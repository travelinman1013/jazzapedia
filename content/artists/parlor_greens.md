## Biography
Parlor Greens is a supergroup organ trio formed in 2023, consisting of guitarist Jimmy 'Scratch' James from Seattle, organist Adam Scone from New York, and drummer Tim Carman from Boston. The project originated when Carman and Colemine Records founder Terry Cole discussed their admiration for classic organ combo records from labels like Blue Note and Prestige, leading Cole to assemble the trio for the inaugural session at his new Portage Lounge Studio in Loveland, Ohio. Upon arriving, the musicians experienced instant chemistry: within ten minutes of plugging in, they wrote and recorded their first track, 'West Memphis,' marking the spontaneous birth of Parlor Greens and their debut album *In Green/We Dream*.[1][2][3][6]

Jimmy James, the rhythmic backbone of the group, brings decades of experience from Seattle's soul scene, having co-led The True Loves and served as the original guitarist for the Delvon Lamarr Organ Trio. His style emphasizes groove and pocket, influenced by his early days playing drums and lessons from his late mother (a singer who stressed melody and rhythm) and sister (a drummer who taught tempo discipline). Adam Scone, a veteran of the soul revival with Daptone Records, studied under soul jazz legends like Melvin Sparks and Dr. Lonnie Smith, delivering masterful organ work. Tim Carman, known for his blues shuffles with GA-20, provides a steady, funky pocket. Their sound channels 1960s organ-guitar-drums masters like Dr. Lonnie Smith, Melvin Sparks, and Bernard 'Pretty' Purdie, blending retro soul, funk, and jazz into danceable instrumentals.[1][2][3][5]

The trio's music reflects personal resilience, recorded amid individual tragedies but emerging as a joyful collaboration. Parlor Greens represents a pinnacle for these veterans, with James noting it as potentially his finest hour, prioritizing rhythm that 'drives the locomotive' over leads to create feel-good grooves that evoke nostalgia and escape.[1][3][5]
