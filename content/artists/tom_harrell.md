## Biography
Tom Harrell was born on June 16, 1946, in Urbana, Illinois, and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area from age five. He began playing trumpet at age eight, inspired by Louis Armstrong and Benny Goodman recordings in his parents' collection, and was performing in jazz groups by age 13. After graduating from Stanford University in 1969 with a degree in music composition, Harrell launched his professional career touring with Stan Kenton's orchestra (1969) and Woody Herman's Thundering Herd (1970–1971), followed by work with the Latin big band Azteca (1972). Despite experiencing schizophrenia symptoms since adolescence, Harrell pursued an exceptionally prolific career as both a performer and composer.

Harrell gained significant recognition as a trumpet soloist in hard-bop combos, most notably with pianist Horace Silver (1973–1977), where he recorded five albums, and with saxophonist Phil Woods (1983–1989), with whom he made seven albums. During these periods, he also collaborated with jazz luminaries including Bill Evans, Lee Konitz, Bob Brookmeyer, Gerry Mulligan, and Charlie Haden's Liberation Music Orchestra. His improvisational style is characterized by lyrical, vibratoless phrasing and facility across traditional and experimental jazz idioms. Beginning in the late 1980s, Harrell emerged as a prolific leader, recording prolifically for Contemporary Records (now Concord), Chesky, and RCA/BMG (1996–2003), producing albums ranging from large ensemble works to smaller group configurations.

Throughout his career, Harrell has been recognized with numerous accolades, including multiple Trumpeter of the Year awards from DownBeat magazine, the Jazz Journalists Association Trumpeter of the Year (2018), a Grammy Award nomination for his big band album Time's Mirror, and the Prix Oscar du Jazz. His compositions have been recorded and performed by diverse artists including Carlos Santana, the Vanguard Jazz Orchestra, and the Afro-Latin Jazz Orchestra. As of 2026, Harrell remains an influential figure in contemporary jazz, celebrated for his creative compositions, sophisticated arrangements, and distinctive trumpet voice.
