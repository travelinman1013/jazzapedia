## Biography
Beach House is an American dream pop band formed in 2004 in Baltimore, Maryland, by French-born vocalist and keyboardist Victoria Legrand and Baltimore native guitarist Alex Scally. The duo met in their early 20s while working on a different musical project and began creating their hazy, ethereal sound, releasing their self-titled debut album in 2006 on Carpark Records, which charmed indie music enthusiasts with tracks like 'Apple Orchard.' Their music draws from 1990s dream pop and shoegaze influences such as Cocteau Twins and My Bloody Valentine but avoids heavy guitar effects, instead emphasizing organ, guitar, and Legrand's evocative vocals.[1][2][3]

The band's career evolved with subsequent releases: *Devotion* (2008), the breakthrough *Teen Dream* (2010) on Sub Pop Records, which brought universal acclaim and marked them as indie leaders with refined hooks and live drums, followed by *Bloom* (2012), *Depression Cherry* and *Thank Your Lucky Stars* (both 2015), *7* (2018) co-produced by Sonic Boom of Spacemen 3, and *Once Twice Melody* (2022). Signing to Sub Pop brought clarity to their lo-fi origins, establishing them as synonymous with dream pop revival, dominating genre discussions and spiking Google search interest with each album.[1][2][7]

Beach House's legacy lies in reinventing dream pop for new generations through consistent innovation within their style, outlasting many indie peers in a male-dominated scene, with Legrand's voice becoming emblematic of 2010s indie music. They emphasize organic songcraft over genre labels, fostering fan interaction via initiatives like city-specific setlists.[1][4][6]
