## Biography
Sublime is an American reggae rock and ska punk band formed in 1988 in Long Beach, California, by Bradley Nowell (vocals and guitar), Eric Wilson (bass), and Bud Gaugh (drums), who met during high school and bonded over music, surfing, and punk influences like the Minutemen.[1][2][3][6] The trio began jamming in Gaugh's garage, covering songs before developing their signature blend of punk rock, reggae, ska, and hip-hop, with early gigs sparking chaotic events like the 1988 'Peninsula Riot' at their first show on July 4th.[1][2] They self-released their debut album *40oz. to Freedom* in 1992 on Skunk Records, selling 30,000 copies from their van, building a grassroots following through Southern California parties, clubs, and college radio despite initial limited commercial success.[1][2][6]

The band's career peaked with the 1996 self-titled album, featuring hits like 'What I Got,' but tragedy struck when Nowell died of a heroin overdose on May 25, 1996, just days before a major tour, leading to the original lineup's breakup.[1][3][5] Nowell's dalmatian, Lou Dog—named after his grandfather and often joining them onstage—became the band's mascot.[3][4][5] Posthumously, Sublime's music gained massive popularity, resonating with a generation through its rebellious spirit and eclectic style. In 2009, Wilson and Gaugh reformed as Sublime with Rome alongside vocalist Rome Ramirez, releasing albums like *Yours Truly* before legal issues with Nowell's estate forced the name change; Gaugh later departed.[1][4] Recently, the band resurrected with Nowell's son Jakob Nowell on vocals alongside Wilson and Gaugh.[1]

Sublime's legacy endures through billions of streams, influencing ska punk and reggae rock, with their innovative genre fusion and raw energy leaving an indelible mark on music history.[1][4]
