## Biography
Martin Luther King Jr. (born Michael King Jr. on January 15, 1929, in Atlanta, Georgia) grew up in a middle-class family as the son of a Baptist minister, developing an early interest in music by enjoying opera and playing the piano. He built a large vocabulary through reading dictionaries and excelled in public speaking during high school, winning an oratorical contest in 1944 with a speech decrying racial chains on Black America. Skipping the ninth grade and entering Morehouse College at 15, King pursued studies in English and sociology, honing his orotund baritone voice on the debate team while showing little interest in grammar or spelling[1][9].

King's career as a civil rights leader and Baptist minister emphasized **spoken word** as his primary 'musical' style—powerful orations blending rhythmic cadence, biblical rhetoric, and poetic repetition, akin to gospel preaching. His style evolved through non-violent activism inspired by Gandhi, leading to landmark speeches like the 1963 'I Have a Dream' address at the March on Washington, improvised with gospel singer Mahalia Jackson's prompting. This 17-minute delivery drew a quarter-million diverse attendees, marking the largest Washington protest gathering then[1][6].

King's legacy endures through his words' activism impact, influencing social justice art, spoken word, rap, and poetry. Assassinated on April 4, 1968, in Memphis, his speeches continue inspiring artists channeling his non-violence and equality message, as seen in modern creatives using hip-hop and visual arts for change[1][2].
