## Biography
Charles Mingus Jr. (April 22, 1922 – January 5, 1979) was born on a military base in Nogales, Arizona, and raised in Watts, California, where he was exposed to diverse musical influences through church choir singing and radio broadcasts of Duke Ellington. His formal musical training included five years of double bass study with H. Rheinshagen, principal bassist of the New York Philharmonic, and compositional techniques with the legendary Lloyd Reese. Beginning his professional career in the 1940s, Mingus toured with major jazz ensembles led by Louis Armstrong, Kid Ory, and Lionel Hampton before establishing himself in New York's jazz scene.

By the 1950s, Mingus had become one of the most significant figures in twentieth-century American music, playing and recording with jazz luminaries including Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, Bud Powell, Art Tatum, and Duke Ellington himself. In 1952, he co-founded Debut Records with Max Roach to document his growing body of original compositions and support young, unrecorded musicians. Mingus pioneered collective improvisation—drawing from New Orleans jazz traditions—and carefully assembled unconventional instrumental configurations based on both musicians' technical skills and personalities. His compositional output was prolific, encompassing over three hundred scores and more than one hundred recorded albums.

Mingus's musical innovations spanned from advanced bebop and avant-garde jazz to post-bop and progressive big band experiments, with seminal recordings including Pithecanthropus Erectus (1956), Mingus Ah Um (1959), and The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady (1963). In 1977, he was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), which eventually confined him to a wheelchair, yet he continued recording by singing into a tape recorder until his death in January 1979. His legacy remains foundational to modern jazz, with his emphasis on collective improvisation and unconventional ensemble configurations continuing to influence musicians across generations.

## Fun Facts
- Mingus wrote his first concert piece, 'Half-Mast Inhibition,' at age seventeen, but it was not recorded until twenty years later by a 22-piece orchestra conducted by Gunther Schuller.
- Despite being primarily known as a bassist, Mingus was an accomplished pianist who could have made a career playing that instrument alone.
- In May 1953, Mingus participated in a historic Massey Hall concert in Toronto with Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker, Bud Powell, and Max Roach—the last recorded documentation of Gillespie and Parker playing together.
- Mingus was nominated for a Grammy Award only three times during his lifetime, with one nomination for Best Original Jazz Composition for 'The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady' (1962), despite his prolific output of over three hundred compositions.
