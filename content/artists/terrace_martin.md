## Biography
Terrace Jamahl Martin, born December 28, 1978, in Los Angeles, California, emerged from the Crenshaw neighborhood, immersing himself in jazz and hip-hop from a young age. A multi-instrumentalist proficient in saxophone, keyboards, drums, and more, he gained early recognition playing with the World Stage All-Stars led by jazz drummer Billy Higgins and touring with Puff Daddy and Kirk Franklin's God's Property, rejecting the starving artist stereotype to pursue mainstream success. His production career took off with a Power 106 radio drop featuring Snoop Dogg, leading to credits on Snoop's albums *R&G (Rhythm & Gangsta): The Masterpiece* (2004) and *Ego Trippin'* (2008), as well as the 213 track 'Joysticc.' Martin's style fuses funk, jazz, soul, hip-hop, and R&B, emphasizing deep bass lines that evoke neighborhood protection and sensuality, rooted in influences like Herbie Hancock, Miles Davis, Q-Tip, and Mac Dre.

Martin's breakthrough came through close collaboration with Kendrick Lamar, contributing to every album from *Section.80* (2011) to *DAMN.* (2017), including the pivotal *To Pimp a Butterfly* (2015), which he helped develop and which cracked open new possibilities in hip-hop akin to Duke Ellington's impact. In 2016, he launched his artist-first label Sounds of Crenshaw, inspired by Snoop Dogg's welcoming backstage vibe, releasing his Grammy-nominated album *Velvet Portraits* through Ropeadope Records, featuring Kamasi Washington, Thundercat, Robert Glasper, Lalah Hathaway, and his father Curly Martin on drums. A Grammy-nominated producer, rapper, singer, and engineer, Martin continues working with artists like Herbie Hancock, YG, SZA, and Fergie, positioning himself as a servant to his community through genre-bending music that promotes joy, healing, and freedom.

His legacy lies in bridging jazz's communal roots with modern hip-hop, creating a 'new neo soul' movement alongside figures like Kendrick Lamar and Chance the Rapper, while fostering emerging talent via his label centered on Crenshaw's diverse sounds.
