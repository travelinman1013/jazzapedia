## Biography
New Orleans Willie Jackson (1896 or 1897 – after 1930) was an American blues and jazz singer active primarily in New Orleans, Louisiana, and New York City during the 1920s. Little is known about his early life beyond his birth in Louisiana, where he emerged in the vibrant New Orleans music scene, performing blues, jazz, and comic numbers in a versatile, vaudevillian style featuring strong dance rhythms and double entendres.[1][5][6] He gained local prominence singing at venues like Spanish Fort in New Orleans alongside pianist Steve Lewis, with whom he frequently collaborated.[1]

Jackson's career peaked in the mid-1920s with phonograph recordings for Columbia Records between 1926 and 1928, capturing his energetic vocal performances on tracks like 'How Long,' 'She Keeps It Up All the Time,' and the first recording of 'T.B. Blues,' later popularized by Victoria Spivey.[1][4] He also contributed vocals to King Oliver's Dixie Syncopators band, bridging blues and jazz traditions. His output appeared on various New Orleans blues and jazz anthologies, showcasing his role in early 20th-century Black music circuits.[1][5] After 1930, his activities fade from record, leaving a legacy as a spirited entertainer of the era.[1]

Known occasionally as 'The Big Boy With The Big Voice,' Jackson occasionally performed in blackface and promoted local businesses like Brown's ice cream shop, reflecting the performative demands of the time.[1][6]
