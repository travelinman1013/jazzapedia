## Biography
Prince Far I (born Michael James Williams) was a legendary Jamaican reggae artist and deejay who emerged as one of the most distinctive voices in roots reggae during the 1970s.[1][2] Born in Spanish Town, Jamaica in 1945, he grew up in the Waterhouse area of Kingston, where he attended sound system dances that inspired his early career.[2][4] He began his professional journey as lead DJ with the Sir Mike the Musical Dragon Sound System, later working as security at Studio One under producer Coxsone Dodd.[1][2] His deep, resonant voice and innovative chanting style—which he preferred to call "chanting" rather than "toasting"—earned him the nickname "The Voice of Thunder."[1][2]

Prince Far I's recording career took off in the early 1970s with producers like Bunny Lee and Coxsone Dodd, but his artistic vision crystallized with his 1975 debut album *Psalms for I*, produced by Lloydie Slim.[2][3] This groundbreaking work featured biblical recitations over heavy rhythms and established his unique style as both spiritually committed and sonically innovative.[2][3] Throughout the late 1970s and early 1980s, he released numerous albums including *Under Heavy Manners* (1976), *Message from the King* (1978), and the influential *Cry Tuff Dub Encounter* series, which he produced himself on his own Cry Tuff label.[1][3] His music consistently addressed social issues affecting Jamaica while maintaining strong Rastafarian themes and spiritual messages.[1][3] Prince Far I's last recorded performance was in Manchester, England in 1982 with the band Suns of Arqa, documented on his album *Musical Revue*.[1] He passed away on September 15, 1983, in Kingston, Jamaica, while working on the album *Umkhonto We Sizwe* with producer Roy Cousins.[1]

## Fun Facts
- Prince Far I preferred to call himself a 'chanter' rather than a 'toaster,' distinguishing his vocal style and approach to reggae music from other deejays of his era.[1]
- His debut album *Psalms for I* was specifically dedicated to people who couldn't read the Bible themselves, as he recited biblical passages over heavy reggae rhythms.[1]
- Prince Far I recorded a track called 'Virgin' for On-U Sound Records that humorously criticized Richard Branson and Virgin Records' treatment of him as an artist.[2]
- He established his own record label, Cry Tuff, in 1976 with the subtitle 'Wisdom Man,' through which he released many of his self-produced works and maintained creative control over his music.[2][3]
