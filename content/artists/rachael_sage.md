## Biography
Rachael Sage is a New York City-based singer-songwriter, producer, visual artist, and founder of her own independent record label, MPress Records, established in 1996 to release her debut album 'Morbid Romantic.' Her early passion for music emerged around age 5 during sleep-away camp in Maine, where she substituted as piano accompanist for a talent show, realizing the social power of her piano skills; she began writing original songs at that age and recording on a 4-track by age 12. A teen winner of the ASCAP Pop Songwriting Contest, she received a demo offer from producer Tony Visconti, though her parents insisted she pursue college first, delaying her full music career.[1][6]

After college, Sage moved back to NYC, released albums like 'Smashing The Serene,' and gained traction by charting on college radio alongside artists like Jewel and Sarah McLachlan. Writing a song for Ani DiFranco led to a tour opening slot for her, exposing Sage to large folk audiences and accelerating her growth; subsequent tours included Lilith Fair and support for Eric Burdon and The Animals. Over two decades, she has released at least 12 solo albums and EPs on MPress, signed other artists, produced five volumes of the charity compilation 'New Arrivals,' and earned accolades including six Independent Music Awards and a John Lennon Contest Grand Prize. Prior to music, she trained at the School of American Ballet and danced professionally with the New York City Ballet.[1][2][5][6][7]

Sage's musical style blends innovative singer-songwriter elements with piano-driven folk-pop, characterized by charisma and unique production; she handles album art, promotion, and touring hands-on in her early indie days, building a dedicated fanbase through North American and European tours alongside artists like Sarah McLachlan, Judy Collins, Marc Cohn, Jamie Cullum, and A Great Big World. Her legacy as a self-made artist emphasizes persistence, independence, and mentorship in the indie scene, inspiring others through her multifaceted career and refusal to stop creating.[1][3][4]

## Fun Facts
- At age 5, Sage substituted as piano accompanist at sleep-away camp in Maine when the regular musician fell ill, leading campers in songs and sparking her professional identity.[1]
- She was a professional dancer, training at the School of American Ballet and performing with the New York City Ballet before fully committing to music.[6]
- Sage faked having a full label staff in her early days by using a fax machine and signing press kits with a fictional manager's name, which helped her chart quickly on college radio.[1]
- She has released 12 albums and EPs on MPress, produced charity compilations, and considers her greatest achievement simply never stopping writing songs.[1]
