## Biography
Sharon Redd was born on October 19, 1945, in Norfolk, Virginia, into a highly musical family; her father Gene Redd served as a producer and music director at King Records, her stepfather performed with Benny Goodman's orchestra, her brother Gene Redd Jr. was a writer and producer for Kool & The Gang and BMP, and her half-sister Pennye Ford became an R&B singer with Snap![1][2][5]. She launched her recording career in 1968 with four singles on United Artists, including tracks produced by Bobby Susser, and gained acting prominence starring in the Australian production of the rock musical 'Hair' from 1969 to 1971, which led to TV specials and ads[1][2]. Redd also appeared in London's 'The Wedding of Iphigenia' in 1974, the TV sitcom 'Rhoda,' and joined Bette Midler's backup trio, the Harlettes, after a rigorous audition process[1][2].

Signing with Prelude Records, her most successful era began in 1980 with her self-titled debut album, featuring hits like 'Can You Handle It' (#5 on Billboard Disco Top 100) and 'You Got My Love'; this was followed by 'Redd Hott' (1981, #59 UK Albums) with tracks such as 'Beat The Street,' 'Never Give You Up' (#20 UK Singles), and 'In The Name Of Love' (#31 UK), all topping Billboard's Dance/Disco chart for a week[1][2][4]. Her 1983 album 'Love How You Feel' included the title track (#16 Billboard Dance) and 'Liar On The Wire' (#39 Dance), blending post-disco, boogie, and R&B elements that kept the disco flame alive into the house era[1][2]. Later singles like 'Undercover Girl' (1985) and a 1992 remix of 'Can You Handle It' (#17 UK) marked a brief comeback, but she primarily worked as a backup vocalist with groups like Two Tons featuring Luther Vandross and Jocelyn Brown[1][2].

Redd passed away on May 1, 1992, at age 46 from pneumonia, reportedly AIDS-related after an onstage injury weakened her immune system; her vocals appeared posthumously on Pennye Ford's 1993 duet 'Under Pressure'[1][2]. Her legacy endures as a Prelude Records icon and disco diva, honored in Black History Month exhibits and by the National AIDS Memorial, influencing club DJs with her song-based R&B dance classics[2].
