## Biography
The African Brothers International Band was a Ghanaian highlife band formed in 1963 and inaugurated at the Park Cinema Theater in Adabraka, Accra.[1] Led by Nana Kwame Ampadu (born March 31, 1945, in Obo Kwahu, eastern Ghana), the band emerged from Ampadu's early street performances with his guitar in Accra during 1961-1962.[1][2] The group's formation involved collaboration with Eddie Donkor and other musicians who pooled instruments, including locally made jazz drums and congas, to create their initial ensemble.[1]

The African Brothers achieved their first major commercial success in 1967 with the single "Ebi Tie Ye" ("Some Are Sitting Well"), which addressed themes of social inequality and became a theatrical production.[2] Between 1968 and 1978, the band recorded approximately 400 single tracks and released over 50 LPs, establishing themselves as one of Ghana's most popular bands.[2][3] The ensemble typically comprised up to 12 musicians, including four guitarists creating intricate layered arrangements, backed by percussionists, vocalists, and keyboards.[3] Under Ampadu's leadership as singer, guitarist, arranger, and composer, the band pioneered innovative dance styles including the Tinawele dance, Afrohili beat, and Afro-reggae—a fusion of highlife and reggae.[2]

The band's popularity extended internationally, with tours to the United States, Canada, and Europe beginning in 1976.[2] Their recordings became available in the UK and USA through labels including Makossa and Rounder Records, with notable albums such as "Agatha" (1981), "Me Poma" (1984), and "Obi Doba" (1985).[3] Ampadu became recognized as a defender of highlife heritage and an active participant in musicians' unions, while the band's socially conscious lyrics and entertaining performances maintained their relevance across decades.[3]
