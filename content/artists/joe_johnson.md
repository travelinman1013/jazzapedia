# JOE JOHNSON

## Biography
Joe Johnson, originally from the small community of Morgantown in southern Mississippi, developed a lifelong passion for music from an early age, lying on the floor under his mother’s piano as she rehearsed songs for Sunday morning services. His musical style defies strict categorization, blending Country, Blues, Americana, Texas shuffles, Pop, Rock, and Soul, all rooted in his southern heritage, with a focus on deeply personal lyrics and storytelling that captivate listeners in diverse venues from theaters to roadhouses.[1][6]

Johnson launched his career as a solo songwriter in 2001 in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, before relocating to Manitou Springs, Colorado in 2003, where he co-formed the band Creating a Newsense. The band enjoyed a successful seven-year run, opening for acts like Ollabelle, Split Lip Rayfield, Blue Mountain, and Rusted Root, and performing at festivals such as the 2008 Wakarusa Festival. After the band's 2010 dissolution, he resumed solo work with his 2011 debut album 'A Time to Dance' on Blank Tape Records, followed by the breakthrough 'New West Sound' in 2013. He expanded with independent releases, extensive touring, and opening for artists like The White Buffalo, Radney Foster, Asleep at the Wheel, Junior Brown, and Lukas Nelson, while sharing stages with Ray Wylie Hubbard and Todd Snider.[1]

In 2018, Johnson released 'Morgantown' featuring his band The Wildfire and guests like Kenny Brown, Grant Sabin, Bryant Jones, and Jason Miller. From 2019 to 2024, he taught songwriting at the Colorado Springs Conservatory while writing extensively, producing a highly appreciated acoustic album showcasing fingerstyle guitar and lyrical depth, popular internationally in places like Ireland, the UK, Germany, France, and Brazil. His 2023 live album 'One Man Show,' recorded at Meadowgrass Music Festival, marked further growth. Currently based in Colorado Springs, Colorado, he continues with projects including work with The Thieves and The Wildfire, exploring Rock, Blues, Country, and piano-driven music.[1][6]

## Fun Facts
- Joe Johnson's dogs were named Cletus and Willie Nelson, inspiring the playful song 'Cletus and Me and Willie Nelson' featuring Jason Miller's vocals on the 'Morgantown' album.[1]
- His recent acoustic album, recorded solo with just voice, guitar, and a tapping cowboy boot on a wood board, gained a cult following abroad in Ireland, UK, Germany, France, and Brazil despite being intentionally unmarketable.[1]
- Todd Snider was so moved by a Joe Johnson & The Wildfire performance that he spontaneously joined them onstage for a Jerry Jeff Walker song.[1]
- Johnson taught songwriting at the Colorado Springs Conservatory for five years (2019-2024) while raising his two kids through high school and writing new material.[1]
