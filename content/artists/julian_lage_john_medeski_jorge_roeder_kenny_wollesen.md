# Julian Lage, John Medeski, Jorge Roeder, Kenny Wollesen

## Biography
Julian Lage, John Medeski, Jorge Roeder, and Kenny Wollesen are a jazz-rooted quartet configuration built around the long-running collaborations of guitarist Julian Lage with bassist Jorge Roeder and drummer Kenny Wollesen, augmented at times by keyboardist and organist John Medeski. American guitarist and composer Julian Lage was born in Santa Rosa, California, in 1987 and gained attention as a child prodigy, becoming the subject of the Oscar‑nominated short documentary *Jules at Eight* and performing with Carlos Santana and vibraphonist Gary Burton before his teens.[4][5][6] By age 12–13 he appeared on the Grammy Awards telecast, and at 15 he joined the faculty of the Stanford Jazz Workshop and recorded with Burton, setting the stage for a career that would bridge jazz, classical, bluegrass, and roots music.[2][3][4][6] Lage’s leader debut *Sounding Point* (2009) established him as a major new guitar voice, followed by albums such as *Gladwell*, *Arclight*, *Modern Lore*, and *Love Hurts*, which showcased a highly melodic, rhythmically agile style that draws on bebop, country swing, early rock & roll, and American folk idioms.[1][2][3] In 2021 he signed with Blue Note Records, releasing *Squint*, *View With a Room*, *The Layers*, and *Speak to Me*, further solidifying his reputation as one of the most influential guitarists of his generation.[1][2][4]

Peruvian-born bassist Jorge Roeder, a key member of Lage’s ensembles since at least the early 2010s, brings a deep grounding in jazz, classical, and Latin traditions; he anchored Lage’s early quintet on *Gladwell* and later the working trios heard on *Love Hurts* and subsequent tours.[1] Drummer Kenny Wollesen, an American percussionist associated with John Zorn and the New York downtown scene, joined Lage and bassist Scott Colley on *Arclight* and *Modern Lore*, giving those albums their loose, playful but precise rhythmic drive and contributing to Lage’s move toward twangier electric textures and early rock & roll influences.[1][2][3] Keyboardist John Medeski, best known from the group Medeski Martin & Wood, has intersected with members of this circle through the broader avant‑jazz and improvising community, sharing affinities for groove‑based improvisation, organ‑driven textures, and genre‑blurring composition, even when not a fixed member of Lage’s regular touring trio. Collectively, the work of Lage with Roeder and Wollesen, and their occasional wider associations with figures like Medeski, exemplifies a contemporary jazz aesthetic that treats American roots music, new music, and free improvisation as a single, fluid language, influencing a younger generation of guitarists and improvisers who look to this group’s recordings as models of lyricism, interplay, and modern guitar‑trio design.[1][2][3][4]

## Fun Facts
- Julian Lage was the subject of an Oscar‑nominated documentary short, *Jules at Eight*, which chronicled his life and playing when he was only eight years old.[4][6]
- Before he turned 10, Lage had already performed onstage with Carlos Santana and Gary Burton, placing him in professional settings typically reserved for established artists.[5][6]
- At around 12–13 years old, Lage performed at the Grammy Awards in a youth jazz band, a moment that directly led to his mentorship and subsequent recordings with Gary Burton.[2][3][4]
- Lage has said he rarely transcribes solos note‑for‑note; instead, he prefers to internalize the spirit and phrasing of his favorite players, having only fully transcribed two solos in his life according to a JazzTimes profile.[3]

- [[kenny_wollesen|Kenny Wollesen]] - Drummer who helped define the sound of Lage’s early electric trios with a loose, swinging, and rock‑inflected feel. (Drummer on *Arclight* (2016) and *Modern Lore* (2018), part of Lage’s trio with bassist Scott Colley.) [2016–2018 (and associated touring)]

- [[charles_lloyd|Charles Lloyd]] - Saxophonist with whom Lage has recorded and performed, further broadening his exposure within modern jazz. (Collaborative work with Lloyd’s ensembles (Lage is credited on Lloyd projects as a guest guitarist).) [2010s–2020s]

### Artists Influenced
- [[younger_contemporary_jazz_and_acoustic_guitarists|Younger contemporary jazz and acoustic guitarists]] - Lage’s blend of prodigious technique, genre‑fluid repertoire, and melodic focus is widely cited in criticism as a model for emerging guitarists, positioning him as an alternative to the dominant post‑Rosenwinkel harmonic style. (Albums such as *Sounding Point*, *Arclight*, *Modern Lore*, and *Squint* serve as reference points for modern jazz and roots‑inflected guitar playing.) [2010s–present]
