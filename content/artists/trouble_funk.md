# Trouble Funk

## Biography
Trouble Funk is a pioneering go-go and funk band formed in the late 1970s in Washington, D.C., widely recognized as one of the key groups that defined and popularized the go-go sound beyond the city’s borders.[1][2][5] Emerging from D.C.’s vibrant club and cabaret scene, the band fused upbeat 1970s funk with a 1960s-style horn section, heavy percussion, and extended, party-focused jams that emphasized audience participation and call-and-response.[1][3] Led by bassist, vocalist, and bandleader Tony “Big Tony” Fisher—alongside core early writers such as keyboardists Robert “Syke Dyke” Reed and James Avery and trumpeter Taylor Reed—Trouble Funk developed a high-energy live show that became central to the identity of go-go, a genre often described as a more percussion-driven, locally rooted cousin of hip‑hop.[1][3]

The band first broke through regionally with their club performances and early singles, then nationally with albums like *Live* (1981), *Drop the Bomb* (1982), *In Times of Trouble* (1983), and *Saturday Night Live* (1983), released on labels including Jamtu, Sugar Hill, D.E.T.T., and Island Records.[2][3] Their anthems such as “Hey, Fellas” and “Drop the Bomb” became staples of the go-go canon and were heavily sampled in hip‑hop, helping to link D.C.’s scene with the broader Black music landscape.[2][3] Throughout the 1980s the group toured widely across the United States and internationally, playing venues from Madison Square Garden and the Apollo Theater to the Montreux Jazz Festival, and sharing bills with acts ranging from punk bands Minor Threat and the Big Boys to funk and rock artists like Parliament-Funkadelic, Red Hot Chili Peppers, UB40, Def Leppard, and Fishbone.[1][2] Their raw, party-driven sound and relentless touring earned them a reputation as global ambassadors of go-go, and they have remained an enduring live attraction while continuing to represent Washington, D.C.’s homegrown groove on stages around the world.[1][3][6]

## Fun Facts
- Trouble Funk originally stumbled onto their breakthrough go-go groove while trying to play Kraftwerk’s “Trans-Europe Express”; the jam they created instead became their song “Roll with It,” the first tune that reliably kept audiences dancing all night.[3]
- Before he was a well-known bandleader, Tony “Big Tony” Fisher was playing bass in clubs as a teenager—sometimes with musicians twice or three times his age—then going to high school exhausted the next morning because the gigs paid too well to turn down.[3]
- Trouble Funk is one of the few go-go bands that regularly shared stages with hardcore punk groups like Minor Threat and the Big Boys, making them an unlikely bridge between Washington, D.C.’s Black club scene and its punk underground.[1][2][3]
- The band’s relentless touring schedule in the mid‑1980s took them from iconic U.S. venues like Madison Square Garden and the Apollo Theater to major European stops and the Montreux Jazz Festival, helping establish them as global ambassadors for go-go music.[1]

## Musical Connections

### Mentors/Influences
- [[chuck_brown|Chuck Brown]] - A slightly older D.C. bandleader whose go-go sound and live approach formed the template and competitive benchmark for groups like Trouble Funk; they opened for him early on and vied with him for the top spot in the local go-go hierarchy. (Early live battles and double‑bills at D.C. venues; Brown’s recordings such as “Bustin’ Loose” provided a stylistic model for live, percussion‑heavy go‑go.) [Late 1970s–1980s (club era and early touring years)]

### Key Collaborators
- [[tony_big_tony_fisher|Tony “Big Tony” Fisher]] - Founding bassist, vocalist, bandleader, and key songwriter who shaped the band’s sound and front‑man style, guiding the group’s recordings and tours. (Core role across *Live*, *Drop the Bomb*, *In Times of Trouble*, *Saturday Night Live*, *Say What!*, *Trouble Over Here, Trouble Over There* and later compilations.) [Late 1970s–present[1][2][3][6]]
- [[robert_syke_dyke_reed|Robert “Syke Dyke” Reed]] - Keyboardist, songwriter, and early co‑leader whose playing and writing helped define the dense, keyboard‑driven go‑go grooves of the band. (Part of the original writing team on early Trouble Funk material, including the period around *Live* and *Drop the Bomb*.) [Late 1970s–1980s[1][7]]
- [[james_avery|James Avery]] - Keyboardist and member of the original songwriting nucleus, contributing to the band’s harmonic and rhythmic framework. (Early studio and live releases such as *Live* and *Drop the Bomb*.) [Early 1980s[1][7]]
- [[taylor_reed|Taylor Reed]] - Trumpeter in the horn section and part of the early writing team, helping establish the prominent brass sound in Trouble Funk’s arrangements. (Early 1980s singles and albums including the *Drop the Bomb* era.) [Early–mid 1980s[1][7]]
- [[kurtis_blow|Kurtis Blow]] - New York rapper with whom Trouble Funk recorded, creating a bridge between go-go and early hip‑hop on record and video. (Collaborated and appeared with him on the track and video “I’m Chillin’.”) [Mid‑1980s[1][3]]
- [[bootsy_collins|Bootsy Collins]] - Iconic funk bassist and producer who worked with Big Tony in the context of Trouble Funk’s late‑1980s output, reinforcing the band’s connection to classic P‑Funk lineage. (Collaboration around the album *Trouble Over Here, Trouble Over There*.) [Late 1980s[3]]
- [[minor_threat|Minor Threat]] - Hardcore punk band from D.C.; sharing stages with them highlighted Trouble Funk’s crossover appeal to punk audiences and the city’s interlinked underground scenes. (Joint live bills and tours rather than recorded collaborations.) [Early–mid 1980s[1][2][3]]
- [[big_boys|Big Boys]] - Texas punk/funk band that co‑billed with Trouble Funk, underscoring the band’s reception among alternative and punk crowds. (Shared live shows and festival stages.) [1980s[1][2]]

### Artists Influenced
- [[eu_experience_unlimited_rare_essence_and_other_d.c._go-go_bands|EU (Experience Unlimited), Rare Essence, and other D.C. go-go bands]] - Peers and successors within the D.C. go-go scene who both competed with and drew from Trouble Funk’s high‑energy, percussion‑heavy performance style and extended jams, helping define what a go-go show should feel like. (Live performance practices and arrangements across their 1980s go-go catalogues; influence seen more in show format and groove than in specific recorded covers.) [1980s–1990s (peak go-go era)[3][5]]
- [[hip-hop_producers_and_artists_using_trouble_funk_samples|Hip-hop producers and artists using Trouble Funk samples]] - Numerous hip‑hop acts sampled Trouble Funk’s breaks and grooves, incorporating D.C. go-go rhythms into rap tracks and thus extending the band’s influence into recorded hip‑hop. (Sampling of tracks like “Drop the Bomb” and other grooves (exact songs often cited in sample databases rather than primary sources).) [Mid‑1980s onward, especially the late 1980s–1990s sampling era[3][6]]
- [[international_festival_and_collegetown_funk_scenes|International festival and college‑town funk scenes]] - Through extensive U.S. college touring and appearances at major festivals (including Montreux Jazz Festival), Trouble Funk exposed non‑D.C. audiences and local bands to go-go, influencing regional funk and jam‑band approaches to long‑form dance music. (Live tours in Europe, Japan, and U.S. college circuits rather than specific recordings.) [Mid‑1980s–1990s[1][3][6]]
