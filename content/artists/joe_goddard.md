## Biography
Joe Goddard was born in London in 1979 and emerged as a pivotal figure in early 2000s electronic music.[5] He began making beats at age 14 using CoolEdit and samples from the Isley Brothers, initially creating tracks for schoolmates with rap aspirations.[1] At age 11, Goddard met Alexis Taylor at a south London school, and this friendship would prove foundational to his career. After attending Oxford University, Goddard and Taylor collaborated on lo-fi bedroom productions before officially launching Hot Chip in the early 2000s.[2] The band's breakthrough came with their 2004 debut album *Coming On Strong* through Moshi Moshi Records, which established them as innovators blending indie sensibilities with dance music conventions.[1][2]

Beyond Hot Chip, Goddard has cultivated a multifaceted career as a producer, remixer, and DJ. He co-founded The 2 Bears with Raf Rundell, creating a fusion of ragga 2-step and deep New York house music that earned significant dancefloor credibility.[2] Goddard also co-heads the Greco-Roman label and club night, positioning himself as what one source describes as "London's premier producer for hire."[3] His remix work has been particularly influential, transforming tracks like Nneka's "Shining Star" into nine-minute dance compositions that bridge soul and house traditions.[1] Throughout his career, Goddard has maintained a philosophy of artistic eclecticism, refusing to be confined to single genres and instead drawing from London's diverse musical heritage spanning jungle, garage, house, and techno.[3]

Goddard's legacy extends across multiple dimensions of electronic and indie music. Hot Chip achieved Mercury Prize nominations and produced hit singles including "Over and Over" and "Ready for the Floor," with their discography spanning six albums beyond the debut.[2][5] His work as a solo artist includes the album *Electric Lines* released through Greco-Roman.[4] Goddard has also released three solo albums and continues to balance his roles as band member, label head, producer, and father, living in Kent with his family.[5] His influence stems from his ability to synthesize disparate musical traditions—from R&B and soul to dance and techno—into cohesive artistic statements that have shaped indie-dance music's trajectory since the early 2000s.
