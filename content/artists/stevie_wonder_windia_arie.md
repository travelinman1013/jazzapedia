# Stevie Wonder w/India Arie

## Biography
Stevie Wonder, born Stevland Hardaway Morris on May 13, 1950, in Saginaw, Michigan, became blind shortly after birth due to retinopathy of prematurity. Discovered as a child prodigy by Motown Records at age 11, he signed with the label and released his debut album *Little Stevie Wonder the 12-Year-Old Genius* in 1963. His early career featured hits like 'Fingertips' and evolved through adolescence with albums blending R&B, soul, and funk, showcasing his multi-instrumental talents on harmonica, piano, drums, and synthesizer. By the 1970s, Wonder gained creative control, producing landmark albums such as *Talking Book* (1972), *Innervisions* (1973), and *Songs in the Key of Life* (1976), which fused soul, jazz, funk, and social commentary, earning him 25 Grammy Awards and widespread acclaim as one of the greatest musicians of all time.

The collaboration 'Stevie Wonder w/India Arie' primarily refers to their duet on the title track 'A Time to Love' from Wonder's 2005 Motown album *A Time to Love*, co-written by Arie and nominated for a Grammy for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals. India Arie, born India Arie Simpson on October 3, 1975, in Denver, Colorado, and raised in Atlanta, Georgia, emerged in the neo-soul scene with her 2001 debut *Acoustic Soul*, which went double platinum. Her mother, Joyce Simpson, a Motown singer who opened for Wonder, connected Arie to his influence; Arie toured with Wonder early in her career, learning from him about life and music during around 80 shows. Their partnership highlights neo-soul's bridge to Wonder's soul legacy.

Wonder's musical style innovated with synthesizers and socially conscious lyrics addressing civil rights, poverty, and spirituality, influencing generations. His legacy includes induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (1989), Presidential Medal of Freedom (2014), and over 100 million records sold worldwide. Arie's acoustic, introspective neo-soul style echoes Wonder's emotional depth, cementing their shared impact on contemporary R&B.
