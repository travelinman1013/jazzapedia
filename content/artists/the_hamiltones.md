## Biography
The Hamiltones are a Grammy-nominated soul and R&B vocal trio from North Carolina, consisting of J. Vito, Tony Lelo, and 2E (also known as 2E from Greensboro). Hailing from areas like Morrisville, Greensboro, and Charlotte, the group members grew up in musical families deeply rooted in the church, where their fathers served as pastors and music ministers, fostering early exposure to gospel music. They developed their harmonies and 'Young Vintage' style—a blend of vintage soul with a modern swagger, characterized by heartfelt, down-home North Carolina singing—through local scenes and open mics alongside artists like Fantasia and K-Ci & JoJo.[1][3][4][6]

The trio formed in 2016 after initially backing Anthony Hamilton as background vocalists, following the departure of BJ the Chicago Kid and Jack 'JK' King; they were introduced to Hamilton via music director Kenny Leonard and gained viral attention through social media covers filmed by Lavan Anderson, including the infamous 2016 Birdman 'Put Some Respeck' incident on The Breakfast Club. This led to their breakout collaboration 'What I'm Feelin'' with Hamilton in 2018, earning a Grammy nomination, international tours with Hamilton and Ry Cooder, and features on Grammy-nominated projects like PJ Morton's 'Everything's Gonna Be Alright,' Jonathan McReynolds' 'Graduate,' and Tori Kelly's 'Hiding Place' (a 2019 winner). They released their debut EP 'Watch The Ton3s' independently, emphasizing their rarity in a synth-heavy era by relying on raw vocal prowess.[1][3][4][5][6]

Their legacy continues as independent torchbearers of Carolina soul, expanding into Americana, blues, and folk influences from tours like Freight Train Blues honoring Elizabeth Cotten, while maintaining humility amid global travels, including an emotional Africa tour with Hamilton that connected them to their heritage. Residing across North Carolina, they blend gospel roots with broad musical explorations, earning acclaim for masterful harmonies and authentic passion.[1][3][4]
