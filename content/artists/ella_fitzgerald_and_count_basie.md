# ELLA FITZGERALD AND COUNT BASIE

## Biography
“Ella Fitzgerald and Count Basie” is not a single fixed ensemble but rather the historic pairing of two towering jazz figures—vocalist Ella Fitzgerald and bandleader/pianist Count Basie—whose collaborations became benchmarks of big band swing and vocal jazz. Fitzgerald, born in Newport News, Virginia and raised in Yonkers, New York, first became famous in the 1930s with drummer Chick Webb’s orchestra at Harlem’s Savoy Ballroom, scoring a breakthrough hit in 1938 with “A‑Tisket, A‑Tasket,” which stayed on the pop charts for weeks and launched her national reputation.[4][5] After Webb’s death in 1939 she briefly led the band as Ella and Her Famous Orchestra before moving into a solo career that embraced swing, bebop, and the Great American Songbook, aided by producer and manager Norman Granz and his Verve label.[4][5] Her supple tone, flawless intonation, and virtuosic scat singing made her one of the most celebrated jazz vocalists of the 20th century.[4][5]

Count Basie, meanwhile, led one of the definitive swing orchestras, known for its relaxed but powerful groove, riff‑based arrangements, and economical piano style. Their professional paths crossed frequently on stage, but the partnership became especially significant on record from the late 1950s onward. They first recorded together on the 1957 album “One O’Clock Jump,” and in 1963 Basie and his orchestra joined Fitzgerald for the studio album “Ella and Basie!,” produced by Norman Granz with arrangements by Quincy Jones, a set widely praised for the tight integration of Fitzgerald’s voice with Basie’s swinging band.[1][3] Later Pablo‑label projects such as “A Classy Pair” (1979) and “A Perfect Match” (1980) documented their mature, easy rapport, even as Fitzgerald’s health was declining.[2] Collectively, these albums epitomize the fusion of first‑rank big band swing with virtuosic jazz singing and helped cement both artists’ legacies as central architects of 20th‑century jazz.[1][2][3]

As a combined name on recordings and concert bills, “Ella Fitzgerald and Count Basie” signifies a meeting of complementary aesthetics: Fitzgerald’s agile, harmonically sophisticated, and often playful vocal lines riding over Basie’s disciplined, riff‑driven ensemble and spare piano comping. Critics have noted that Basie’s inherently swinging style was a natural fit for Fitzgerald, who had herself come out of the big band era and adapted seamlessly to more modern idioms like bebop; albums such as “Ella and Basie!”—sometimes reissued as “On the Sunny Side of the Street”—are frequently cited among her best big‑band records because of the polished match between singer, band, and arrangements.[1][2][3] Their work together also illustrated how classic swing vocabulary could remain fresh into the 1960s and beyond, influencing later generations of big band leaders and jazz vocalists who looked to these collaborations as models of balance between ensemble power and vocal nuance.[1][2]

## Fun Facts
- Although Ella Fitzgerald later became world‑famous as a singer with Count Basie and others, as a young performer she originally wanted to be a dancer and only shifted to singing after winning an amateur contest at the Apollo Theatre.[5]
- Fitzgerald’s breakout hit “A-Tisket, A-Tasket,” recorded with Chick Webb’s band in 1938, was based on a children’s nursery rhyme; its huge success on radio and records helped set the stage for later high‑profile pairings like her albums with Count Basie.[5]
- Ella and Basie’s first major studio album together, “Ella and Basie!,” was arranged by a young Quincy Jones, who tailored his charts to highlight both Fitzgerald’s vocal agility and the Basie band’s trademark swing.[1][3]
- Even late in her career, when her health was in decline, Fitzgerald continued to record with Basie for Pablo Records on albums such as “A Classy Pair” and “A Perfect Match,” underscoring the durability of their musical partnership.[2]

### Mentors/Influences
- [[chick_webb|Chick Webb]] - Webb was Ella Fitzgerald’s first major bandleader and effectively her mentor, hiring her for his swing band at the Savoy Ballroom and giving her a platform to develop as a big band singer, which shaped the style she later brought to her collaborations with Count Basie. (Early recordings including “A-Tisket, A-Tasket” (Decca, 1938) with the Chick Webb Orchestra) [Mid‑1930s–1939[4][5]]
- [[dizzy_gillespie|Dizzy Gillespie]] - Touring and performing with Dizzy Gillespie in the 1940s introduced Fitzgerald to bebop and directly inspired her to develop her virtuosic scat‑singing approach, a hallmark of her later big‑band work with Basie’s orchestra. (Bebop‑era performances and Decca recordings such as “Oh, Lady Be Good” that showcased her scat style) [Mid‑1940s[4][5]]
- [[norman_granz|Norman Granz]] - As Ella’s manager and producer, Granz shaped her career direction, signing her to Verve, organizing tours with major big bands including Duke Ellington and Count Basie, and producing albums that paired her with Basie’s orchestra. (World tour with Louis Armstrong and the Duke Ellington and Count Basie big bands; Verve and later Pablo albums including “Ella and Basie!”) [Mid‑1940s onward; Verve era from 1956[4][5][3]]

### Key Collaborators

- [[quincy_jones|Quincy Jones]] - Arranger for the album “Ella and Basie!,” responsible for crafting big band charts that tightly matched Fitzgerald’s vocal phrasing with the Basie orchestra’s swing feel. (“Ella and Basie!” (1963), including arrangements for most of the album’s tracks) [Early 1960s[1][3]]
- [[the_count_basie_orchestra|The Count Basie Orchestra]] - Basie’s big band provided the instrumental foundation for Fitzgerald’s vocals on several joint projects, exemplifying the synthesis of classic swing ensemble writing with modern vocal jazz. (“Ella and Basie!”; “A Classy Pair”; “A Perfect Match” and other concert collaborations) [Late 1950s–1980s[1][2][3]]
- [[louis_armstrong|Louis Armstrong]] - Frequent touring and recording partner with Fitzgerald, including Granz‑organized tours that also featured the Duke Ellington and Count Basie bands; Armstrong’s presence helped situate Fitzgerald within a lineage of classic jazz while she also appeared with Basie.
