## Biography
Spanish Harlem Orchestra (SHO) is a leading New York–based salsa and Latin jazz ensemble founded around 2000 by producer Aaron Levinson and pianist–arranger Oscar Hernández, a Bronx-born musician raised in a large Puerto Rican family whose musical sensibilities were shaped by the nearby Spanish Harlem barrio.[2][5][7] After two decades of session work, arranging, and producing for major Latin acts, Hernández was invited by Levinson to assemble a large Latin dance orchestra dedicated to the classic New York salsa dura sound of the 1960s and 1970s.[1][5][7] The group’s debut album, *Un Gran Día en el Barrio* (2002), revived the vintage, hard-hitting salsa style with new material and immediately drew critical acclaim, earning a Grammy nomination for Best Salsa Album and a Latin Billboard Award for Salsa Album of the Year – Best New Group.[1][3]

Building on this success, SHO released *Across 110th Street* in 2004, titled after Harlem’s southern boundary and featuring guest vocalist Rubén Blades; the album won the 2005 Grammy Award for Best Salsa/Merengue Album and cemented the orchestra’s international reputation.[1][2][3] Subsequent releases such as *United We Swing*, *Viva la Tradición*, *Anniversary*, and *Imágenes Latinas* have showcased the band’s commitment to preserving and modernizing salsa dura with a 13-piece lineup, tight horn arrangements, and strong lead and coro vocals, while touring extensively worldwide.[1][3][4][5][8] With multiple Grammy wins and nominations—including Grammy Awards for Best Tropical Latin Album in 2010 and for Best Tropical Album in 2019 with *Anniversary*—Spanish Harlem Orchestra has become a standard-bearer of contemporary Latin dance music, explicitly dedicated to keeping the legacy of New York salsa, Afro‑Cuban jazz, and the sounds of the barrio alive for new generations.[2][3][4][5]

Stylistically, SHO is known for a raw, organic, “vintage” sound that foregrounds driving rhythm sections, intricate horn lines, and arrangements rooted in classic New York salsa while remaining grounded in Hernández’s four-decade career and influences.[3][4][5][8] The band draws inspiration from earlier New York ensembles such as Conjunto Libre—led by Manny Oquendo and featuring musicians like Andy and Jerry González and Barry Rogers—whose blend of Afro‑Cuban tradition and jazz improvisation helped define the salsa dura idiom that SHO now extends; in fact, SHO’s 2022 album *Imágenes Latinas* is explicitly dedicated to Conjunto Libre and its members.[1][4][5] Through this combination of historical awareness, virtuosic musicianship, and contemporary energy, Spanish Harlem Orchestra is widely regarded as one of the most authentic heirs to the classic New York salsa sound and a central force in the ongoing “salsa reconstruction” movement.[1][3][4]

## Fun Facts
- The group’s name pays homage to Spanish Harlem (El Barrio) in New York City, the neighborhood whose street sound and culture shaped bandleader Oscar Hernández’s musical upbringing in the 1960s.
- Spanish Harlem Orchestra’s very first album, *Un Gran Día en el Barrio*, not only revived classic 1970s New York salsa aesthetics but also scored a Grammy nomination and a Latin Billboard Award, an unusually strong debut for a traditional salsa outfit.
- *Across 110th Street*, the album that earned SHO its first Grammy win, takes its title from the street that marks Harlem’s southern boundary, symbolically situating the band’s sound at the cultural crossroads of uptown Manhattan.
- In 2022, SHO released *Imágenes Latinas*, an album explicitly dedicated to Conjunto Libre and its members—Manny Oquendo, Andy González, Jerry González, and Barry Rogers—underscoring how directly the band sees itself as continuing that earlier New York salsa and Latin jazz legacy.
