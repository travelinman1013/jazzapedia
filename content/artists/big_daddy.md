## Biography
Antonio Hardy, professionally known as Big Daddy Kane, was born on September 10, 1968, in Brooklyn, New York. He began his rap career in 1986 as a member of the Juice Crew, a Queens-based hip-hop collective headed by producer Marley Marl. Kane signed with Cold Chillin' Records in 1987 and debuted with the single "Raw," establishing himself as a virtuosic lyricist with rapid-fire delivery and technical precision. His stage name derived from a combination of Caine, the character from the TV show *Kung Fu*, and Big Daddy, the character played by Vincent Price in the 1963 film *Beach Party*.

Throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s, Kane released a series of critically acclaimed albums that solidified his status as one of hip-hop's greatest MCs. His 1988 debut album *Long Live the Kane* featured the hit "Ain't No Half Steppin'," which Rolling Stone ranked 25th on its list of *The 50 Greatest Hip-Hop Songs of All Time*. His 1989 follow-up, *It's a Big Daddy Thing*, became his biggest commercial success, featuring tracks like "Smooth Operator" and the Teddy Riley-produced "I Get the Job Done." In 1991, Kane won a Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group for his contribution to Quincy Jones's collaborative track "Back on the Block." Beyond music, Kane revolutionized hip-hop performance with theatrical live shows featuring choreography and tailored costumes, and he became the first rapper to hold two sold-out shows exclusively for women at the Apollo Theater.

Kane's influence extended beyond his own recordings through his work as a battle MC and collaborator. AllMusic praised his "near-peerless technique" and "razor-clean dexterity," noting that he "had the sheer verbal facility to ambush any MC and exhilarate anyone who witnessed or heard him perform." Though his commercial output declined after the 1990s, with his final solo album *Veteranz' Day* released in 1998, Kane continued performing and recording sporadically into the 2020s, including the 2020 single "Enough" addressing police brutality. He received a VH1 Hip Hop Honor in 2005, cementing his legacy as a master wordsmith and major influence on generations of MCs.
