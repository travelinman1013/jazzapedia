## Biography
Joe Pass, born Joseph Anthony Jacobi Passalacqua on January 13, 1929, in New Brunswick, New Jersey, to Sicilian immigrant parents, discovered the guitar at age nine after watching Gene Autry in the film Ride, Tenderfoot, Ride. He practiced obsessively, gigging professionally by 14 and earning more than his steelworker father. Influenced by Django Reinhardt, he studied briefly with Harry Volpe in New York before embarking on a turbulent path of travel, gigs in places like New Orleans and Las Vegas, and struggles with heroin addiction, leading to imprisonment in 1954 and rehabilitation at Synanon in 1960, where he recommitted to music.[1][3][4][7]

Pass debuted with the 1962 album Sounds of Synanon on Pacific Jazz, marking his recovery and featuring fellow residents. He became a prolific studio musician in Los Angeles, collaborating with artists like Julie London, Frank Sinatra, George Shearing, Bud Shank, and Gerald Wilson. His style revolutionized solo jazz guitar through advanced harmony, self-accompaniment with chords, counterpoint, and walking bass lines. Signing with Norman Granz's Pablo label in 1973, he released the landmark Virtuoso album—entirely improvised solo standards—that established him as a giant, followed by sequels and Grammy-winning work.[1][2][3][4]

In the 1970s and 1980s, Pass toured globally with Oscar Peterson and Niels-Henning Ørsted Pedersen, appearing on over 70 albums. Despite a liver cancer diagnosis in 1992, he performed until 16 days before his death on May 23, 1994, at age 65, leaving a legacy as the preeminent solo jazz guitarist, often compared to Wes Montgomery.[1][3][6]

## Fun Facts
- Pass recorded the groundbreaking Virtuoso album entirely solo and improvised, with no pre-planned routines; re-recording it the next day would have yielded completely different results.[1]
- At Synanon rehab in 1960, he arrived with 13 cents and no guitar but formed his first working band there and debuted with Sounds of Synanon.[3]
- He gigged for strippers in New Orleans, stayed up for days pawning his guitar repeatedly, and prioritized staying high during his addiction years.[1]
- His final recording was a collection of Hank Williams songs with guitarist Roy Clark, just 16 days before his death.[1]
