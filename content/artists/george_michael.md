## Biography
George Michael, born Georgios Kyriacos Panayiotou on June 25, 1963, in Finchley, London, England, rose to prominence as a member of the pop duo Wham! formed with childhood friend Andrew Ridgeley in 1981.[3][4] As the lead vocalist and primary songwriter, Michael helped establish Wham! as a major force in 1980s pop music, with the band achieving massive commercial success through iconic hits like "Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go" (1984), "Careless Whisper" (1984), and "Last Christmas" (1984).[3][4][7] The duo's debut album *Fantastic* (1983) reached number one in Britain, and they sold over 30 million records worldwide before disbanding in 1986.[1][3]

Following Wham!'s dissolution, Michael launched a transformative solo career that established him as one of the best-selling musicians of all time. His debut solo album *Faith* (1987) marked a dramatic artistic shift, showcasing a more mature and provocative image that earned critical acclaim and won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 1989.[5][6][7] The album spawned multiple hit singles including "I Want Your Sex," "Father Figure," and the title track "Faith," and has sold over 25 million copies worldwide.[5][6] Throughout his career spanning thirty-five years, Michael topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart eight times in the US and achieved seven UK number-one singles as a solo artist, while winning two Grammy Awards, four American Music Awards, twelve Billboard Awards, and six Ivor Novello Awards for songwriting.[1]

Michael's career was marked by both tremendous artistic achievement and personal struggles. In 1990, he engaged in a prolonged legal battle with Sony Records, famously calling his contract "professional slavery" as he sought control of his master recordings and release from his eight-album deal; though he lost the case, Virgin and Dreamworks SKG purchased his contract from Sony in 1995, allowing him to resume his recording career.[2] In 1998, Michael publicly announced his homosexuality following an arrest for lewd conduct, becoming a prominent LGBTQ+ advocate and philanthropist who donated substantial time and wealth to charitable causes.[7] Despite health challenges, including a bout with pneumonia in 2011 that cut short his Symphonica tour and a subsequent drug rehabilitation program in 2015, Michael continued performing until his final concert in October 2012.[4] He died on December 25, 2016, at age 53 from liver and heart disease, leaving behind an enduring legacy as a transformative figure in pop music.[3][4]

## Fun Facts
- At age 21, George Michael became the youngest recipient ever to win the Ivor Novello Award for Songwriter of the Year in 1985 for "Careless Whisper," and remains the only individual songwriter to have ever won the prestigious Songwriter of the Year Award three times.[1]
- George Michael was the first pop artist to perform a concert at the newly built Wembley Stadium as part of his 25 Live stadium tour.[6]
- Michael's legal battle with Sony Records in 1990 was so contentious that he famously described his recording contract as "professional slavery," though he ultimately lost the case and was ordered to pay court costs for both sides.[2]
- Despite his death on December 25, 2016 (Christmas Day), coming as a shock to fans, Michael had continued his philanthropic work and touring well into his final years, with his last completed album *Symphonica* released in 2014.[4]
