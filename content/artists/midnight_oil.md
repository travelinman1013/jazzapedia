## Biography
Midnight Oil, an Australian rock band formed in Sydney in 1972 as Farm by school friends Rob Hirst (drums), Jim Moginie (guitar/keyboard), and Andrew James (bass), evolved from a covers band playing Cream and Led Zeppelin into a progressive rock outfit after recruiting vocalist Peter Garrett in 1973. By 1976, they changed their name to Midnight Oil—drawn from a hat—and added guitarist Martin Rotsey, developing a hard-driving punk-hard rock sound tied to Sydney's surfing community. Managed by Gary Morris, they established their own label Powderworks, releasing their self-titled debut album in 1978, which went gold despite modest chart success, building a reputation through relentless touring and intense live shows.[1][2][3][4]

The band's career breakthrough came with the 1987 album Diesel and Dust, inspired by a transformative 1985 tour of remote Aboriginal communities with the Warumpi Band, producing the global hit 'Beds Are Burning' that highlighted Indigenous rights. Albums like Blue Sky Mining (1990) followed with hits such as 'Blue Sky Mine,' cementing their alternative rock style blending aggressive guitars, political lyrics, and activism on environmental, anti-nuclear, and Indigenous issues. Bassists shifted from James (left 1980 due to health) to Peter Gifford, then Bones Hillman in 1987. They disbanded in 2002 but reunited for benefits and tours, releasing The Makarrata Project (2020) and Show of Hands (2022), the latter featuring Hillman's final recordings before his death in 2020.[1][2]

Midnight Oil's legacy endures as one of Australia's most respected acts, known for furious performances, independence via Powderworks, and activism, including WaveAid (2005) and Sound Relief (2009). Their music shifted from pub rock roots to anthemic calls for social change, influencing global rock while maintaining a formidable presence in Australia.[1][2]
