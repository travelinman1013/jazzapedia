## Fun Facts
- Edna Winston's recordings appear on the Document DOCD-5523 compilation, preserving her rare 1926-1927 Victor sides.
- Her November 1926 session featured Eugene ‘Bud’ Aiken on trombone, a highly skilled but obscure player who died young in August 1927, preventing greater fame.
- Personnel listings for her sessions vary across discographies like BGR and Rust, with debates over clarinetist identity (Happy Caldwell vs. Bob Fuller) and banjoist presence.
- One take of 'Ever After On' (37788-2) was issued on Retrieval RTR 79078, showing subtle musical differences from the primary Victor release.
