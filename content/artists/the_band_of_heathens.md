## Biography
The Band of Heathens is an Austin-based roots-rock and Americana band that formed organically in 2005 when three singer-songwriters—Colin Brooks, Ed Jurdi, and Gordy Quist—began collaborating during weekly residencies at Momo's, a local Austin music venue.[2] What started as a spontaneous side project called the "Good Time Supper Club," featuring three singer-songwriters in the round backed by bassist Seth Whitney and drummer John Chipman, quickly evolved into a full-fledged rock and roll band.[3] A local newspaper misprint that billed them as "The Heathens" inadvertently gave the group its permanent name.[2] The band's early success came through live performances, with their first two albums being live recordings—*Live from Momo's* (2006) and *Live at Antone's* (2007)—before their self-titled 2008 studio debut, produced by Ray Wylie Hubbard, topped the Americana charts and earned a Top-10 year-end spot.[2][3]

Throughout their career, the Band of Heathens has maintained artistic independence while building a sustainable business model for their music. After significant personnel changes in 2011-2012, with Colin Brooks departing and the rhythm section transitioning, co-leaders Ed Jurdi and Gordy Quist redefined the group's sound on 2013's *Sunday Morning Record*, adding keyboardist Trevor Nealon, drummer Richard Millsap, and later bassist Jesse Wilson in 2017.[1][3] The band has released ten albums total, including *One Foot in the Ether* (2009), *Duende* (2017), *Stranger* (2020), and the critically acclaimed *Simple Things* (2023), which blends rock, blues, soul, and folk with heartfelt songwriting.[2][3] Known for their energetic live performances and dual-lead vocals, the Band of Heathens has performed over twelve hundred shows across thirteen countries while remaining proudly independent, establishing themselves as a model for sustainable independent musicianship in Austin's competitive music scene.[1]

The band's approach to business and sustainability has become notable within the Austin music community. Co-founder Gordy Quist, who holds a degree from Dartmouth and has business experience, helped establish a disciplined financial model where the band committed to saving half of all gig money for recording and touring.[4] Notably, they pioneered an early form of crowdfunding for their debut album, offering fans the opportunity to pre-fund the project with a promise of 80 percent of album sales going toward repayment plus 20 percent profit—a commitment they fulfilled in just two-and-a-half years.[4] All current band members earn their living from the band and side gigs, with no traditional nine-to-five employment, making them a working middle-class band that has successfully navigated the challenges of the modern music industry.[4]

## Fun Facts
- The band's name originated from a newspaper misprint that billed their Good Time Supper Club residency at Momo's as 'The Heathens,' and the accidental name stuck permanently.[2][6]
- Gordy Quist arrived in Austin in 2004 with only the goal of making enough money to eat and continue playing music, eventually co-founding one of Austin's most successful independent bands.[4]
- The Band of Heathens pioneered an early form of crowdfunding before Kickstarter became popular, offering fans the opportunity to pre-fund their 2008 debut album with a promise of 80 percent of sales going toward repayment plus 20 percent profit, which they fulfilled in just two-and-a-half years.[4]
- The band has performed over twelve hundred shows across thirteen countries while maintaining complete artistic independence and never borrowing money after their initial crowdfunded debut, establishing a sustainable business model that has become a model for other Austin musicians.[1][4]
