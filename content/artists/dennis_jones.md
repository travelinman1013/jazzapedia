## Biography
Dennis Jones is an American blues rock singer, guitarist, and songwriter born in 1958 in Monkton, Maryland.[1][3] Inspired by his parents' record collection featuring B.B. King and Bobby Bland, Jones received a guitar at age 13 and began playing in local bands while still in his teenage years.[3] After high school, he joined the military and was stationed in Germany, where he developed his musical style playing with various blues and R&B bands.[2][4] He later relocated to Los Angeles, where he balanced a day job as an elevator technician with weekend performances, eventually forming the band Blackhead before transitioning to lead his own blues rock ensemble.[3][7]

Jones' professional recording career began in 2003 with his debut solo album *Falling Up*, released on his own label, Blue Rock Records.[1][3] A significant milestone came in 2004 when he won first place at the 20th International Blues Challenge as guitarist with Zac Harmon & the Mid-South Revue.[1][3] Throughout his career, Jones has released eight albums, with notable releases including *Passion For The Blues* (2006), *Pleasure & Pain* (2009), *Soft Hard and Loud* (2020), and *About Time* (2024).[1][3] His track "Deep Blues" from his debut album was featured in the 2006 film *Sea of Fear*.[1][3]

Jones has established himself as a respected figure in contemporary blues music, opening for legendary artists including Johnny Winter, Buddy Guy, and Dick Dale.[3] In 2023, he received the Bobby Rush Entertainer Award for Outstanding Musicianship Performing Traditional Blues at the Jus' Blues Music Awards in Tunica, Mississippi.[2][3] His eighth album *About Time* earned a 2025 Blues Music Award nomination for Best Blues Rock Album.[2] Jones' musical approach seamlessly blends vintage blues-rock elements with contemporary songwriting, addressing modern social issues while maintaining deep roots in traditional blues traditions.[6]
