## Biography
John Scofield (born December 26, 1951) is an American guitarist and composer whose music blends jazz, jazz fusion, funk, blues, soul and rock. He first came to mainstream attention as a 3.5-year member of Miles Davis's band, establishing himself as a masterful jazz improviser whose work generally falls between post-bop, funk-edged jazz, and R&B. Throughout his career, Scofield has maintained an open musical mind, punctuating traditional jazz offerings with funk-oriented electric music and exploring influences beyond the jazz tradition, including rock, folk, and country. He has been nominated for nine Grammy Awards and won three, while also receiving the French Ordre des Arts et des Lettres.

As a prolific bandleader, Scofield has recorded over 40 albums as a leader, collaborating with major players including Pat Metheny, Charlie Haden, Jack DeJohnette, Joe Lovano, and Brad Mehldau. His recent work includes the autobiographical solo album *John Scofield* (2021), which reflected on formative influences including Buddy Holly and Hank Williams, and the double album *Uncle John's Band* (recorded 2022), which incorporated compositions from Miles Davis, Leonard Bernstein, Bob Dylan, Neil Young, and the Grateful Dead. Beyond his recording career, Scofield tours internationally approximately 200 days per year and serves as an Adjunct Professor of Music at New York University.

In 2025, Scofield released *Memories of Home*, his first duo album with legendary bassist Dave Holland on ECM Records. This collaboration represents a significant milestone in Scofield's discography, as his duo recordings have been far less documented than his celebrated trio work. The album showcases Scofield's Ibanez AS200 electric guitar paired with Holland's double bass in an intimate, effects-free setting, featuring compositions that revisit pieces from both artists' earlier ECM recordings alongside new material that demonstrates their continued creative vitality and deep musical understanding.
