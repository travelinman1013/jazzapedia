## Biography
Kirk Knuffke is a prolific cornetist-composer born in 1980 and raised in Colorado who has become one of modern jazz's most distinctive voices. Self-taught initially on trumpet and cornet, Knuffke benefited from private tutelage by influential figures including Ornette Coleman, Art Lande, and Ron Miles before relocating to New York City in 2005. Since his arrival in NYC, he has quickly established himself as a force on the jazz scene, working with leading musicians across multiple stylistic approaches and releasing approximately 20 albums as a leader or co-leader over two decades.

Knuffke's artistic approach is characterized by his ability to navigate fluidly between free improvisation and structured forms, earning recognition from major publications and institutions. His 2017 album Cherryco received NPR's Jazz Album of the Year, while his 2022 release Gravity Without Airs featuring pianist Matthew Shipp and bassist Michael Bisio earned a 4½-star review from DownBeat magazine and a critic's playlist pick in The New York Times. He was named a "Rising Star" in the DownBeat Critics Poll in 2015 and placed second in Europe's El Intruso Critics Poll for trumpet in 2016.

Beyond his work as a bandleader, Knuffke maintains an active presence as an in-demand sideman, recording and touring with vocalists like Cécile McLorin Salvant, guitarists Mary Halvorson and Charlie Hunter, and saxophonist James Brandon Lewis. He is also deeply committed to music education, teaching at international jazz camps, university masterclasses, and privately via in-person and Zoom lessons. His comprehensive understanding of jazz history combined with his boundless creative virtuosity has enabled him to work on equal footing with both elder statesmen and contemporary innovators.
