## Biography
Teyana Me Shay Jacqueline Taylor was born on December 10, 1990, and emerged as a multifaceted entertainer in the music industry at an exceptionally young age.[1] At just 15 years old, she gained recognition as the choreographer for Beyoncé's 2006 hit single "Ring the Alarm," which led to a recording contract with Pharrell Williams' Star Trak Entertainment in 2007.[1][2] After parting ways with Star Trak in 2012, Taylor signed with Kanye West's GOOD Music label under Def Jam Recordings, appearing on the compilation album Cruel Summer, which peaked at number two on the Billboard 200.[1]

Taylor's solo career took flight with her debut studio album VII in 2014, followed by K.T.S.E. in 2018.[1] Her third album, The Album (2020), marked a significant milestone by entering the top ten on the Billboard 200 and featured collaborations with Missy Elliott and Lauryn Hill.[1] Beyond music, Taylor became known for her work as a choreographer and music video director, earning an MTV Video Music Award for Best Choreography for her work on Kanye West's "Fade" music video.[1] Her fourth studio album, Escape Room, released in August 2025, received a Grammy Award nomination for Best R&B Album.[1] Under the directing pseudonym "Spike Tee," she has directed numerous music videos and won the BET Award for Video Director of the Year in 2020 and 2023.[1]

Taylor has successfully expanded her career into acting and film, earning critical acclaim for her roles in various projects. Her portrayal of Inez in the 2023 film A Thousand and One earned her the National Board of Review Award for Breakthrough Performance.[1] In 2025, she starred in Paul Thomas Anderson's action film One Battle After Another, for which she received the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress, along with awards from the Los Angeles Film Critics Association and the National Society of Film Critics.[1] She has also appeared in television projects including the Fox music drama series Star (2017–18) and the Ryan Murphy legal drama All's Fair (2025).[1]
