## Biography
Theodore Emile 'Bo' Dollis, born in the Uptown New Orleans neighborhood near the Magnolia Housing Projects, was drawn to the Mardi Gras Indian tradition as a young boy. Despite his parents' concerns over potential violence between rival tribes, he secretly sewed his first suit at age 13 and masked with the Golden Arrows in 1957, later joining the White Eagles and the Wild Magnolias. By 1964, Dollis had risen to Big Chief of the Wild Magnolias, a tribe named after Magnolia Street, leading them for over five decades and transforming their call-and-response chants into a global phenomenon by fusing them with New Orleans funk, R&B, and soul grooves.[1][2][3][4]

Without formal musical training, Dollis's powerful voice and leadership propelled the Wild Magnolias to record seminal albums like *They Call Us Wild* (1970) and *The Wild Magnolias* (1974), produced with all-star backing from artists such as Willie Tee and the Gaturs. Key milestones included their debut at the first New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival in 1970, international tours to Carnegie Hall and the Smithsonian Folklife Festival, and hits like 'Handa Wanda' and 'Smoke My Peace Pipe,' which reached #74 on the Billboard R&B chart. Dollis helped shift the Indian tradition from street violence to artistic beauty, influenced by figures like Tootie Montana.[3][4][5]

Dollis received the National Endowment for the Arts National Heritage Fellowship in 2011, the highest U.S. honor in folk arts. He passed away on January 20, 2015, at age 71, passing the torch to his son, Gerard 'Bo Jr.' Dollis, who became Big Chief and fronted the 2013 album *New Kind of Funk*. The Wild Magnolias continue, preserving and evolving the tradition through family members like Big Queen Laurita Dollis.[1][2][3]
