## Biography
Fat Larry’s Band was an American R&B, funk and post‑disco group from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, formed and led by drummer, vocalist and songwriter “Fat” Larry James (born August 2, 1949). The band grew out of the fertile Philadelphia soul scene of the mid‑1970s, with James initially working as a drummer (including with acts like the Delfonics) before assembling his own ensemble of seasoned local players.[1][2][3][6] Often cited as forming in 1976, the group’s early line‑up featured James on drums and vocals, bassist Larry La Bes, keyboardist Erskine Williams, guitarists Ted Cohen and Tony Middleton, trumpeter/flautist Art Capehart, saxophonist Doug (Khalif) Jones, trombonist/alto saxophonist Jimmy Lee, and vocalists Freddie Campbell and Darryl Grant, most of whom also contributed vocals, giving the band their rich, layered harmonies.[2][3] They signed with WMOT Records and released their debut album *Feel It* in 1976, recorded at Philadelphia’s famed Sigma Sound Studios and produced/arranged by MFSB vibraphonist Vincent Montana Jr., firmly rooting their sound in the lush yet groove‑driven Philadelphia soul tradition.[1][3]

Across nine albums between the mid‑1970s and mid‑1980s, Fat Larry’s Band evolved from straight‑ahead disco and funk into a sleek, radio‑friendly post‑disco and boogie style that still showcased tight ensemble playing, prominent horn arrangements, and James’s sense of groove.[1][3][7] Early work like *Feel It* emphasized up‑tempo disco‑funk, while later releases, especially *Lookin’ for Love* (1979) and *Breakin’ Out* (1982), blended melodic soul balladry with polished funk‑boogie rhythms.[1][3][7] James co‑wrote much of the material—often with bandmates and his wife Doris—and also produced, making him the central creative force.[1][3] The group found their greatest commercial success in the early 1980s: the infectious boogie track “Act Like You Know” became a cult favorite and later a sampling staple, and the smooth ballad “Zoom” reached No. 2 on the UK Singles Chart in October 1982, giving the band a substantial following in Britain and Europe.[2][3][6]

Though they never became superstars in the U.S. charts, Fat Larry’s Band left a lasting legacy through their contributions to the Philadelphia funk sound and their deep footprint in later hip‑hop and dance music. The drum break from “Down on the Avenue” (from *Feel It*) has been heavily sampled by hip‑hop artists including N.W.A, Ice‑T, Jungle Brothers and Run‑D.M.C., effectively turning James’s drumming into a foundational breakbeat for a new generation.[2] Tracks like “Act Like You Know” were revived for younger audiences via placements such as the *Grand Theft Auto: Vice City* soundtrack, cementing the band’s status as a cult favorite among funk, boogie and crate‑digging communities decades after their original run.[2][3] The group came to an end after Larry James died of a heart attack on December 5, 1987, at just 38 years old, but their recordings continue to circulate widely among soul and funk aficionados, DJs and sample‑based producers.[2][3][6]

## Fun Facts
- The drum break from “Down on the Avenue,” the opening track of their debut album *Feel It* (1976), has been sampled by major hip‑hop artists including N.W.A, Ice‑T, Jungle Brothers and Run‑D.M.C., making Fat Larry’s Band an uncredited backbone of classic rap production.[2]
- Their smooth ballad “Zoom” was a much bigger hit in the UK than in the United States, reaching No. 2 on the UK Singles Chart in October 1982 and becoming one of the era’s signature slow jams for British soul fans.[2][6]
- “Act Like You Know,” originally a modest U.S. chart entry in 1982, found a second life decades later after being included on the *Grand Theft Auto: Vice City* soundtrack, introducing Fat Larry’s Band to a new generation of listeners and club DJs.[2][3]
- Larry James’s wife, Doris, was deeply involved behind the scenes: she arranged backing vocals for the band from its inception and co‑wrote songs such as the single “Be My Lady,” highlighting the family nature of the project.[1][3]
