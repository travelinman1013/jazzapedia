## Biography
Hadley J. Castille (March 3, 1933 – October 25, 2012) was a prominent Cajun fiddler, songwriter, vocalist, and cultural ambassador born and raised in St. Landry Parish, Louisiana. He learned to play the fiddle as a young teenager from his uncle Cyprien Castille, who instilled in him a deep appreciation for the Cajun method of making the fiddle sing. Under the influence of Harry Choates' 1946 recording of "Jolie Blonde," Castille developed his own approach to Cajun Swing-style music, blending traditional Cajun elements with contemporary influences. Throughout his career, he became one of the most respected exponents of southern Louisiana's musical tradition, performing at prestigious venues including the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival and the Kaustinen Folk Music Festival in Finland.

Castille's musical output was deeply autobiographical, with many of his compositions reflecting his personal experiences and Cajun heritage. His most celebrated song, "200 Lines: I Must Not Speak French," won the Cajun French Music Association's "Le Cajun" award in 1992 and recounted his childhood punishment for speaking French in school—a powerful statement about cultural preservation. He collaborated extensively with his son Blake Castille, a guitarist and songwriter who contributed original compositions to his albums. Castille's commitment to keeping Cajun music alive for younger generations was evident in his energetic live performances, where he interspersed lively anecdotes and stories about Cajun people and culture between songs. His band was the first Cajun ensemble known to perform with a full symphony orchestra, premiering "A Cajun Concerto" with the Acadian Symphony Orchestra to a standing-room-only crowd.

Castille's legacy encompasses numerous recordings, television appearances on programs like ABC's "Good Morning America" and NBC's "Today Show," and contributions to film soundtracks. He was inducted into the Louisiana Hall of Fame and received multiple awards throughout his career. His influence extended to the next generation, including his fiddler granddaughter Sarah Jayde Williams, who performed in his Sharecroppers Band. Castille passed away on October 25, 2012, at age 79, following a battle with cancer, leaving behind a rich musical legacy that continues to inspire Cajun musicians and preserve Louisiana's cultural heritage.

## Fun Facts
- Castille's song 'The Old Battery Radio' was inspired by a specific evening in 1945 when his father brought home the family's first battery radio to their cabin, which had no electricity. That night, they listened to stations from across the country, especially Texas stations playing Bob Wills' western swing, which profoundly influenced Hadley's musical development.
- His band was the first Cajun ensemble known to perform with a full symphony orchestra, premiering 'A Cajun Concerto' with the Acadian Symphony Orchestra to a standing-room-only crowd—a groundbreaking achievement in Cajun music history.
- Castille recorded the theme song for a Clint Eastwood film, demonstrating his reach beyond traditional Cajun music circles into Hollywood productions.
- His song 'Helaire Carrier' tells the true story of an outlaw in St. Landry Parish who attempted to cheat the executioner by slitting his own throat the night before his scheduled hanging, only to have authorities proceed with the execution anyway—a dark piece of local folklore that Castille immortalized in song.
