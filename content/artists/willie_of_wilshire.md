# Willie of Wilshire

## Biography
Willie of Wilshire, born Willie Arevalo, is a first-generation American rapper from Downtown Los Angeles, California, with parents who immigrated from Guatemala (Mayan heritage) and El Salvador. Raised in a rough neighborhood marked by gangs, drugs, police brutality, and poverty, he discovered hip hop as a child despite his mother's warnings against it, associating the genre with gangsters from his 18th Street Gang-affiliated neighbors. This early exposure fueled his passion; he began writing poetry to vent frustrations from growing up poor, evolving it into rhymes scribbled in notebooks and a personal rhyming dictionary. By middle school, he performed raps on the school bus, and in high school, he founded a DJ Hip Hop Club, hosted freestyle battles, DJed basketball games and flyer parties with his crew Turntable Mechanics.[1][2]

Transitioning to college, Arevalo used grant money to buy production equipment like a laptop, mic, and MPC, self-recording beats and tracks. He hustled independently by printing and selling CDs on the streets, securing consignment at Amoeba Music, and performing shows across California while shooting music videos. A pivotal moment came when he met producer Eddie Ruxspin, who mentored him in song structure (16 bars and hooks), propelling his growth. His music draws from personal experiences including love, breakups, financial struggles, dreams, politics, spirituality, and travel, manifesting raw, introspective hip hop. He launched his clothing brand I Awoke and released his debut mixtape Practice, embodying resilience amid constant financial hurdles and self-doubt as an independent artist.[1][2]

Willie of Wilshire, aka WOW, continues as a songwriter, performer, and world traveler, prioritizing evolution in his craft. His style sets him apart through authentic storytelling from a unique viewpoint, pulling inspiration 'from the ether' into reality. Despite ups and downs, he persists, believing in divine guidance toward opportunities, with a presence on platforms like Spotify (12,567 monthly listeners as of recent data) and a low-key popularity reflecting grassroots hustle.[1][2][7]
