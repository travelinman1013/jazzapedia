## Biography
Aswad, meaning 'black' in Arabic, formed in 1974-1975 in the Ladbroke Grove area of West London by musicians of Caribbean descent, inspired by Bob Marley and roots reggae. The original quintet included Brinsley 'Chaka B' or 'Dan' Forde (vocals, rhythm guitar), Angus 'Drummie Zeb' Gaye (vocals, drums), Donald 'Dee' Griffiths (lead guitar), George 'Ras' Oban (bass), and Courtney 'Khaki' Hemmings (keyboards). They developed a distinctive British reggae sound blending roots reggae with R&B, soul, soca, funk, dub, and later dancehall and hip-hop influences, addressing themes of Black pride, oppression, and spirituality over heavy bass grooves.[1][2][3][4][5]

In 1976, Aswad became the first British reggae band signed to a major label, Island Records, after boldly demoing at their office for Chris Blackwell. Their debut single 'Back to Africa' topped UK reggae charts, followed by the self-titled album. Early albums like New Chapter (1981) gained traction with tracks like 'Fire,' while they backed Burning Spear on tour. Lineup changes occurred, with Oban leaving post-Jamaica trip in 1977; by the 1980s, they slimmed to a core trio of Forde, Drummie Zeb, and Tony Gad Robinson (bass). Breakthrough commercial success came in 1988 with their #1 UK cover of 'Don't Turn Around,' and 1994's Rise & Shine earned a Grammy nomination, featuring the hit 'Shine,' topping charts in UK and Japan.[1][2][3][4][5]

Aswad's legacy endures as pioneers of British reggae, releasing over 20 albums, earning MOBO's Outstanding Contribution to Black Music in 2000, and influencing UK acts like Steel Pulse. Known for live prowess (e.g., 1983's Live and Direct), they fused genres adventurously, remaining beloved after decades.[1][2][3][4][5]

## Fun Facts
- Aswad boldly crashed Island Records' reception without an appointment, demoing on the spot to win over Chris Blackwell and secure their historic major label deal.
- 'Love Fire' (1981) entered the Jamaican reggae canon, uniquely covered by Jamaican producers—a rare honor for a British band.
- They traveled to Jamaica in 1977 to record but faced financial woes, prompting George Oban to briefly quit for a day job.
- Drummie Zeb was just 16 when joining as the 'incredible' drummer-singer in the initial lineup.
