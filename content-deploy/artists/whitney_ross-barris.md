# Whitney Ross-Barris

## Biography
Whitney Ross-Barris is a prairie-born, Toronto-based jazz singer, songwriter and actor who has built a respected profile on the Canadian jazz scene since the late 2000s.[2][5] Performing regularly around Ontario and across South Western Ontario’s clubs, restaurants and concert halls, she has appeared at major events including the TD Toronto Jazz Festival, Kensington Market Jazz Festival, Springtide Music Festival, Port Hope Jazz Festival and Markham Jazz Festival, and her recordings have been featured on JAZZ.FM91 and CBC Radio.[2][6][1] In addition to her musical career, she has worked as a professional theatre actor for more than 25 years across Canada, the United States and Europe, a background that shapes her engaging, often humorous and emotionally direct stage presence.[2][1][7][8]

Ross-Barris released a self-produced debut EP in 2009, followed by her full-length jazz album "Everybody’s Here," which mixed standards, originals and long-lost compositions by her late grandfather, writer‑broadcaster Alex Barris.[2] In 2017 she issued "The Bright Lunch Trio," a trio record of entirely original jazz-based songs co-written with guitarist Nathan Hiltz, and later released "Curtains of Light," an album of original material that moves fluidly between jazz, soul, pop and related styles, featuring cinematic arrangements by Michael Shand and Drew Jurecka.[2][7][4] During the COVID-19 pandemic, while isolating at home in rural Ontario with her three children and an obstinate cat, she wrote extensively at her 117‑year‑old piano; with support from the Ontario Arts Council and her fan community, those songs became the basis for a new album of entirely original compositions.[2][7] Known for what JazzFM’s John Devenish describes as a deep respect for the roots of jazz and a influences list ranging from Chet Baker and Louis Armstrong to Tom Waits and Marvin Gaye, Ross-Barris blends classic vocal-jazz phrasing with theatrical storytelling and contemporary songwriter sensibilities, often leading audiences from laughter to tears in a single set.[2][7]

Alongside her recordings and festival appearances, Ross-Barris has been a recurring featured vocalist in JAZZ.FM91’s One Stop Vocal Jazz Safari and has contributed lyrics and vocals to other projects, including John MacMurchy’s "The Art of Breath, Volume One" and "Christmas on Seaton Street" on Number 9 Audio.[2][3] Her theatre credits include notable productions such as "Assassins" (Manitoba Theatre Centre), "Gorey Story" (The Thistle Project) and "Stormen" in Norway, and she has performed in unconventional venues ranging from a Polish salt mine to a farmyard in Millbrook as well as stages across Canada, the U.S. and Europe.[2][8] Now based in Uxbridge, Ontario after years of “life in the big city,” she balances family life with an active performing and songwriting schedule, and is recognized within the Canadian jazz community for her swinging feel, narrative lyrics and a performance style that is at once theatrical, candid and deeply rooted in jazz tradition.[2][1][8]


## Fun Facts
- Ross-Barris discovered songwriting somewhat unconventionally, joking in her bio that she “self‑admittedly bluffed” her way into it before going on to place songs on stage, film and collaborative recordings.[2]
- She has performed in unusually diverse venues, including a salt mine in Poland and a farmyard in Millbrook, as well as more traditional stages across Canada, the United States and Europe.[8]
- Her album "Everybody’s Here" includes several long‑lost compositions by her late grandfather, the well‑known writer and broadcaster Alex Barris, effectively reviving family material for a new jazz context.[2]
- During the pandemic she wrote much of her later original material at a 117‑year‑old piano in her rural Ontario home, while at the same time juggling isolation with three young children and what she describes as an obstinate cat.[2][7]
