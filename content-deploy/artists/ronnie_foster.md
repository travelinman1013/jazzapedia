# Ronnie Foster

## Biography
Ronnie Foster, a native of Buffalo, New York, began playing piano at age 4 in a classical style but switched to Hammond organ by age 12, studying under jazz organ legend Jimmy Smith and drawing inspiration from players like Larry Young. As a teenager, he practiced diligently, renting studio time for 60 cents an hour, and started gigging locally at 14 before playing weekends with George Benson at 15 and joining the Billy Wooten Trio after high school. His big break came at 20 when he recorded with Grant Green on the 1970 Blue Note album *Alive!*, impressing label executive Dr. George Butler and securing his own contract.[1][2][3]

Foster's solo career peaked in the 1970s with six Blue Note albums including *The Two-Headed Freap* (1972), *Sweet Revival* (1972), *Live at Montreux* (1973), *On the Avenue* (1974), and *Cheshire Cat* (1975), followed by *Love Satellite* (1978) and *Delight* (1979) on Columbia, and *The Racer* on Pro Jazz. His funky soul-jazz style, favoring vamps over improvisation, drew criticism from purists but found cult success later through sampling in acid jazz and hip-hop. From the late 1970s, he focused on session work and production, contributing to classics by George Benson, Stevie Wonder, and Roberta Flack.[1][2][5]

Foster's legacy endures as a Hammond B3 master in jazz funk and soul jazz, with renewed Blue Note re-signing highlighting his place alongside Jimmy Smith and Larry Young. His sideman and production roles with artists like Stanley Turrentine, Stanley Clarke, and Brazilian acts, plus productions like Roger Smith's *Both Sides* (1998/9), underscore his versatility and influence across decades.[2][3][4]

## Fun Facts
- Practiced organ in a Buffalo studio for 60 cents an hour as a teen, building skills before New York gigs.[1]
- His first professional gig was at age 14 in a supper club, marking an early start in tough local scenes.[5]
- Blue Note co-founder Francis Wolff heard him first on Grant Green's *Alive!* (1970), leading to his signing after Wolff's death.[3]
- Produced Brazilian artists for five years and had Stevie Wonder play harmonica on one of his early productions.[4]
