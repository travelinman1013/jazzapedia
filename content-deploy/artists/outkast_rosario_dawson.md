# Outkast, Rosario Dawson

## Biography
Rosario Dawson was born on May 9, 1979, in New York City to Isabel Celeste, a singer of Puerto Rican and Afro-Cuban descent, and grew up in challenging circumstances, including periods of homelessness and living in poverty-stricken conditions with family members, some of whom were HIV-positive. Her mother was a teenager when she had Rosario, and her stepfather worked in construction; the family faced significant hardships in New York. As a child, she appeared briefly on Sesame Street, marking her early entry into performance, and attended the Lee Strasberg Institute for acting training alongside notable alumni like Scarlett Johansson and Mickey Rourke.[1][3][4]

Discovered at age 15 or 16 on her front porch by photographers Larry Clark and aspiring screenwriter Harmony Korine, Dawson landed her breakout role in the controversial 1995 independent film Kids, portraying a sexually active adolescent and launching her career in edgy urban dramas. She transitioned to mainstream films like He Got Game (1998), Men in Black II (2002), Rent (2005)—where she replaced a pregnant Daphne Rubin-Vega as Mimi Marquez and won a Satellite Award—and Sin City (2005), often playing gritty, marginalized characters with depth. While primarily an actress, Dawson ventured into music with a voice-over for Prince's remixed '1999' (1998), an appearance in The Chemical Brothers' 'Out of Control' video (1999), vocals on Kasabian's 'West Ryder Silver Bullet' (2009), and a featured speaking role on OutKast's 'She Lives in My Lap' from the 2003 double album Speakerboxxx/The Love Below, blending her interests in acting and singing.[1][2][3]

Dawson's versatile career spans blockbusters, independents, TV (Daredevil, Jane the Virgin), voice work, and stage productions like Shakespeare in the Park and The Vagina Monologues, while her musical contributions highlight a multi-talented profile tied to genres like musicals. Her legacy includes advocacy work and a rags-to-riches narrative, evolving from street-discovered talent to Hollywood staple known for provocative, authentic roles.[1][3]
