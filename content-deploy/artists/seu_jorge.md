## Biography
Jorge Mário da Silva, known professionally as **Seu Jorge** ("Seu" meaning "Mister" or "Sir" in Brazilian Portuguese), was born on June 8, 1970, in Belford Roxo, in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.[2] Growing up as the eldest of four children in a favela, he began working at the age of ten in a tire shop and later took on various jobs such as courier, joiner, and bar kitchen worker to help support his family.[2] Music, however, was always central in his life: he frequented samba circles and funk parties with his father and brothers, and began singing informally at community events.[2][1] His youth was marked by hardship, including a brief, ill‑fitting stint in the Brazilian Army and the traumatic murder of his younger brother Vitório around 1990, which led to a family breakdown and left him homeless for about three years, often sleeping on the streets of Rio.[2][1] 

Seu Jorge’s fortunes changed when he was invited into the world of theater and professional music. Clarinetist Paulo Moura’s family—specifically Gabriel Moura—invited him to audition for the stage production *A saga da farinha* (The Flour Saga), after which he joined the Companhia de Teatro TUERJ, performing in more than 20 shows as both singer and actor between 1993 and 1997.[2][1][4] During this time he often slept in the theater itself, honing his craft and developing a laid‑back yet rhythmically rich vocal style. In 1997 he became a founding member of the band **Farofa Carioca**, whose 1998 debut album mixed samba, reggae, jongo, funk, and rap, signaling a modern, urban approach to Black Brazilian rhythms.[1][2] His solo debut *Samba Esporte Fino* (also known internationally as *Carolina*) was released in 2001 and later celebrated as one of Brazil’s standout albums of the period, helping establish him as a leading figure in contemporary samba and MPB (Música Popular Brasileira).[3] 

Internationally, Seu Jorge is widely recognized for bridging Brazilian music and global pop culture. He gained worldwide attention as an actor in *City of God* (2002), playing Mané Galinha, and in Wes Anderson’s *The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou* (2004), where he portrayed Pelé dos Santos and performed Portuguese‑language acoustic covers of David Bowie songs on the soundtrack.[2][3][5] These interpretations earned direct praise from Bowie himself and introduced Jorge’s intimate, samba‑inflected style to new audiences.[5] Over the years he has released numerous solo albums, collaborated with Brazilian and international artists, and is frequently described as a **renewer of Brazilian pop samba**, blending traditional samba, soul, funk, and MPB while remaining rooted in the sounds of Rio’s suburbs and samba schools.[2][5] His work has influenced perceptions of 21st‑century Brazilian music abroad and solidified his legacy as both a cultural ambassador and a multifaceted artist—singer, songwriter, instrumentalist, producer, and acclaimed actor.[1][2][5]
