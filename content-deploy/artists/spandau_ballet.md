# Spandau Ballet

## Biography
Spandau Ballet formed in Islington, North London, in 1979, emerging from the post-punk underground dance scene and becoming the house band for the Blitz Kids New Romantics at London's Blitz club. The classic lineup consisted of brothers Gary Kemp (guitar, synthesizer, backing vocals, primary songwriter), Martin Kemp (bass), Tony Hadley (vocals), Steve Norman (saxophone, percussion), and John Keeble (drums). Inspired by the likes of David Bowie, Kraftwerk, Chic, and the electronic music introduced by DJ Rusty Egan, the band evolved from punk roots to 'European Dance Music' with synthpop and new wave styles, releasing their debut single 'To Cut a Long Story Short' in 1980, which reached No. 5 in the UK, followed by their first album Journeys to Glory in 1981.[1][2][4]

The band achieved massive success in the 1980s with hits like 'True' and 'Gold' from their 1983 album True and 1984's Parade, blending synth-driven melodies, danceable rhythms, and artful aesthetics as pioneers of the New Romantic sound. They split in 1990 amid disputes over songwriting royalties, leading to a lawsuit by Hadley, Norman, and Keeble against Gary Kemp. The group reunited in 2009 for a world tour, but Hadley departed in 2017, replaced briefly by Ross William Wild before the band became inactive in 2019.[1][2][5]

Spandau Ballet's legacy endures as key figures in the 1980s new wave and synthpop scenes, with ten UK top-10 singles and a resurgence via reunions, influencing club culture and leaving an indelible mark through their polished pop anthems and dramatic style.[2][3]

## Fun Facts
- The band's name 'Spandau Ballet' originated from graffiti spotted by Robert Elms in Berlin reading 'Rudolf Hess, all alone, dancing the Spandau Ballet,' possibly referencing a WWII phrase for executions by Spandau prison machine guns.[1][2]
- They rehearsed at school lunchtimes playing sped-up covers of Rolling Stones, Beatles, and Animals songs before their first gig at a school Christmas party in 1976.[2]
- Spandau Ballet's first performance as the named band was an invitation-only audition at a rehearsal studio to test reactions from New Romantic influencers.[2]
- Ross William Wild, their 2018 singer, had previously performed with Martin Kemp in the West End musical Million Dollar Quartet.[2]
