# Bryan Sutton & Billy Strings

## Biography
Bryan Sutton & Billy Strings is not a permanent band but rather a high‑profile collaborative pairing of two generations of bluegrass flatpicking guitar virtuosos, North Carolina–born Bryan Sutton (b. 1973) and Michigan‑raised William Apostol, known professionally as Billy Strings.[1][4][6][7] Sutton emerged in the mid‑1990s as a first‑call Nashville session musician and a breakout lead guitarist with Ricky Skaggs’ Kentucky Thunder, helping define the modern, high‑octane flatpicking sound in mainstream bluegrass and earning multiple IBMA Guitar Player of the Year awards and a Grammy.[1][4] Billy Strings came to prominence roughly 15 years later, initially gaining attention while touring with mandolinist Don Julin before launching a solo career that fused traditional bluegrass with improvisational jam, rock, and even metal influences, quickly becoming one of the most talked‑about younger artists in the genre.[2][3][6][7]

Their musical relationship began when Sutton discovered a YouTube clip of Strings playing “Freeborn Man” at a Folk Alliance showcase, immediately recognizing both his technical command and fiery stage presence.[2] Strings, for his part, had long admired Sutton’s work—especially the solo on “Get Up, John” from Ricky Skaggs’ album *Bluegrass Rules!*—and regarded him as one of the defining modern flatpickers whose recordings he studied closely.[2][3] After an acclaimed duet set at Nashville’s Station Inn in January 2020 convinced any remaining skeptics of Strings’ depth as a guitarist, the two guitarists deepened their collaboration, ultimately recording the live duo album *Billy Strings & Bryan Sutton: Live at the Legion*, captured at American Legion Post 82 in Nashville and released in 2025.[2][3][5] That project, along with their co‑led single “The Devil Went Down to Deep Gap,” showcases their shared love of Doc Watson, classic bluegrass repertoire, and boundary‑pushing arrangements that nod to heavy metal while remaining rooted in acoustic tradition.[3][5][6]

As a duo, Sutton and Strings embody a living dialogue between bluegrass generations: Sutton extending the flatpicking lineage of Clarence White, Tony Rice, and Doc Watson into the 21st century, and Strings channeling those same roots through a modern lens that incorporates jam‑band energy and rock‑influenced improvisation.[1][3][6][7] Their performances together emphasize spontaneous interplay, encyclopedic knowledge of traditional songs (from Mac Wiseman and Larry Sparks to the Delmore Brothers), and a shared commitment to keeping bluegrass both historically grounded and creatively forward‑looking.[2][3] While each continues to lead his own band and career, the Bryan Sutton & Billy Strings collaboration has quickly become a touchstone for contemporary acoustic guitar, illustrating how master and protégé can meet as equals onstage and help define the future of bluegrass.[1][2][3][6][7]

## Fun Facts
- Bryan Sutton has been called “the most accomplished and awarded acoustic guitarist of his generation,” winning nine International Bluegrass Music Association Guitar Player of the Year awards as well as a Grammy, while still preferring the low‑key life of a session musician and educator over constant heavy touring.[1][4][6]
- Billy Strings first came to broader attention in part through informal online videos—Sutton recalls discovering him via a YouTube clip of Strings tearing through “Freeborn Man” in a hotel‑room showcase at a Folk Alliance conference.[2]
- The first time many skeptics were fully convinced of Billy Strings’ depth as a guitarist was a duet show with Bryan Sutton at Nashville’s Station Inn in January 2020, a performance remembered as a turning point in how the bluegrass community perceived Strings’ instrumental prowess.[3]
- Their track “The Devil Went Down to Deep Gap” is not just a playful remake of “The Devil Went Down to Georgia”; it doubles as a tribute to Doc Watson and Del McCoury and even features Sutton and Strings handling the song’s heavy‑metal‑style sections on acoustic instruments, underscoring their shared love of both bluegrass and metal.[5][6]

## Musical Connections

### Mentors/Influences
- [[doc_watson|Doc Watson]] - Foundational stylistic influence and personal connection for Sutton, and a central musical hero for both Sutton and Strings, shaping their flatpicking, repertoire choices, and sense of bluegrass tradition. (Referenced in Sutton–Strings conversations and explicitly honored in their tribute track “The Devil Went Down to Deep Gap,” which is framed as a Doc Watson tribute.[3][5][6]) [Doc Watson’s influence spans Sutton’s formative years through his MerleFest appearances from the mid‑1990s onward, and continues as an explicit influence on both artists into the 2020s.[3][6]]
- [[tony_rice|Tony Rice]] - Major flatpicking role model for Sutton; Sutton has been described as a comparable hero for the next generation in the way Tony Rice was for him, and Strings is part of that subsequent generation shaped by the Rice–Sutton lineage. (Cited in Sutton’s official bio as one of the key players whose model he inherited and internalized; Sutton also shared the stage with Rice at events like the Vassar Clements 75th Birthday Jam at MerleFest.[1][3]) [Rice’s influence on Sutton dates from Sutton’s youth through his professional emergence in the 1990s and into his mature career; by extension, this lineage reaches Strings as he comes of age in the 2000s–2010s.[1][3]]
- [[clarence_white|Clarence White]] - Important historical flatpicking influence on Sutton’s style, part of the core lineage he bridges between 20th‑century bluegrass traditions and modern roots music that informs both his playing and what Strings studied. (Named in Sutton’s bio alongside Tony Rice as a key model whose technically demanding style Sutton absorbed and extended.[1]) [Primarily a formative influence on Sutton’s development before and during his 1990s rise, with that aesthetic passing forward to younger players like Strings through Sutton’s recordings and performances.[1][3]]

### Key Collaborators
- [[ricky_skaggs_and_kentucky_thunder|Ricky Skaggs & Kentucky Thunder]] - Sutton’s breakout role as lead guitarist in Skaggs’ band established his reputation and produced recordings that heavily influenced Billy Strings’ early listening and study.

- [[hot_rize|Hot Rize]] - Legendary bluegrass quartet that Sutton joined as guitarist, solidifying his standing as a core figure in modern bluegrass and connecting him with a wider network of top‑tier acoustic musicians. (Touring and recording with Hot Rize after joining in 2002, carrying on the guitar role previously held by Charles Sawtelle.[3][4]) [Sutton began working with Hot Rize in 2002 and has continued to tour and record with them in the years since, missing only one show after their re‑formation.[3][4]]
- [[jerry_douglas|Jerry Douglas]] - Frequent collaborator and peer in the acoustic/bluegrass world; Douglas has worked with Sutton on various projects and was an early public champion of Billy Strings, reinforcing the Sutton–Strings connection. (Douglas recounted in an interview that Sutton was the one who told him “Here’s the future of bluegrass, Billy Strings,” highlighting Sutton’s role in bringing Strings to the attention of established greats.[3]) [Their professional overlap dates back to Sutton’s mid‑1990s Nashville session period and continues through interviews and collaborative appearances into the late 2010s.[3]]
