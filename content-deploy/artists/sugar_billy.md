## Biography
Sugar Billy is the recording name of **Willie (or William) Garner**, a little‑documented 1970s soul‑funk singer and guitarist from **Detroit, Michigan, USA**.[2][4] Contemporary accounts and later reissue notes agree that he was active in the mid‑1970s, cutting an album’s worth of material built around his song “Super Duper Love,” which blended driving funk rhythms, sweet soul melodies and playful, romantic lyrics.[1][2][4] Issued around 1974–1975, the album (often referred to by collectors as *Super Duper Love*) and its lead single failed to make a commercial impact at the time, but showcased Garner’s gritty yet tuneful vocal delivery and his own guitar work on the sessions.[1]

Very little verifiable personal information about Garner’s early life, training or later years survives in public sources; fan and blog commentary consistently note that “not much is known” about him beyond his Detroit base and 1970s recordings.[1][2][4] Some sources suggest he had worked in production before stepping out as a solo artist and later left the music business entirely, but these accounts are anecdotal and not well‑documented.[1] Despite this obscurity, his track “Super Duper Love (Part 1 & 2)” developed a second life among soul and funk collectors and was propelled into broader recognition when British singer Joss Stone covered it in 2003, bringing renewed attention to Garner’s small but distinctive recorded legacy.[1][2] Today, his work is remembered as a cult slice of Detroit‑rooted 1970s funk and soul, prized for its groove, warmth and rarity.[2][4]

## Fun Facts
- Sugar Billy’s real name is Willie (or William) Garner, and he is known to have come from Detroit, Michigan, despite the lack of detailed public biographical records.[1][2][4]
- He recorded essentially a full album’s worth of material in 1975 centered around “Super Duper Love,” then effectively vanished from the music scene, leaving only this small but highly regarded body of work.[2]
- Collectors and bloggers note that Sugar Billy played the guitar on his signature track “Super Duper Love,” adding to its reputation as a tightly crafted independent soul‑funk production.[1]
- British singer Joss Stone’s 2003 cover of “Super Duper Love” (retitled “Super Duper Love (Are You Diggin’ on Me?)”) significantly boosted interest in the original recording and helped secure Sugar Billy a posthumous cult following among soul and funk fans.[1][2]
