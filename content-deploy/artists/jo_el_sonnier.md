## Biography
Jo-El Sonnier (October 2, 1946 – January 13, 2024) was born near Rayne, Louisiana, to poor French-speaking sharecroppers and raised in extreme poverty, often working in cotton fields. He began playing his older brother's battered accordion at age three, made his first radio appearance at six on Crowley station KSIG, and recorded his debut at eleven. By twelve, he wrote the Cajun classic 'Tes Yeux Bleus' (also known as 'Tee Yeaux Bleu'), and as a teenager, he released independent recordings on regional Louisiana labels, establishing himself as a Cajun prodigy who performed at house dances transitioning to larger fais do-dos in the 1940s and 1950s.[1][2][3][4][6][7]

Sonnier's career bridged Cajun and country music, starting with a Mercury Records contract in 1970 that yielded limited success, followed by critical acclaim in the late 1970s on Rounder Records. He returned to country in the 1980s with RCA, achieving top-ten hits like 'No More One More Time' and 'Tear-Stained Letter' (a Richard Thompson cover), and opened for Merle Haggard. In the late 1990s, he rejoined Rounder for Cajun albums, earning Grammy nominations for *Cajun Pride* (1997), *Cajun Blood* (2001), and others, winning Best Regional Roots Music Album for *The Legacy* (2013). Over 60 years, he released 35 albums, blending accordion-driven Cajun traditions with country, rock, and pop influences, and toured worldwide, including the Grand Ole Opry, New Orleans Jazz Festival, Europe, and South America.[1][2][3][4]

Known as the 'King of Cajun Music,' Sonnier was inducted into the Cajun French Music Association Hall of Fame (2008) and Louisiana Music Hall of Fame (2009). His songs were covered by Emmylou Harris, Johnny Cash, and Jerry Lee Lewis, and he served as an ambassador preserving Cajun heritage after pioneers like Iry LeJeune and Lawrence Walker. He performed until his death from a heart attack at 77 after a show, embodying his philosophy: 'I perform every show as if it was my last.'[1][2][3][5][7]

## Fun Facts
- Wrote the Cajun classic 'Tes Yeux Bleus' ('Tee Yeaux Bleu') at age 12 after his bandleader demanded one more song during a session, releasing it at 13.[1][2]
- Experienced a pivotal moment at the early 1970s San Diego Folk Festival, inspiring him to become a Cajun ambassador beyond Louisiana to honor lost heroes like Iry LeJeune.[2]
- First major Cajun artist to bring the accordion as his primary instrument to Nashville country music, bridging genres like Jimmy C. Newman (guitar) and Doug Kershaw (fiddle).[2][3]
- Authored 'The Little Boy Under The Wagon,' a children's book based on his impoverished childhood, and released a Cajun cookbook plus 'Ayeee' Cajun Power Sauce in 2018.[4]
