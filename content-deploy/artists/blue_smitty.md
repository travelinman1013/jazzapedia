# BLUE SMITTY

## Biography
Claude 'Blue Smitty' Smith was born on November 6, 1924, in Marietta, Arkansas (reportedly Marietta, AK, likely a reference to Arkansas), and grew up in Chicago before moving back to Arkansas as a teenager. He described his guitar skills as a natural 'gift,' developing into a powerful singer and guitarist who played a key role in transitioning blues from acoustic to electric styles in post-WWII Chicago.[1][2][3][6] Smith returned to Chicago, where he built his career in the vibrant blues scene, associating closely with influential figures like Muddy Waters, which led to session work at Chess Studios.[1]

In July 1952, Blue Smitty recorded four songs for Chess, including the single 'Sad Story' c/w 'Crying,' though further releases were overshadowed by stars like Little Walter. His confident vocals and accomplished electric guitar lines on these tracks became staples in Chicago blues compilations, exemplifying the genre's evolution, but his solo career never gained major traction despite decades of performing around Illinois.[1][2] He gave insightful interviews to Living Blues magazine in the 1970s, sharing his experiences, yet remained underrecognized, often confused with other 'Smitty' blues artists like Byther Smith.[1][6]

Blue Smitty continued playing locally until his death on December 5, 2007, in Joliet, Illinois, leaving a legacy as a skilled contributor to electric blues whose talents echoed faintly in blues history.[1][5]

## Fun Facts
- Blue Smitty's song 'Date Bait' was covered multiple times but never released by Chess Records.[1]
- His 1952 Chess recordings, including 'Sad Story' and 'Crying,' were sidelined when Little Walter's 'Juke' topped the Billboard R&B charts the following month.[1]
- Despite his skills, he was often confused with other blues artists using the 'Smitty' moniker, such as Byther Smith, Doug Smith, and 'Big Bad Smitty'.[1]
- He performed under the alias 'Blue Smitty and His String Men' early in his career.[5]
