# THE JOHNNY SMITH QUINTET

## Biography
The Johnny Smith Quintet was the primary small-group vehicle for American jazz guitarist Johnny Henry Smith II, a key figure in cool and mainstream jazz guitar in the 1950s and early 1960s.[1][2][5] Born in Birmingham, Alabama in 1922 and raised in Portland, Maine, Smith was largely self‑taught on guitar and became a professional musician as a teenager, working in local bands before serving in the U.S. Army Air Forces during World War II.[1][5] After the war he moved to New York, where his extraordinary reading ability and stylistic versatility won him a position as staff guitarist, arranger and sometime trumpeter with NBC beginning in the late 1940s, playing everything from orchestral scores to commercial studio dates.[1][2][5][7]

Around this period Smith began recording under his own name, often using the Johnny Smith Quintet designation for his Roost Records sessions, most famously the 1952 album "Moonlight in Vermont" featuring Stan Getz, which became one of the best‑selling jazz records of its time and a landmark of relaxed, lyrical cool jazz guitar.[2][3][5] The Quintet settings showcased Smith’s clear, bell‑like tone, advanced chord voicings, and seamless blend of melodic single‑note lines with harmonically rich accompaniment, typically supported by tenor saxophone, bass, drums, and sometimes piano.[2][3][5] Though he did not think of himself strictly as a jazz musician, his work with the Quintet placed him alongside the leading guitar innovators of the era and helped define a refined, harmonically sophisticated small‑group sound that bridged swing, bebop, and cool jazz.[4][5]

In the mid‑ to late 1950s Smith chose to step back from the New York scene, relocating to Colorado Springs in 1957 to open a music store and focus on teaching and a more settled life, though he continued to record and perform selectively, often still under the Johnny Smith Quintet banner when leading small ensembles.[5][6][8] His cool yet highly controlled style, as heard on Quintet recordings like "Moonlight in Vermont" and his composition "Walk, Don’t Run" (later a rock‑era hit for The Ventures), became a touchstone for generations of jazz guitarists and influenced both instrument design and electric guitar sound in jazz.[1][2][3][5] Today the Johnny Smith Quintet is remembered less as a fixed band than as the signature context in which Smith’s distinctive musical voice—technically immaculate, harmonically rich, and emotionally restrained—was most clearly documented on record.[1][2][5]


## Fun Facts
- Johnny Smith wrote the tune "Walk, Don’t Run" in 1954; six years later, The Ventures turned it into a Top 10 rock instrumental hit, providing Smith with crucial royalty income just after an accident in which he lost the tip of his ring finger.[1][2][3]
- Despite being known primarily as a guitarist, Smith became first cornetist in a U.S. Army Air Forces band within about six months of picking up the instrument during World War II, after the group needed a cornet player more than a guitarist.[5]
- Smith designed or co‑designed several high‑end archtop guitars, working first with Epiphone on the Emperor Concert and later lending his name and specifications to signature models by Guild, Gibson, Benedetto, and Heritage, many of which are now highly prized by jazz guitarists.[3][5]
- Although widely regarded as one of the greatest jazz guitarists and an architect of cool‑jazz guitar, Smith himself did not consider his primary identity to be that of a jazz musician, reflecting his comfort across classical, pop, and studio work as well as jazz.[5]

## Musical Connections

### Mentors/Influences
- [[django_reinhardt|Django Reinhardt]] - Early stylistic influence; Smith learned Reinhardt’s solos from records and later met him when Reinhardt visited the United States in 1946, absorbing aspects of his phrasing and melodic approach. (Influence heard across Johnny Smith Quintet recordings such as "Moonlight in Vermont" and other Roost sessions, where Smith’s fluid single‑note lines and lyricism echo Reinhardt’s impact rather than specific joint projects.) [c. late 1930s–1940s (influence), meeting in 1946]
- [[charlie_christian|Charlie Christian]] - Major guitar influence in Smith’s formative years, shaping his conception of electric guitar phrasing, linear improvisation, and integration into small jazz groups. (Christian’s influence is reflected broadly in Johnny Smith Quintet performances and recordings for Roost Records, where Smith’s clear, horn‑like lines parallel Christian’s earlier electric guitar innovations.) [c. early 1940s onward (influence)]

### Key Collaborators
- [[stan_getz|Stan Getz]] - Tenor saxophonist and key frontline partner on Johnny Smith Quintet recordings; their collaboration on "Moonlight in Vermont" became Smith’s signature statement and a defining cool‑jazz document. (Album "Moonlight in Vermont" (Roost, 1952) credited to Johnny Smith with Stan Getz, often associated with the Johnny Smith Quintet identity.[2][3][5]) [Early 1950s (especially 1952 sessions)]
- [[eddie_safranski|Eddie Safranski]] - Bassist on Smith’s early leader date that produced "Moonlight in Vermont," providing the rhythmic and harmonic foundation for the small‑group sound associated with the Johnny Smith Quintet. ("Moonlight in Vermont" session for Roost Records and related early 1950s small‑group recordings under Smith’s leadership.[5]) [Early 1950s]
- [[sanford_gold|Sanford Gold]] - Pianist on Smith’s landmark early quintet recordings, contributing subtle harmonic support and interplay with Smith’s guitar. ("Moonlight in Vermont" and associated 1952 Roost sessions under Johnny Smith’s leadership.[5]) [Early 1950s]
- [[don_lamond|Don Lamond]] - Drummer on Smith’s key early leader date, shaping the relaxed but swinging rhythmic feel that became associated with his quintet recordings. ("Moonlight in Vermont" session for Roost Records and related Johnny Smith small‑group recordings.[5]) [Early 1950s]
- [[benny_goodman|Benny Goodman]] - Smith performed with Goodman in New York studio and club settings, bringing his guitar voice into Goodman’s ensembles; though not a standing quintet member, this collaboration informed Smith’s small‑group experience. (Various performances and broadcasts with the Benny Goodman orchestra and small groups during Smith’s NBC/studio years (specific commercially issued Quintet‑branded recordings are not singled out in the sources).) [Late 1940s–early 1950s[2][7]]

### Artists Influenced
- [[jim_hall|Jim Hall]] - Frequently cites Johnny Smith as a formative influence; Hall’s own cool, harmonically rich style and emphasis on melodic clarity reflect the precedent set by Smith’s quintet recordings. (The influence is stylistic rather than tied to a single work; commentators note Smith as a major early model for Hall’s later recordings such as "Undercurrent" and "Intermodulation."[5]) [Hall’s formative years in the 1950s and ongoing acknowledgment thereafter]
- [[mundell_lowe_and_contemporaneous_jazz_guitarists|Mundell Lowe and contemporaneous jazz guitarists]] - Contemporary and slightly younger guitarists have acknowledged Smith’s impact on chord voicings, tone production, and the integration of guitar into cool‑jazz small groups. (Influence heard broadly across their 1950s–1960s small‑group recordings, reflecting harmonic and textural concepts popularized on Johnny Smith Quintet dates.[5]) [1950s onward]
- [[guitar_makers_and_later_jazz_guitarists_using_signature_models|Guitar makers and later jazz guitarists using signature models]] - Smith’s collaboration with builders such as Guild, Gibson, Benedetto, and Heritage on signature "Johnny Smith" models shaped the sound and setup preferences of many jazz guitarists who adopted these instruments. (Use of Johnny Smith‑model guitars on recordings by various jazz players, reflecting his setup, neck dimensions, and acoustic‑electric balance.[3][5]) [1960s onward (instrument influence continuing into later decades)]
