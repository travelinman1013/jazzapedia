# Swim Surreal & Zero 7

## Biography
Swim Surreal, the stage name of singer-songwriter Thomas Leonard (also known as Tom Leonard or Tommy Leonard), is a California-based west coast artist who emerged into prominence through his collaboration with the English downtempo duo Zero 7, consisting of Henry Binns and Sam Hardaker. Zero 7 formed in 1997 after Binns and Hardaker, who studied sound engineering, began their careers in the 1990s at RAK Studios in London, working with acts like Pet Shop Boys, Young Disciples, and Robert Plant. Their debut remix for Radiohead's 'Climbing Up the Walls' marked the origin of the Zero 7 name, inspired by a bar called Cero Siete on the Honduran island of Utila. Swim Surreal and Zero 7 first connected in 2013, co-writing tracks including 'Don't Call It Love,' which was initially released as a white label 12-inch vinyl.[2][3][4]

The partnership culminated in 2024 with the album *In the Half Light*, Zero 7's first full-length since 2009's *Yeah Ghost*, featuring nine co-written and produced songs with Swim Surreal, including singles 'The Crowd,' 'Bloom,' and 'Don't Call It Love.' Zero 7's musical style blends downtempo, trip hop, and electronic elements, evolving from their platinum-certified debut *Simple Things* (2001) with vocalists like Sia, Mozez, and Sophie Barker, to subsequent releases like *When It Falls* (2004) and *The Garden* (2006), earning Mercury Prize and Grammy nominations. Swim Surreal's contributions bring a sultry, sonic storytelling approach, embracing mystery in their joint work.[1][2][4][5]

This collaboration represents a significant revival for Zero 7, who had explored side projects like Ingrid Eto, Kling, and Equador in the interim, while Swim Surreal gains wider exposure through this established act. Their shared legacy underscores a fusion of UK electronic roots with California indie sensibilities, continuing Zero 7's tradition of vocalist partnerships.

## Fun Facts
