# George Duke

## Biography
George Martin Duke was born on January 12, 1946, in San Francisco, California, and began piano training at age seven after seeing Duke Ellington perform, drawing early influences from black church music and jazz figures like Miles Davis, Les McCann, and Cal Tjader. He attended the San Francisco Conservatory of Music, earning a bachelor's degree in 1967, followed by a master's in composition from San Francisco State University. In his early career, Duke played in San Francisco clubs with artists like Al Jarreau, Letta Mbulu, Sonny Rollins, and Dexter Gordon, released his first album in 1966, and collaborated with Jean-Luc Ponty on *The Jean-Luc Ponty Experience with the George Duke Trio*, gaining attention from Frank Zappa and Cannonball Adderley, whom he joined in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

Duke's career evolved through stints with Zappa's Mothers of Invention (1967-1969 and 1973-1975), Cannonball Adderley, Billy Cobham's fusion band, and a pivotal partnership with Stanley Clarke in the 1980s, blending jazz fusion, funk, R&B, and pop. His solo breakthrough came with 1976's *From Me to You* and the 1978 gold album *Reach for It*, which charted high and expanded his audience. As a producer from the late 1970s, he achieved massive success with A Taste of Honey's 'Sukiyaki' (No. 1 hit, over 2 million copies), Jeffrey Osborne ('Stay With Me Tonight,' 'On The Wings Of Love'), Deniece Williams ('Let's Hear It For The Boy'), and later Grammy-winning work like Dianne Reeves' *In The Moment* (2001). His style innovated keyboard sounds with synthesizers like Moog and ARP, pioneering chord changes and note bending in jazz fusion.

Duke's legacy spans over 32 solo albums, musical direction for artists and events like Soul Train Awards and Montreux Jazz Festival tours, teaching roles, film scores (e.g., *Never Die Alone*), and performances with orchestras. He earned Grammy nominations and wins, promoted HIV/AIDS awareness in India (2005), and continued touring and producing until his death on August 5, 2013, leaving an indelible mark on jazz, funk, and R&B.
