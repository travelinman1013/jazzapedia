# Jonathon Boogie Long

## Biography
Jonathon "Boogie" Long is an American blues rock singer, guitarist, and songwriter born in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, who has become a prominent figure in contemporary blues music. Raised in a Southern Baptist community, Long demonstrated exceptional musical talent from an early age, picking up the guitar at six years old to teach himself gospel songs he heard at church. His father purchased his first guitar when Long was around eight, leading to formal lessons and his first public performance at age ten at the local venue Swamp Mama's alongside blues legends Kenny Neal, Rudy Richard, and Lil Ray Neal. At fourteen, with his parents' consent, Long left school to pursue music professionally, touring as a bass guitarist with Henry Turner Jr. from 2003 to 2005, establishing himself as a serious musician during his formative years.

Following his early touring experience, Long expanded his musical horizons by performing on the Chitlin' Circuit with notable artists including Chris Duarte, Kenny Wayne Shepherd, and Tyree Neal, while also backing Luther Kent and performing with the college circuit band 2Hipnotic. In 2011, he achieved significant recognition by winning Guitar Center's "King of the Blues" competition, honoring him as the top unsigned blues guitarist in America. Long released his debut album, *Jonathon "Boogie" Long & the Blues Revolution*, in April 2013, which introduced his backing ensemble and established his recording presence. Since then, he has released six additional collections, including *Trying to Get There* (2016), *Jonathon Long* (2018), and *Parables of a Southern Man* (2021), with multiple albums reaching top ten positions on the Billboard Top Blues Albums Chart. In November 2019, Long was inducted into the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame, cementing his status as a significant contributor to blues music.

Long's musical style has evolved beyond traditional blues into a unique blend of blues rock, southern rock, and Americana, characterized by his distinctive guitar work, powerful vocals, and introspective songwriting. Critics have noted his ability to combine high-intensity blues-rock performance with emotional depth and conversational guitar playing that reflects Louisiana's musical heritage. He has shared the stage with blues legends including B.B. King, ZZ Top, Robert Cray, Joe Bonamassa, Dr. John, and Rockin' Dopsie, establishing himself as a respected performer within the blues community. Beyond music, Long has also ventured into film, co-starring in the independent fictional film *We Are Kings* (2014), and created instructional content through the three-DVD set *Boogie Blues Magic* (2013), demonstrating his commitment to preserving and teaching blues guitar traditions.
