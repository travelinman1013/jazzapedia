## Biography
Zygos Brass Band is a contemporary brass band project that blends the street-parade energy of New Orleans second line traditions with a distinctly French sensibility. The group has been described as “a New Orleans brass band with a Frenchie little sound,” reflecting both its stylistic roots in New Orleans jazz and brass band culture and its European origin.[5][7] Their music draws on festive jazz, carnival atmospheres, and the rhythmic drive of parades and second line processions, often presented with a modern, urban edge that incorporates hip‑hop dance and performance elements.[6]

Active in live performance rather than the mainstream recording industry, Zygos Brass Band has built its identity around high‑energy shows that evoke the spirit of New Orleans street music, adapted for French and European audiences.[5][7] Their album “From and In,” released through the Louisiana Music Factory catalog, situates them within the broader New Orleans–oriented brass band scene even as they operate from abroad, underscoring an ongoing cultural exchange between New Orleans traditions and international brass band practitioners.[4] While detailed individual member biographies, formal early‑career timelines, and long‑term legacy assessments are not documented in available sources, existing materials consistently present Zygos Brass Band as a festive, dance‑centered ensemble dedicated to transmitting New Orleans brass band culture through a French/European lens.[4][5][6][7]
