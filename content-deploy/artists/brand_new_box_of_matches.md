# BRAND NEW BOX OF MATCHES

## Biography
Brand New Box of Matches is a contemporary bluegrass act based in Knoxville, Tennessee, centered around the duo of multi‑instrumentalist **Ryan Hardison** and vocalist/bassist **Elizabeth Sherman**.[1][3][4] Emerging from East Tennessee’s fertile acoustic scene, the group built its reputation in regional venues and on local radio showcases such as WDVX’s “Blue Plate Special,” where their tight vocal blend and stripped‑down instrumentation drew attention from bluegrass audiences.[1][5] Their work reflects a mix of traditional Appalachian roots and modern songwriting, with Sherman’s “lovely vocals” especially noted on slower, more haunting ballads.[1]

Musically, Brand New Box of Matches operates in the classic bluegrass format—banjo, guitar, and upright bass—while emphasizing duet singing and song‑driven arrangements rather than purely virtuosic instrumental breaks.[1][3] Hardison covers banjo and guitar duties, and Sherman anchors the sound on bass, with the two trading lead and harmony lines to create an intimate but full ensemble texture.[3] Their recordings and seasonal singles, including multiple Christmas releases, show a willingness to move between straight‑ahead bluegrass, rootsy acoustic country, and atmospheric ballads, positioning the group as an independent, award‑winning voice in the Knoxville bluegrass community.[1][4]

As an independent, relatively low‑profile band, Brand New Box of Matches’ broader legacy is still developing, but their work contributes to maintaining and updating the regional bluegrass tradition in East Tennessee. By foregrounding original material and contemporary song choices within a recognizable bluegrass framework, they help bridge long‑standing genre conventions with newer audiences, especially through live radio appearances and digital releases.[1][3][5]

## Fun Facts
