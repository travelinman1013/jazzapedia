## Quick Info

- **Followers**: 12,447
- **Origin**: Boston, Massachusetts, United States (regional disco scene context; precise origin of the project not explicitly documented)

## Biography
Available evidence indicates that Carrie Mims & Herb Lee River Junction were a short‑lived, small‑label disco/post‑disco studio or local band project active in the early 1980s, rather than a long‑running, well‑documented touring act.[1][7][8] Their known work is associated with Boston’s underground disco and boogie scene and has been re‑contextualized decades later by reissue and compilation projects focused on obscure Massachusetts dance records.[2][7] Specific details about the individual members’ early lives, formal training, or non‑recorded career activities are not documented in accessible sources, suggesting they were typical of many regional disco-era musicians who worked primarily on the local circuit and in studio projects.

The group is best known today for the tracks **“Get Up & Dance Don’t Want No Party Poo‑Pershere”** and **“I’m Gonna Get You (Meeow)”**, originally issued on small labels (including Bean City Records) around 1982 and later revived via DJ/producer Serge Gamesbourg’s compilation **“Boston Goes Disco!”**.[1][2][7][8] Their music fits squarely within early‑’80s disco and post‑disco aesthetics: upbeat dance‑floor arrangements, playful and sometimes kitsch lyrical concepts, and an energetic, party‑oriented vocal approach.[1][4] While they never achieved mainstream recognition, the rediscovery of their 45s by collectors and DJs has given the project a modest cult legacy as part of the broader story of Boston’s overlooked disco and boogie output in the 1970s–80s.[2][7]

Because no primary biographical profiles, interviews, or label notes about the personal histories of Carrie Mims, Herb Lee, or the other River Junction musicians appear in publicly indexed sources, it is not currently possible to provide a verified, detailed narrative of their early lives or later careers beyond these recording credits and compilation appearances.[1][2][7][8]

## Fun Facts
- Their song titles are notably eccentric and playful, especially "I'm Gonna Get You (Meeow)" and "Get Up & Dance Don't Want No Party Poo-Pershere," which have been highlighted by modern reviewers and compilers as especially wild even by disco standards.[1][2][4]
- The track "I'm Gonna Get You (Meeow)" was described by a contemporary reviewer as a "kitsch but vivacious" feline-themed groover, underscoring the band’s blend of novelty and genuine dance-floor appeal.[4]
- DJ and compiler Serge Gamesbourg has called discovering the Carrie Mims & Herb Lee River Junction 45 of "I'm Gonna Get You (Meeow)" his most mind-blowing local find while digging Boston records, and he recounts tracking down the rights and remaining copies as a small detective story in the compilation’s liner notes.[2]
- Modern radio and specialty shows, including WWOZ in New Orleans, have continued to play the Serge Gamesbourg edit of "I'm Gonna Get You (Meeow)," giving the once-obscure local record a second life on contemporary playlists decades after its original release.[6]
