## Biography
Kris Kristofferson (June 22, 1936 – September 28, 2024) was an American singer‑songwriter, actor, and key architect of the 1970s **outlaw country** movement, known for his rugged baritone voice and literate, emotionally direct songwriting.[2][3] Born in Brownsville, Texas, into a military family—his father was a U.S. Air Force major general—he excelled as both an athlete and scholar, becoming a Golden Gloves boxer, football player, ROTC cadet commander, and award‑winning short‑story writer at Pomona College in California.[1][2][3] He earned a Rhodes Scholarship to the University of Oxford, where he studied literature and the poetry of William Blake, an influence that helped shape his blend of plainspoken country storytelling with poetic, sometimes existential themes.[1][2][3] After Oxford he followed family tradition into the U.S. Army in 1960, training as an Army Ranger and helicopter pilot in West Germany and reaching the rank of captain.[1][2] Offered a post teaching English at West Point, he instead resigned his commission in the mid‑1960s and moved to Nashville to pursue songwriting full‑time, working day jobs—including sweeping floors as a janitor at Columbia Studios—while trying to break into the music business.[1][2][3]

In Nashville, Kristofferson’s fiercely crafted songs began to attract attention from established artists, notably **Johnny Cash**, who championed his work and introduced him to a wider audience at the 1969 Newport Folk Festival.[1][2] By the early 1970s he had emerged as one of country music’s most respected songwriters, penning modern standards such as “Me and Bobby McGee,” “Help Me Make It Through the Night,” “For the Good Times,” and “Sunday Mornin’ Comin’ Down,” many of them becoming major hits for other performers and earning him Grammy Awards and multiple high‑profile nominations.[2][5] As a recording artist, his own albums in the 1970s showcased a **gravelly, conversational vocal style** and jazz‑inflected phrasing that were unconventional for Nashville at the time, pairing rough‑hewn vocals with introspective, often socially aware lyrics.[2][5] Parallel to his music, he built a substantial film career, appearing in works such as *Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid* (1973), *Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore* (1974), *A Star Is Born* (1976)—for which he won a Golden Globe—*Heaven’s Gate* (1980), and later *Lone Star* (1996) and the *Blade* series.[2]

By the 1980s, Kristofferson’s legacy as an “outlaw poet” was cemented when he joined Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, and Willie Nelson in the country supergroup **The Highwaymen**, whose 1985 single and album *Highwayman* both reached number one on the *Billboard* country charts and helped define the outlaw country supergroup template.[1][2][3] Throughout his life he was noted not only for his music and acting but also for his engagement with progressive causes, including human rights and social justice.[1] His songwriting—marked by vulnerability, moral ambiguity, and a literary sensibility—reshaped expectations of what country lyrics could tackle and influenced generations of artists across country, folk, and Americana. Kristofferson spent many of his later years living on Maui, Hawaii, continuing to perform and record into his 70s and 80s, and is widely regarded as one of the most important American songwriters of the late 20th century.[2][3]

## Fun Facts
- Kristofferson earned a prestigious Rhodes Scholarship and studied English literature at the University of Oxford, focusing on the poetry of William Blake before ever becoming known as a songwriter.[2][3]
- Before his music career took off, he worked as a janitor at Columbia Studios in Nashville, sweeping floors and emptying ashtrays while trying to get established as a songwriter.[1][3]
- A famous story—often repeated by Johnny Cash’s circle—claims that Kristofferson once landed a helicopter on Cash’s property just to hand him a demo tape, a tale that has become part of Nashville folklore.[3]
- His first song, written at age 11 in Brownsville, Texas, was humorously titled “I Hate Your Ugly Face,” which he later included as a bonus track on one of his later albums.[3]

- [[william_blake_literary_influence|William Blake (literary influence)]] - Kristofferson studied Blake’s poetry at Oxford; Blake’s blend of spirituality, social critique, and vivid imagery influenced his literary approach to songwriting. (General influence on the poetic and philosophical tone of songs like “Me and Bobby McGee” and “Help Me Make It Through the Night.”) [Mid–late 1950s (Oxford years) and ongoing influence]

### Key Collaborators

(Cash’s hit version of “Sunday Mornin’ Comin’ Down”; The Highwaymen albums *Highwayman* (1985), *Highwayman 2* (1990), *The Road Goes On Forever* (1995).) [Late 1960s–1990s]
- [[willie_nelson|Willie Nelson]] - Fellow outlaw country star and member of The Highwaymen, collaborating on recordings and tours that defined the supergroup era. (The Highwaymen albums *Highwayman* (1985), *Highwayman 2* (1990), *The Road Goes On Forever* (1995).) [1980s–1990s]

(Songs such as “Me and Bobby McGee,” “Help Me Make It Through the Night,” and “Sunday Mornin’ Comin’ Down,” as well as his role in The Highwaymen, became templates for more introspective, ruggedly independent country writing.) [1970s onward]
