## Biography
Josh Johnson, born in 1990 in Alexandria, Louisiana, initially pursued theater lighting design at Centenary College in Shreveport before pivoting to comedy. After graduating, he honed his craft in Chicago's comedy scene, making his late-night debut as a writer and performer on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon in 2017. His sharp observational humor, blending stand-up with social and political commentary, quickly gained traction, earning him accolades like Comedy Central's 'Comic to Watch' in 2015, 'New Face' at Just for Laughs in 2016, and New York's Funniest at the New York Comedy Festival in 2018[1][2][3].

Johnson's career skyrocketed with his role as a staff writer on The Daily Show starting in 2017, where he contributed during Trevor Noah's tenure before advancing to correspondent in 2024 and entering the weekly host rotation in 2025. He toured with Trevor Noah on the 'Loud & Clear' tour and released notable projects including his 2017 half-hour Comedy Central special, the 2018 Netflix Comedy Lineup quarter-hour, hour-long specials '# (Hashtag)' in 2021 and 'Up Here Killing Myself' in 2023, and the innovative self-released comedy-music mixtape album Elusive in 2021, which fuses live stand-up with original musical compositions exploring political and social themes[1][2][3][5]. An Emmy-nominated writer, NAACP award-winner, and Comedy Central's most-watched comedian with over 40 million views, Johnson headlines theaters worldwide, performs regularly at The Comedy Cellar in New York, and co-hosts podcasts like The Josh Johnson Show with Logan Nielsen and Hold Up with Dulcé Sloan[2][3][6].

Based in New York, Johnson's versatile style—rooted in stand-up but extending into music, writing, and acting—has established him as a comedic powerhouse, with viral stories like 'Catfishing the KKK' amassing millions of views and projects like the short-form series GENIES co-created with Luke Mones[3][5].
