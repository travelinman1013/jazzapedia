# Savoy Family Band

## Biography
The **Savoy Family Band** (often billed as the **Savoy Family Cajun Band**) is a family ensemble from Eunice, Louisiana, built around accordion maker and player **Marc Savoy**, his wife, singer‑guitarist and scholar **Ann Savoy**, and their sons **Joel** and **Wilson** Savoy.[1][3][4] Marc, born in 1940 on a rice farm near Eunice, grew up immersed in French‑speaking Cajun culture, learning fiddle from his grandfather and later teaching himself accordion; by the mid‑1960s he was building his own instruments and had opened the Savoy Music Center, which became both a workshop and a social hub for Cajun musicians worldwide.[1][2][3] Ann, originally from Richmond, Virginia, fell in love with Cajun music in the mid‑1970s after discovering recordings by artists like the Balfa Brothers and Clifton Chenier; she moved to Louisiana, married Marc in 1975, and quickly became both a performer and an important documentarian of Cajun and Creole traditions.[2][5]  

The Savoy Family Band coalesced when Joel and Wilson were preteens and the family performed together at a friend’s birthday party, an informal gig that became their *official* debut as a unit.[3] Each member is a multi‑instrumentalist: Marc on accordion, Ann on guitar, fiddle, autoharp, dulcimer, and accordion, Joel on fiddle, guitar, mandolin, and steel, and Wilson on piano, accordion, fiddle, and guitar, creating a tight, energetic sound rooted in **old‑time Cajun dance music**.[3][4] Marc and Ann had already gained international recognition through the Savoy‑Doucet Cajun Band (with fiddler Michael Doucet) from 1977 onward, touring globally and recording several albums for the Arhoolie label; the family band extended that legacy into the next generation while keeping their focus on house dances, jam sessions, and community gatherings rather than commercial showmanship.[3][4] Their style emphasizes traditional French Cajun repertoire, driving two‑steps and waltzes, and a raw, unvarnished acoustic sound that foregrounds button accordion, fiddle, and close vocal harmonies, yet it is also shaped by Ann’s wide‑ranging folk and blues background and the sons’ contemporary projects.

Within Cajun and roots‑music circles, the Savoy Family Band is often described as a “first family” of Cajun music, emblematic of **“preservation through evolution”**—maintaining core traditions while allowing new influences and collaborations.[1][2] Joel went on to co‑found the Eunice‑based label **Valcour Records**, which has earned multiple GRAMMY nominations and a win for *The Band Courtbouillon*, featuring his brother Wilson, further underscoring the family’s impact on the broader Acadiana music ecosystem.[2] Meanwhile, the Savoy Music Center continues to serve as a pilgrimage site for musicians and fans, where regular jam sessions keep the repertoire alive and where Marc’s hand‑built accordions circulate worldwide.[1][2] Together, the family band and its individual members have helped carry Cajun music from rural Louisiana dance halls to international stages and recordings, shaping how the tradition is heard, studied, and celebrated across generations.[1][2][3][4]





## Fun Facts
- The Savoy Family Band’s first official performance happened almost by accident: Marc and Ann brought their preteen sons Joel and Wilson to play at a friend’s birthday party, and that impromptu gig became the band’s debut.[3]
- Marc Savoy built his first homemade accordion as a child using parts like toilet float rods, a sign of the ingenuity that later led to his renowned Savoy Music Center accordion workshop.[3]
- Ann Savoy, the only family member not born in south Louisiana, first met Marc at the National Folk Festival, where he asked her to dance and charmed her with a line comparing her freckles to a turkey egg—an unusual courtship that launched one of Cajun music’s central partnerships.[5]
- The Savoys’ home base, the Savoy Music Center near Eunice, Louisiana, has become a pilgrimage site for Cajun enthusiasts; Marc has built well over 1,000 accordions there, while regular jam sessions draw musicians from around the world.[1][2]
