# T-Mamou

## Biography
T‑Mamou is a Cajun ensemble project created to spotlight the point where **rural Cajun dance‑hall music and the more polished southwest Louisiana band sound meet**, drawing its name from the small but musically rich Mamou region of Louisiana.[https://flattownmusic.com/artist/t-mamou/] The group was conceived as a collaboration between three respected Cajun musicians—fiddler **Al Berard**, accordionist **Bob Reed**, and guitarist **Sam Broussard**—all of whom were already active in Louisiana’s traditional and progressive Cajun scenes. By pooling their expertise on fiddle, accordion, and guitar, they set out to present repertoire and arrangements that honor the old‑style Mamou sound while using the tighter ensemble feel associated with modern Cajun bands.[https://flattownmusic.com/artist/t-mamou/]

Rather than functioning as a long‑running touring band with a large public profile, T‑Mamou appears as a focused recording/ensemble concept, surfacing on Cajun compilations and catalogs aimed at listeners and dancers seeking authentic south Louisiana French music.[https://flattownmusic.com/artist/t-mamou/][https://open.spotify.com/artist/2uZoXUcwvwT9VZpOldv7Bz] The group’s style leans heavily on **traditional Cajun waltzes and two‑steps**, driven by accordion–fiddle interplay and French vocals typical of the Mamou/Eunice area, but framed with the dynamic guitar work and arrangements that characterize its members’ broader careers. In this sense, T‑Mamou’s legacy is less about fame charts and more about helping document and sustain a specific regional flavor of Cajun music for dancers, families, and cultural preservationists in Louisiana and beyond.[https://flattownmusic.com/artist/t-mamou/]

## Fun Facts
- T‑Mamou is explicitly described by its label as a **three‑way collaboration** between Al Berard (fiddle), Bob Reed (accordion), and Sam Broussard (guitar), rather than a conventional, leader‑centric band.[https://flattownmusic.com/artist/t-mamou/]
- The project is named after **Mamou**, a small town in southwest Louisiana that is widely celebrated as a stronghold of Cajun French language and traditional dance‑hall music, signaling the group’s stylistic home base.[https://flattownmusic.com/artist/t-mamou/][https://www.explorelouisiana.com/cities/mamou]
- T‑Mamou’s guitarist **Sam Broussard** is also a prominent member of **Steve Riley & the Mamou Playboys**, one of the most acclaimed contemporary Cajun bands, and he brings that high‑level arranging and guitar work into the T‑Mamou context.[https://flattownmusic.com/artist/t-mamou/][https://www.mamouplayboys.com/biography/]
- Despite the group’s low commercial profile (only a small number of monthly listeners on streaming services), T‑Mamou is documented and distributed by **Flat Town Music Company**, a specialist Cajun label that curates many key traditional and regional artists.[https://flattownmusic.com/artist/t-mamou/][https://open.spotify.com/artist/2uZoXUcwvwT9VZpOldv7Bz]
