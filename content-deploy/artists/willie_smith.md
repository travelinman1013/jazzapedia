# WILLIE SMITH

## Biography
Willie Lee “Big Eyes” Smith (January 19, 1936 – September 16, 2011) was an American electric blues singer, harmonica player, drummer, and bandleader, best known for his long association with Muddy Waters and his role in shaping the Chicago blues sound.[2] Born in Helena, Arkansas, he was raised primarily by his grandparents before moving to Chicago, where a 1953 visit to the Zanzibar club—hearing Muddy Waters and harmonica player Henry Strong—convinced him to take up the harmonica.[1][2] By 1956, at age eighteen, he was leading his own trio on harp with Bobby Lee Burns on guitar and Clifton James on drums, and he also worked as “Little Willie” Smith in Arthur “Big Boy” Spires’ Rocket Four, cutting sides later reissued by Delmark.[2] In 1955 he recorded harmonica on Bo Diddley’s version of Willie Dixon’s “Diddy Wah Diddy” for the Checker label, a notable early document of his studio work.[1][2]

As electric Chicago blues evolved, Smith recognized there was more work for drummers than harmonica players and switched to drums, a decision that led to his first recordings with Muddy Waters on the 1960 album *Muddy Waters Sings Big Bill Broonzy*.[2] He became a regular member of Muddy’s band in 1961, alongside George “Mojo” Buford, Luther Tucker, Pat Hare, and Otis Spann, and although he briefly left in the mid‑1960s to drive a cab, he rejoined in the late 1960s and stayed through 1980.[1][2] During this period, Muddy’s Grammy‑winning albums—including *Hard Again*, *I’m Ready*, *They Call Me Muddy Waters*, *Muddy “Mississippi” Waters Live*, *The London Muddy Waters Session*, and *The Muddy Waters Woodstock Album*—all fell within Smith’s tenure; he is estimated to have played on twelve sessions yielding around 84 tracks.[2] In 1980 he co‑founded The Legendary Blues Band with fellow Muddy alumni Pinetop Perkins, Calvin Jones, Jerry Portnoy, and Louis Myers, sharing vocal duties and helping carry Chicago blues into new decades.[1][2]

From the mid‑1990s Smith emerged more fully as a leader, beginning with *Bag Full of Blues* (1995), which featured Pinetop Perkins, Kim Wilson, and guitarists James Wheeler, Nick Moss, and Gareth Best, followed by albums such as *Way Back* (2006) and *Born in Arkansas* (2008).[2] His drumming—combining a deep shuffle feel, crisp backbeat, and unflashy but propulsive drive—made him one of the definitive Chicago blues drummers, while his singing and harmonica playing kept him rooted in classic electric blues traditions.[1][2] In 2011 he earned one of the genre’s highest honors, winning the Grammy Award for Best Traditional Blues Album for *Joined at the Hip*, recorded with his longtime friend Pinetop Perkins.[1][2] Even in his final year he was active in the studio, encouraging Chicago singer Liz Mandeville to start her Blue Kitty Music label and appearing on two tracks of her album *Clarksdale*, issued in 2012, underscoring his continuing influence and mentorship in blues up to the end of his life.[2]

## Fun Facts
- Smith received the nickname “Big Eyes” because of his noticeably prominent eyes, a moniker that became part of his professional identity in the blues world.[2]
- He originally made his mark as a harmonica player and only switched to drums when he realized there was more work available for drummers in Chicago clubs.[1][2]
- Before rejoining Muddy Waters in the late 1960s, Smith briefly left music to work as a cab driver in Chicago, illustrating the economic challenges blues musicians often faced.[1][2]
- His Grammy‑winning album *Joined at the Hip* with Pinetop Perkins was released in 2010, and he continued recording right up to the end of his life, appearing on Liz Mandeville’s *Clarksdale*, which came out the year after his death.[1][2]
