## Biography
Panorama Brass Band is a New Orleans–based brass ensemble that grew out of clarinetist **Ben Schenck’s** Panorama Jazz Band in the mid‑1990s, blending the city’s parade and street‑party traditions with a distinctly global songbook.[1][2] Schenck, originally from the Washington, D.C. area, moved to New Orleans in the mid‑1980s after being inspired by the Young Tuxedo Brass Band and clarinetist Michael White, immersing himself in the local brass band and traditional jazz culture.[1][3][4] In 1995 he formed the Panorama Jazz Band (initially a small clarinet‑led group) and by 1997, when a trombone joined the lineup, a dedicated marching offshoot — the Panorama Brass Band — emerged to serve Carnival parades and street events.[1][2][6]

From its earliest years, the Panorama family of bands focused on New Orleans traditional jazz while also embracing Jewish **klezmer**, Eastern European and Balkan folk, and Caribbean/Creole styles such as **biguines**, all reframed through the rhythmic and social context of New Orleans brass band music.[1][2][6] The brass band incarnation became especially active during the Carnival season, performing as an official brass band for krewes such as **Krewe of Red Beans** and **Krewe du Jieux**, and appearing in parades like **Krewe of Muses** and **Knights of Babylon** as well as at weddings, funerals, clubs, and private events locally and abroad.[2] By the 2000s the ensemble typically featured clarinet, alto saxophone, trombone, accordion, banjo, tuba, and drums, and over its first decade it recorded multiple CDs and carved out a niche as a New Orleans group that fused klezmer and Eastern European repertoire with the second‑line and brass band tradition.[1][2]

Today, Panorama Brass Band is recognized for its role in expanding the stylistic boundaries of New Orleans brass band music, demonstrating how traditional parade forms can incorporate diasporic Jewish, Balkan, and Caribbean material while remaining dance‑oriented and community‑based.[1][2][4][6] Their approach builds on Schenck’s belief that New Orleans traditional jazz is not a museum piece but a “culture of possibilities,” where mastery of standards becomes a springboard for new compositions and cross‑cultural arrangements.[4] Within the city’s musical ecosystem, Panorama Brass Band has influenced how some Mardi Gras krewes and local audiences experience klezmer and Eastern European music — not in concert halls, but in the streets, parades, and neighborhood celebrations that define New Orleans social life.[1][2]

## Fun Facts
- Panorama Brass Band began as an extension of a trio that Schenck originally assembled to play at a friend’s wedding in 1995; only after a trombone joined in 1997 did the ensemble fully take on its brass band identity.[1][2][6]
- The Panorama project was first nurtured at Lucky’s on St. Charles Avenue, a now‑legendary New Orleans 24/7 bar–laundromat–music venue that served as an informal laboratory for the evolving lineup and repertoire.[1]
- While many New Orleans brass bands focus mainly on local standards, Panorama Brass Band’s regular book includes Jewish klezmer tunes, Balkan dances, and Creole biguines, all re‑arranged for a traditional New Orleans‑style marching ensemble.[1][2][6]
- Panorama’s blend of klezmer and New Orleans brass band music grew partly out of Schenck’s earlier work with the New Orleans Klezmer All‑Stars; after leaving that group, he doubled down on fusing authentic klezmer phrasing with parade‑style brass arrangements.[1]
