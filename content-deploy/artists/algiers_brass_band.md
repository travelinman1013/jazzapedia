## Biography
There is no evidence in available discographies, jazz and brass band histories, or general music references for a distinct ensemble formally known as the “Algiers Brass Band.” Searches of New Orleans brass band lineages, Algiers (Louisiana) jazz history, and broader brass band documentation show numerous bands that *included* musicians from the Algiers neighborhood—such as the **Pickwick Brass Band**, **Excelsior Brass Band**, and Henry Allen Sr.’s Brass Band—but none referenced specifically as “Algiers Brass Band” as a stable, named performing group.[4][5][7] It is possible that the Spotify entry refers generically to brass bands associated with Algiers or is a mislabeling/metadata artifact rather than a historically documented artist name.

Historically, Algiers (on the West Bank of the Mississippi opposite the French Quarter in New Orleans) was an important source of brass band musicians and a frequent starting point or home base for players who then joined better-documented bands.[4][5] Brass bands connected with Algiers participated in street parades, Mardi Gras Indian events like the Mohawk Hunters, and neighborhood celebrations, contributing significantly to the broader New Orleans brass band tradition.[5][7] However, those activities are consistently credited to other named bands or to Algiers-based musicians individually, not to a standalone group called “Algiers Brass Band.” Given the absence of verifiable references, a conventional biographical narrative (early life, career development, specific recordings, and legacy) for an artist by this exact name cannot be reliably constructed from current credible sources.

Because no authoritative discography entries, liner notes, performance listings, press mentions, or historical overviews specifically identify an “Algiers Brass Band,” any attempt to describe its membership, formation date, recordings, or stylistic evolution would be speculative. The most that can be said with confidence is that Algiers itself has a rich brass band heritage deeply intertwined with the history of New Orleans jazz and parade culture, but this heritage is mapped onto a variety of bands and not onto a clearly documented ensemble under the precise title found in the Spotify metadata.[4][5][7]

## Fun Facts
- The Algiers neighborhood of New Orleans has produced many brass band musicians who played in historically important ensembles such as the Pickwick Brass Band and Excelsior Brass Band, but these groups are not documented under the specific name “Algiers Brass Band.”[4][5]
- Henry Allen Sr.’s Brass Band, which paraded in and around Algiers, is one of the better-documented brass bands associated with the area and included the father of tenor saxophone legend Lester Young.[7]
- The Mohawk Hunters Mardi Gras Indian gang has traditionally paraded with brass bands that include Algiers musicians, underscoring the neighborhood’s continuing role in New Orleans’ street-music culture rather than a single, discrete band called “Algiers Brass Band.”[5]
