# Gary P. Nunn

## Biography
Gary P. Nunn (born December 4, 1945) is an American singer, songwriter, and bandleader widely regarded as one of the founding fathers of the progressive country movement that emerged from Austin, Texas, in the early 1970s.[3][1] Born in Okmulgee, Oklahoma, he moved with his family to Brownfield, Texas, around age 12, where he discovered music in junior high, started his first garage band, and excelled as a student, athlete, and musician.[3][4][7] After high school he attended Texas Tech University and South Plains College, playing in the rock band The Sparkles during the 1960s, before transferring in 1968 to the University of Texas at Austin to study pharmacy and immerse himself in the city’s burgeoning music scene.[3][4]

In Austin, Nunn became a central figure in the so‑called “cosmic cowboy” and progressive country scenes, first with The Lavender Hill Express alongside Rusty Wier and then as a key member of the Lost Gonzo Band, which backed artists such as Michael Martin Murphey and Jerry Jeff Walker.[3][4][6] He played bass and keyboards for Murphey, Walker, and Willie Nelson, appearing on influential 1970s albums and helping define a sound that blended traditional country with rock, folk, and an irreverent outlaw spirit.[3][1][6] Nunn’s signature composition, “London Homesick Blues,” became a breakout track on Walker’s landmark 1973 album ¡Viva Terlingua!, selling over a million copies and serving as the theme song for the PBS television show Austin City Limits from 1977 to 2004, firmly linking his name with Texas music worldwide.[1][3][5] After the Lost Gonzo Band split, he launched a prolific solo career, ultimately releasing dozens of albums and writing over 200 songs characterized by plain‑spoken storytelling, regional pride, and a dance‑hall‑ready Texas country sound.[1][2][4]

In 1985, Nunn moved back to a family farm in Oklahoma, where he ran an 800‑acre cattle operation while continuing to tour and record, and where he founded the Terlingua North Chili Cook‑Off and Music Festival that gave early stage time to future red dirt and Texas country acts such as Pat Green and Cross Canadian Ragweed.[3][4] He later returned to Texas and continued to perform extensively, overseeing his own record label and publishing companies as an independent music pioneer and serving as a de facto musical ambassador for the state.[2][5][6] His songs “London Homesick Blues” and “What I Like About Texas” have become unofficial anthems of Texas, inspiring tourism campaigns and cementing his status as a Lone Star icon.[1][4] Over his multi‑decade career Nunn has earned gold and platinum records, been inducted into multiple Texas music halls of fame, received honors such as the Texas CMA “Living Legend Award” and recognition by the Texas Legislature, and in 2019 made his debut on the Grand Ole Opry, underscoring his enduring influence on Texas country, outlaw country, and the broader Americana tradition.[1][4][5]

## Fun Facts
- Nunn’s song “London Homesick Blues,” with its famous line “I wanna go home with the Armadillo,” was the theme song for the PBS series Austin City Limits for 27 consecutive seasons, from 1977 to 2004.[1][3][5]
- Before becoming a Texas country icon, Nunn played in a 1960s rock band called The Sparkles while attending college, showing that his roots included garage and rock music as well as country.[4]
- In 1985 Nunn moved to an 800‑acre family farm in Oklahoma, where he simultaneously ran a cattle ranch and maintained an active music career, even founding the Terlingua North Chili Cook‑Off and Music Festival on the property.[3][4]
- Nunn has been officially recognized as a musical ambassador for Texas: he was named a “Lone Star Great” by the Texas Commerce and Tourism Department, honored by the Texas Legislature and Governor for his contributions, and later feted at the Grand Ole Opry with hundreds of Texans in attendance.[1][4][5]
